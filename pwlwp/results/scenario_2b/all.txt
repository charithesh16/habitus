Choice A (Those involved in illegal mining have begun working for the Chinese mining company):
Justification: This choice could be justified by the fact that the Chinese government has promoted the new large-scale mining effort as a source of employment for locals engaged in small-scale illegal mining. The context states that "The Chinese President, on the issue of illegal mining in Ghana, and the involvement of some Chinese nationals in the phenomenon, assured President Akufo-Addo that his government will “co-operate with Ghana and tackle the problem,” and indicated his full acceptance of the enforcement of Ghanaian law in the area of illegal mining."

Choice B (Those involved in illegal mining have sought other opportunities outside of the region because of the Chinese mine opening):
Justification: This choice could be justified by the fact that the Chinese government has promoted the new large-scale mining effort as a source of employment for locals engaged in small-scale illegal mining. This could have led to those involved in illegal mining seeking other opportunities outside of the region due to the opening of the Chinese mine. The context states that "The Chinese President, on the issue of illegal mining in Ghana, and the involvement of some Chinese nationals in the phenomenon, assured President Akufo-Addo that his government will “co-operate with Ghana and tackle the problem,” and indicated his full acceptance of the enforcement of Ghanaian law in the area of illegal mining." This suggests that the Chinese government is committed to addressing the issue of illegal mining in Ghana, which could have led to those involved in illegal mining seeking other opportunities outside of the region.

Choice C (Those involved in illegal mining have sought opportunities in small-scale agriculture because of the Chinese mine opening):
Justification: This choice could be justified by the fact that the opening of the Chinese mine could have led to a decrease in illegal mining activities, leading those involved in such activities to seek opportunities in other sectors such as small-scale agriculture. However, the context does not provide specific information about those involved in illegal mining seeking opportunities in small-scale agriculture due to the Chinese mine opening.

Choice D (Those involved in illegal mining have sought other opportunities within the region unrelated to agriculture):
Justification: This choice could be justified by the fact that the opening of the Chinese mine could have led to a decrease in illegal mining activities, leading those involved in such activities to seek other opportunities within the region. However, the context does not provide specific information about those involved in illegal mining seeking opportunities within the region unrelated to agriculture.

Choice E (None of the above):
Justification: This choice could be justified by the fact that the context does not provide specific information about those involved in illegal mining seeking other opportunities outside of the region, in small-scale agriculture, or within the region unrelated to agriculture due to the Chinese mine opening.
