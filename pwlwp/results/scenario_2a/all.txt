Probability for choice C is 13.3%.
Probability for choice D is 36.16%.
Probability for choice E is 1.47%.
The per-choice explanations using the context are: 
Choice A (The Chinese galamseyers have taken all available jobs):
Justification: This could be a possible reason as well. The context suggests that Chinese nationals have been heavily involved in illegal mining activities in Ghana, to the extent that they have taken over many of the available jobs in the sector. For example, it is stated that 'The arrival of the Chinese also saw them effectively out compete existing artisanal miners, leading to the loss of livelihoods and forcing many Ghanaian miners to seek more precarious employment at Chinese mines.' Therefore, if the Chinese galamseyers have taken all available jobs, it could explain why farmers continue to engage in illegal mining at the same rate.

Choice B (The Chinese mining project is less lucrative than illegal mining):
Justification: This could be a plausible reason as to why farmers continue to engage in illegal mining at the same rate. The context suggests that illegal mining, or 'galamsey', is a widespread issue in Ghana, with many locals and foreigners, including Chinese nationals, involved in the activity. The context also indicates that illegal mining can be profitable, with individuals and groups able to make significant profits from the activity. For instance, it is mentioned that 'These Chinese have access to resources in Ghana that they are illegally mining, and those who have permitted them to do so receive a share of the profits.' Therefore, if the Chinese mining project offers less financial reward than illegal mining, it could explain why farmers continue to engage in illegal mining at the same rate.

Choice C (Ghanaians do not want to work for the Chinese):
Justification: This could be another possible reason. The context suggests that there is a degree of resentment and suspicion towards Chinese nationals in Ghana due to their involvement in illegal mining activities. For example, it is stated that '[Ghana] has been looked on with suspicion [by] the public, given [the fact that] Chinese nationals have gained notoriety for involvement in illegal mining activities, with a significant number of them currently [facing] cases in court….' Additionally, it is mentioned that 'There is already a sense of resentment for Chinese because of their involvement in illegal mining, especially in the Western Region.' Therefore, this resentment and suspicion could deter Ghanaians from wanting to work for a Chinese mining company.

Choice D (Ghanaians would prefer to have the option of farming and illegal mining than exclusively work for a Chinese mining company):
Justification: This could be a plausible reason as well. The context suggests that illegal mining is a deeply rooted issue in Ghana, with many locals involved in the activity. It is also mentioned that 'The phenomenon of illegal artisanal mining - known as galamsey, derived from the phrase “gather them and sell” - in Ghana demonstrates the collective impact of individual Chinese migrants.' This suggests that illegal mining is a significant part of the local economy and way of life. Therefore, Ghanaians may prefer to have the option of engaging in both farming and illegal mining, rather than being restricted to working for a Chinese mining company.

Choice E (None of the above):
Justification: This option cannot be justified as the context provides evidence that supports each of the other choices.

CONTEXT:

The illegal mining actually tops legal mining and a number of Chinese national are involved.

These Chinese have access to resources in Ghana that they are illegally mining, and those who have permitted them to do so receive a share of the profits.

So, we have no problem with Chinese investment in Ghana; but we do have a problem with those who engage in illegal mining.

The arrest and detention of Asia Huang may seem as rule of law because foreign nationals are not allowed by law to engage in small scale mining in Ghana, the rationale behind this is understood, but what kind of law, in one vein does not allow Chinese to do galamsey whiles in another vein allow multinational mining corporations to exploit a country’s natural resources, make huge profit and then pay crumbs to the nation in taxes.

The phenomenon of illegal artisanal mining - known as galamsey, derived from the phrase “gather them and sell” - in Ghana demonstrates the collective impact of individual Chinese migrants.

Even though the illegal mining is done by locals, it has emerged that Chinese nationals are also cashing in on the illegal business.

Illegal mining is definitely having a toll on the country but with discussions on how to increase Ghana’s gold production, the focus must be on more local investments.
