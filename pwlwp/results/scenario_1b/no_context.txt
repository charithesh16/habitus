The per-choice explanations using the context are: 
Choice A (Ghanaians involved in illegal mining do not trust the government and would prefer to operate without a license):
Justification: If the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same even after the implementation of the new reform, it could be because the Ghanaians involved in illegal mining do not trust the government and would prefer to operate without a license. The context does not provide any information about the level of trust between the illegal miners and the government. If the illegal miners do not trust the government, they might not apply for a license, and hence the number of licenses granted would remain the same. This could be due to their past experiences with the government, or due to their belief that they can operate more freely without a license.

Choice B (Ghanaians who would like a license are unaware of the new, expedited licensing process):
Justification: If the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same even after the implementation of the new reform, it could be because the Ghanaians who would like a license are unaware of the new, expedited licensing process. The context does not provide any information about the government's efforts to communicate the changes to the public. If the people who are interested in obtaining a license are not aware of the new process, they would not apply for it, and hence the number of licenses granted would remain the same. This lack of awareness could be due to a lack of effective communication from the government, or due to the fact that the information has not reached the intended audience for various reasons.

Choice C (Ghanaians think three months is too long to obtain a mining license):
Justification: The new reform has reduced the time it takes to obtain a mining license from three years to three months. However, if the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same, it could be because Ghanaians still think that three months is too long to obtain a mining license. The context does not provide any information about the public's perception of the new timeline. If the potential applicants think that the process is still too lengthy, they might not apply for a license, and hence the number of licenses granted would remain the same. This could be due to their urgent need for income, or due to their perception that the process should be quicker.

Choice D (Ghanaians involved in illegal mining do not want to risk being taxed by authorities, while Ghanaians that are not involved in illegal mining are not interested in legal mining):
Justification: If the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same even after the implementation of the new reform, it could be because the Ghanaians involved in illegal mining do not want to risk being taxed by authorities, while those that are not involved in illegal mining are not interested in legal mining. The context does not provide any information about the attitudes of these two groups towards the new reform. If the illegal miners are afraid of being taxed and the non-miners are not interested in mining, they would not apply for a license, and hence the number of licenses granted would remain the same. This could be due to their fear of financial burden or due to their lack of interest in the mining industry.

Choice E (None of the above):
Justification: If the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same even after the implementation of the new reform, it could be due to reasons not mentioned in the above options. The context does not provide any information about other potential reasons. There could be various other factors influencing the number of licenses granted, such as the economic conditions, the demand for mining products, the availability of alternative income sources, etc. Without more information, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.
