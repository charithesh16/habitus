The per-choice explanations using the context are: 
Choice A (Those previously involved in illegal mining have started to move back to farming):
Justification: This option suggests that the increase in farming activities could be due to individuals previously involved in illegal mining moving back to farming. The context mentions that the U.S. committed $10 million to promote the agricultural sector in southern Ghana. This financial commitment could have incentivized individuals previously involved in illegal mining to move back to farming, as it presents a more sustainable and legal financial opportunity. This could have led to an increase in the number of farmers in the region, and consequently, a doubling of farming activities.

Choice B (Those who were never engaged in mining or farming have decided to take advantage of the financial opportunity):
Justification: This option suggests that the increase in farming activities in southern Ghana could be due to individuals who were previously not engaged in farming or mining deciding to take advantage of the financial opportunity presented by the U.S.-led effort. The context mentions that the U.S. committed $10 million to promote the agricultural sector in southern Ghana, which is tied to sustainability and climate change. This financial commitment could have incentivized individuals who were not previously engaged in farming or mining to start farming, as it presents a new financial opportunity. This could be a plausible reason for the doubling of farming activities in the region.

Choice C (Traditional farmers have increased output because of U.S.-led financing):
Justification: This option suggests that the increase in farming activities could be due to traditional farmers increasing their output as a result of the U.S.-led financing. The context mentions that the U.S. committed $10 million to promote the agricultural sector in southern Ghana. This financial commitment could have provided traditional farmers with the necessary resources to increase their farming activities. This could include purchasing more seeds, hiring more labor, or acquiring more land for farming. As a result, the output of traditional farmers could have increased, leading to a doubling of farming activities in the region.

Choice D (Farmers from neighboring regions have immigrated to southern Ghana):
Justification: This option suggests that the increase in farming activities could be due to farmers from neighboring regions immigrating to southern Ghana. The context mentions that the U.S. committed $10 million to promote the agricultural sector in southern Ghana. This financial commitment could have attracted farmers from neighboring regions to immigrate to southern Ghana to take advantage of the financial opportunity. This could have led to an increase in the number of farmers in the region, and consequently, a doubling of farming activities.

Choice E (None of the above):
Justification: This option suggests that none of the previous options are the most likely reason for the doubling of farming activities in southern Ghana. However, the context mentions that the U.S. committed $10 million to promote the agricultural sector in southern Ghana. This financial commitment could have led to a variety of outcomes, including attracting new farmers, increasing the output of traditional farmers, or attracting farmers from neighboring regions. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the above options are the most likely reason for the doubling of farming activities.
