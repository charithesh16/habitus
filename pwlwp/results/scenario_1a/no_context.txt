The per-choice explanations using the context are: 
Choice A (Ghanaians that were participating in illegal mining felt comfortable applying for a license because of the shortened wait time):
Justification: The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have encouraged Ghanaians who were previously participating in illegal mining to apply for a license. The previous three-year wait time might have been a deterrent, leading some to engage in illegal mining rather than wait for a license. However, with the reform reducing the wait time to just three months, these individuals might have felt more comfortable applying for a license. This could have contributed to the tripling of mining license applications within three months of the reform.

Choice B (Ghanaians who were not previously mining now see it as a new economic opportunity):
Justification: The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have made mining a more attractive economic opportunity for Ghanaians who were not previously involved in the sector. The previous three-year wait time might have been a significant barrier to entry, discouraging many from pursuing a mining license due to the long wait and uncertainty. However, with the reform reducing the wait time to just three months, this barrier has been significantly lowered. This could have encouraged more Ghanaians to see mining as a viable economic opportunity, leading to an increase in the number of mining license applications.

Choice C (Ghanaians are influenced to seek mining licenses by their friends/family):
Justification: The tripling of mining license applications within three months of the reform could be due to social influence. Friends and family members who have successfully obtained mining licenses within the shortened timeframe could have shared their positive experiences, encouraging others to also apply. This could have created a ripple effect, leading to an increase in the number of applications. However, the context does not provide direct evidence of this social influence, so this explanation is speculative.

Choice D (None of the above):
Justification: The option "None of the above" suggests that neither of the previous explanations is correct. However, without additional context or alternative explanations, it's difficult to justify this choice. The context provided does not rule out the possibility that either or both of the previous explanations could be correct. Therefore, choosing "None of the above" would require additional information not provided in the context.
