Probability for choice E is 3.59%.
The per-choice explanations using the context are: 
Choice A (Those involved in illegal mining would listen to their friends and stop):
Justification: This choice is not directly supported by the context sentences. The context does not provide specific information about the personal motivations or attitudes of those involved in illegal mining towards the opinions of their friends. However, the persistence of illegal mining activities despite their devastating effects and public outrage suggests that those involved may not readily stop their activities based on the opinions of others.

Choice B (Those involved in illegal mining would continue in secret):
Justification: This choice is plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a persistent issue despite its devastating effects on the environment and agriculture. For instance, one context sentence states, "Illegal mining is not gone completely, but the impact has been felt." This suggests that despite the negative impacts and potential consequences, illegal mining activities continue. Furthermore, another context sentence mentions, "Despite a government ban on illegal mining, illegal miners have invaded forest reserves, destroyed cocoa farms, and polluted many water bodies, a development that has sparked public outrage." This indicates that illegal miners continue their activities even in the face of government bans and public outrage, possibly in secret to avoid detection and punishment.

Choice C (Those involved in illegal mining would not care about the opinions of their close friends or family):
Justification: This choice is plausible but not directly supported by the context sentences. The context does not provide specific information about the personal motivations or attitudes of those involved in illegal mining towards the opinions of their close friends or family. However, the persistence of illegal mining activities despite their devastating effects on the environment, agriculture, and communities suggests a disregard for the broader societal and environmental impacts, which could extend to the opinions of close friends or family.

Choice D (Those involved in illegal mining would relocate to a different region, where they would continue mining):
Justification: This choice is plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining activities have been widespread and have occurred in different regions. For instance, one context sentence states, "Illegal mining continues to wreak havoc on land, forest reserves and water bodies in mining communities, especially in the Ashanti, Eastern, Western and Western North regions." This suggests that illegal miners may relocate to different regions to continue their activities, especially if they face opposition or crackdowns in their current locations.

Choice E (None of the above):
Justification: This choice is not supported by the context sentences. The context sentences provide evidence that supports each of the other choices to varying degrees.
