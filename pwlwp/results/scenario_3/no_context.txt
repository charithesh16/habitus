The per-choice explanations using the context are: 
Choice A (Those involved in illegal mining would listen to their friends and stop):
Justification: This choice is not directly supported by the context. The context does not provide any information about the miners' personal relationships or their attitudes towards the opinions of their friends. Furthermore, the fact that they are involved in illegal activities suggests they might be willing to disregard the opinions of others in pursuit of their own interests. Therefore, while it's possible that some miners might decide to stop due to the influence of their friends, the context does not provide any specific evidence to support this.

Choice B (Those involved in illegal mining would continue in secret):
Justification: This choice is plausible given the context. The illegal miners are already operating outside the law, so it's reasonable to assume they might continue their activities in secret despite the protests and tensions. The context does not provide any information that would suggest the miners are likely to stop due to public pressure. However, the increased attention from the protests might make it more difficult for them to continue their activities without being detected.

Choice C (Those involved in illegal mining would not care about the opinions of their close friends or family):
Justification: This choice is also plausible, but it's not directly supported by the context. The context does not provide any information about the miners' personal relationships or their attitudes towards the opinions of their friends and family. However, the fact that they are involved in illegal activities suggests they might be willing to disregard the opinions of others in pursuit of their own interests.

Choice D (Those involved in illegal mining would relocate to a different region, where they would continue mining):
Justification: This choice is plausible and is indirectly supported by the context. The context suggests that the miners are motivated by economic interests, and if their current location becomes too risky due to the protests and tensions, they might decide to relocate to a different region where they can continue their activities with less risk. However, the context does not provide any specific information about the likelihood of this happening.

Choice E (None of the above):
Justification: This choice is not plausible given the context. The context suggests that the illegal miners are motivated by economic interests and are willing to operate outside the law. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they would take some action in response to the protests and tensions, whether that's continuing in secret, disregarding the opinions of others, or relocating to a different region.
