Probability for choice E is 2.18%.
The per-choice explanations using the context are: 
Choice A (Those involved in illegal mining would listen to their friends and stop):
Justification: This choice is not directly supported by the context sentences. The context does not provide specific information about the personal relationships or motivations of those involved in illegal mining. However, given the persistence of illegal mining activities despite their negative impacts, it seems unlikely that those involved would easily be persuaded to stop by their friends. For instance, one sentence states, "Illegal mining is a primary source of livelihood for many people in the mining communities." This suggests that economic necessity may override personal relationships in the decision to engage in illegal mining.

Choice B (Those involved in illegal mining would continue in secret):
Justification: This choice is plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a persistent issue despite its negative impacts on the environment and communities. For instance, one sentence states, "Despite a government ban on illegal mining, illegal miners have invaded forest reserves, destroyed cocoa farms, and polluted many water bodies, a development that has sparked public outrage." This suggests that illegal miners are willing to continue their activities in secret, even in the face of government bans and public outrage. Furthermore, another sentence mentions that "During the period that the ban on small scale mining was in force, more illegal miners, including Chinese gangs invaded our forest reserves with the help of government officials and caused unprecedented destruction to our forests, water bodies and environment." This further supports the idea that illegal miners may continue their activities in secret, even when faced with legal and societal pressures.

Choice C (Those involved in illegal mining would not care about the opinions of their close friends or family):
Justification: This choice is plausible but not directly supported by the context sentences. The context does not provide specific information about the personal relationships or motivations of those involved in illegal mining. However, given the persistence of illegal mining activities despite their negative impacts, it can be inferred that those involved may prioritize their economic interests over the opinions of their close friends or family. For instance, one sentence states, "Illegal mining is a primary source of livelihood for many people in the mining communities." This suggests that economic necessity may override personal relationships in the decision to engage in illegal mining.

Choice D (Those involved in illegal mining would relocate to a different region, where they would continue mining):
Justification: This choice is plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining activities have been widespread and have occurred in different regions. For instance, one sentence states, "The country has been battling with the upsurge in illegal mining across the country as the practice is depleting the land and destroying farm lands, forest reserves and water bodies." This suggests that illegal miners may be willing and able to relocate to different regions to continue their activities. Furthermore, another sentence mentions that "Today, illegal mining has become a major source of livelihood for persons living around legal mining communities, mainly due to the continuous rise of the price of the commodity on the world market." This further supports the idea that economic incentives may drive illegal miners to relocate and continue their activities in different regions.

Choice E (None of the above):
Justification: This choice is not supported by the context. The context sentences provide evidence that supports each of the other choices to varying degrees. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that none of the above choices would occur.
