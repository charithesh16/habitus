    "choice": "Due to the reduced waiting period, Ghanaians involved in illegal mining felt more at ease to apply for a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences highlight the issue of illegal mining in Ghana and the government's efforts to combat it. For instance, the context states that 'the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians.' This suggests that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana, and the government is taking steps to deter it. Therefore, reducing the waiting period for obtaining a legal mining license could encourage those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license instead. This would allow them to continue their mining activities without the risk of severe penalties."

    "choice": "It is now seen as a fresh economic prospect by Ghanaians who had not been involved in mining before.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context provided. The context sentences suggest that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, and many Ghanaians are involved in it. For instance, the context states that 'the nation ought to aspire for more local participation in the mining industry.' This suggests that mining is seen as a viable economic activity in Ghana. Therefore, reducing the waiting period for obtaining a mining license could attract Ghanaians who had not been involved in mining before. They might see it as a fresh economic prospect that they can now access more easily."

    "choice": "The encouragement from friends and family has led Ghanaians to apply for mining licenses.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is less plausible given the context provided. The context sentences do not provide any information about the influence of friends and family on Ghanaians' decisions to apply for mining licenses. While it is possible that friends and family could encourage Ghanaians to apply for mining licenses, especially given the reduced waiting period, there is no direct evidence in the context to support this claim."

    "choice": "None of the previously mentioned reasons.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is unlikely given the context provided. The context sentences suggest that both the reduced waiting period for obtaining a mining license and the economic prospects of mining in Ghana could have contributed to the increase in mining license applications. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the previously mentioned reasons would be the cause of the increase."
