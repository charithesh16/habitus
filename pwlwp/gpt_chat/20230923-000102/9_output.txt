    "choice": "Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining felt encouraged to apply for a license due to the decreased wait time.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a significant issue in Ghana, with the government implementing various measures to combat it. For instance, the context states, 'the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians.' This suggests that the risk of engaging in illegal mining has increased, which could motivate illegal miners to seek legal avenues. The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license from three years to three months could be seen as a significant improvement, making the process of legal mining more accessible and appealing to those previously engaged in illegal mining."

    "choice": "Ghanaians, who had not been mining before, now perceive it as a novel economic possibility.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, with both small-scale and large-scale operations. The context states, 'the vision that our President has will go a long way in vindicating the measures that are rolled out to propel the future of the small-scale mining industry.' This suggests that mining is seen as a viable economic opportunity. The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could make mining more accessible to Ghanaians who had not previously considered it, as it reduces the barriers to entry into the industry."

    "choice": "Ghanaians have been persuaded by their friends and family to seek mining licenses.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "While this choice is possible, the context sentences do not provide direct evidence to support it. The context does not mention the role of friends and family in influencing individuals to seek mining licenses. However, it is plausible that friends and family could play a role in influencing individuals' decisions, particularly in a context where mining is a significant industry and the process of obtaining a mining license has been made more accessible."

    "choice": "None of the prior stated causes.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice suggests that none of the previously stated causes are responsible for the increase in mining license applications. Given the context sentences, this seems unlikely. The context indicates that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, and the government has taken steps to make legal mining more accessible and appealing, such as reducing the time it takes to obtain a mining license. These factors suggest that the previously stated causes could plausibly contribute to an increase in mining license applications."
