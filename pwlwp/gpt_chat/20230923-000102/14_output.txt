```The reduced wait time made Ghanaians who were participating in illegal mining feel more inclined to apply for a license.```
This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences highlight the issue of illegal mining in Ghana and the government's efforts to combat it. For instance, the context states, "The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians." This suggests that the government has been taking strict measures against illegal mining. Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have encouraged those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license instead, to avoid the harsh penalties associated with illegal mining.

```For those Ghanaians who weren't previously involved in mining, it's now seen as a new economic venture.```
This choice is also plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, with both small-scale and large-scale operations. For example, the context states, "Sanctioning the moratorium on the operations of general small-scale mining activities in Ghana has brought untold hardship on us and most Ghanaians in the areas where the small-scale mining is based." This suggests that mining is a significant source of income for many Ghanaians. Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made mining more accessible and attractive as an economic venture for those who were not previously involved in the industry.

```Ghanaians are applying for mining licenses due to the influence of their friends and family.```
This choice is less supported by the context provided. While the context sentences do discuss the importance of mining in Ghana and the government's efforts to regulate the industry, they do not specifically mention the influence of friends and family on individuals' decisions to apply for mining licenses. Therefore, while it is possible that some Ghanaians are applying for mining licenses due to the influence of their friends and family, this is not directly supported by the context provided.

```None of the previously discussed scenarios.```
This choice is unlikely given the context provided. The context sentences discuss the importance of mining in Ghana and the government's efforts to regulate the industry, including reducing the time it takes to obtain a mining license. Therefore, it is likely that at least one of the previously discussed scenarios is contributing to the increase in mining license applications.
