```Ghanaians who were involved in illegal mining felt less hesitant to apply for a license because of the reduced wait time.```
This choice is plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a significant issue in Ghana, with the government implementing harsh penalties for those caught engaging in such activities. For instance, the context states, "the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians." Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have encouraged those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license instead, as it would significantly reduce their risk of facing these severe penalties.

```Ghanaians who hadn't previously mined now regard it as a fresh financial prospect.```
This choice is also plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, with the potential for substantial financial gain. For example, the context states, "once the Company, TGGL warranted that it had the wherewithal in terms of finance, technical, and human resources to undertake efficient mining operations, and had declared its willingness to engage in mining in Ghana, the Government of Ghana could not, but grant the rights to mine in the specified area to it." Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have encouraged Ghanaians who hadn't previously been involved in mining to consider it as a new financial opportunity.

```The influence of their friends and family has prompted Ghanaians to seek mining licenses.```
This choice is less directly supported by the context sentences, but it is still plausible. The context sentences do not explicitly mention the influence of friends and family on individuals' decisions to seek mining licenses. However, the context does indicate that mining is a significant part of many communities in Ghana, with the potential for substantial financial gain. For example, the context states, "Sanctioning the moratorium on the operations of general small-scale mining activities in Ghana has brought untold hardship on us and most Ghanaians in the areas where the small-scale mining is based." Therefore, it is possible that the influence of friends and family who are involved in mining or who have been affected by the moratorium could have prompted others to seek mining licenses.

```None of the earlier mentioned possibilities.```
This choice is unlikely given the context. The context sentences provide support for each of the previous choices, indicating that they are all plausible explanations for the increase in mining license applications following the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a license. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the earlier mentioned possibilities would be the reason for the increase in applications.
