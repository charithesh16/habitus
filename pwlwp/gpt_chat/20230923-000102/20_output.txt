```Ghanaians involved in illegal mining felt more confident in applying for a license due to the reduced wait time.```
This choice could be justified by the fact that the Ghanaian government has been actively fighting against illegal mining activities, as indicated by the context sentence: "The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians, and a minimum of 20 years imprisonment, together with a fine of not less than 100,000 penalty units for foreigners with the hope that those found guilty would be made to face the full rigorous of the law." The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have encouraged those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license, as it would allow them to continue their activities without the risk of severe punishment.

```Ghanaians who were not previously part of the mining sector now see it as a new economic opportunity.```
This choice could be justified by the fact that the mining sector in Ghana is a significant contributor to the country's economy, as indicated by the context sentence: "Delivering a paper on the topic, “The Legal Regime of the Mining Sector in Ghana”, at a public lecture in Kumasi, organized by the Students’ Representative Council (SRC) of the Ghana School of Law, the Minister said the nation ought to aspire for more local participation in the mining industry." The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have attracted Ghanaians who were not previously part of the mining sector to see it as a new economic opportunity.

```The influence from their friends and family has driven Ghanaians to seek mining licenses.```
This choice could be justified by the fact that mining is a significant part of many local communities in Ghana, as indicated by the context sentence: "Even though sanctioning the moratorium on the operations of general small scale mining activities in Ghana has brought untold hardship on us and most Ghanaians in the areas where the small scale mining are based, it is practically our hope that, the vision that our President has will go a long way in vindicating the measures that is rolled out to propel the future of the small scale mining industry." The influence from friends and family who are involved in mining could have driven more Ghanaians to seek mining licenses, especially with the reduced wait time.

```None of the earlier discussed factors.```
This choice could be justified by the fact that the context sentences do not provide any clear evidence that any of the earlier discussed factors were the primary reason for the increase in mining license applications. The increase could have been due to a variety of other factors not discussed in the context sentences, such as changes in economic conditions, government policies, or international demand for minerals.
