    "choice": "Ghanaians that were participating in illegal mining felt comfortable applying for a license because of the shortened wait time",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a significant issue in Ghana, with the government implementing various measures to combat it, including increased penalties for those engaging in illegal mining. The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have made the process of legal mining more appealing to those who were previously participating in illegal mining. As stated in the context, \"The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians\". This suggests that the reduction in wait time could have been a significant factor in encouraging illegal miners to apply for a license."

    "choice": "Ghanaians who were not previously mining now see it as a new economic opportunity",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, and the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made it more accessible to those who were not previously involved in mining. As stated in the context, \"Delivering a paper on the topic, “The Legal Regime of the Mining Sector in Ghana”, at a public lecture in Kumasi, organized by the Students’ Representative Council (SRC) of the Ghana School of Law, the Minister said the nation ought to aspire for more local participation in the mining industry\". This suggests that the reduction in wait time could have been seen as a new economic opportunity by Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining."

    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is less supported by the context sentences. While it is possible that Ghanaians could be influenced by their friends or family to seek mining licenses, the context sentences do not provide specific evidence to support this. The context sentences focus more on the government's efforts to combat illegal mining and encourage legal mining, rather than the influence of friends or family on individuals' decisions to seek mining licenses."

    "justification": "This choice is not supported by the context sentences. The context sentences provide evidence to support the first two choices, indicating that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have encouraged both those who were previously participating in illegal mining and those who were not previously involved in mining to apply for a license."
