    "choice": "The shortened wait time encouraged Ghanaians involved in illegal mining to feel more comfortable applying for a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a significant issue in Ghana, with the government implementing various measures to combat it. For instance, the context states, \"the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians.\" This suggests that illegal mining was a risky endeavor due to the severe penalties involved. Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have encouraged those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license instead, as it became a quicker and safer alternative."

    "choice": "It is now seen as a new economic avenue by Ghanaians who were not previously in mining.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, with both local and foreign entities involved. For instance, the context states, \"the Minister said the nation ought to aspire for more local participation in the mining industry.\" This suggests that mining is seen as a potentially lucrative industry. Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made mining more accessible to Ghanaians who were not previously involved in the industry, leading them to see it as a new economic avenue."

    "choice": "Ghanaians have been inspired by their friends and family to seek mining licenses.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible but less directly supported by the context provided. The context sentences do not explicitly mention the influence of friends and family on individuals' decisions to seek mining licenses. However, the context does indicate that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, and it is reasonable to infer that individuals could be influenced by their social networks to participate in this industry. For instance, the context states, \"the vision that our President has will go a long way in vindicating the measures that are rolled out to propel the future of the small-scale mining industry.\" This suggests a positive outlook on the mining industry, which could inspire individuals to seek mining licenses."

    "choice": "None of the previously mentioned scenarios.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is unlikely given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, and the government has been implementing measures to regulate it and encourage legal mining. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have influenced the number of applications received by the government, as suggested by the previous scenarios."
