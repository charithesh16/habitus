```The shortened wait time made Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining feel more confident to apply for a license.```
This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context mentions that illegal mining has been a significant issue in Ghana, with the government implementing strict punishments for those caught engaging in such activities. For instance, the context states, "the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians." Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have encouraged those engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license. This would allow them to continue their mining activities without the fear of facing severe penalties.

```For Ghanaians who had no prior involvement in mining, it is now viewed as a new financial opportunity.```
This choice is also plausible given the context. The context mentions that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, with many Ghanaians involved in it. For instance, the context states, "Despite the conventional knowledge in Ghana that the activities of some mining companies have severely impacted negatively on the environment, coupled with the notion that not enough is being done about this by sector regulators, this might not exactly be the situation in every circumstance." Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have made mining more accessible to Ghanaians who had no prior involvement in the industry, viewing it as a new financial opportunity.

```The push from their friends or family has influenced Ghanaians to pursue mining licenses.```
This choice is plausible but less likely given the context provided. The context does not explicitly mention the influence of friends or family on Ghanaians' decision to pursue mining licenses. However, it is possible that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have encouraged friends or family members already involved in the industry to push others to pursue mining licenses. This could be especially true given the significant role mining plays in the Ghanaian economy and the potential financial benefits it can bring.

```None of the aforementioned factors.```
This choice is unlikely given the context provided. The context suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have had a significant impact on the number of applications received by the government. Whether it was due to Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining feeling more confident to apply for a license, Ghanaians who had no prior involvement in mining viewing it as a new financial opportunity, or the influence of friends or family, it is likely that at least one of these factors played a role in the increase in applications.
