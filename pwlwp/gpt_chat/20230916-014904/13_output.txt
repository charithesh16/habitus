1. The outcome of illegal gold mining is no longer justified given the high risk.

From the information given, we learn that the price of gold has decreased sharply due to increased discovery of gold in a neighboring country, making illegal mining less profitable. Additionally, the significant environmental damage caused by illegal mining (implied by the statement about the detrimental impact on Ghana's farmlands and the destruction of water bodies), the legal consequences (such as arrests and deportations of illegal miners), and the increase in violence (indicated by the reference to killings due to illegal mining) suggest that the risks associated with illegal gold mining have increased, justifying this statement. 

Citation: "The Rush for Gold through illegal gold mining has led to the destruction of majority of water bodies in Ghana leading to the increase in morbidity across all regions selected for this study," "In 2013, the Ghanaian government arrested 168 Chinese nationals on suspicion of illegal gold mining," "Illegal gold mining have lead to the killing of some Ghanaian nationals by other nationals due to illegal mining."

2. Illicit gold miners are presently relocating to foreign destinations where the superior value of gold is sustained.

Based on the text, there is no direct evidence to support this statement. However, it can be surmised that if illegal miners are finding the trade less profitable in Ghana due to the plummeting prices, they might seek opportunities elsewhere. 

Citation: Inference made from, "a pound of gold is worth $30,000... illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold. Illegal mining has started to decline across the country."

3. The options highlighted above do not apply.

This option is ranked third because it argues from a position of non-applicability. Using the information given, we established that despite no direct statements on the provided options, we could surmise possible implications and consequences based on the context and circumstances described, rendering this option less accurate.

4. This selection is the correct one.

This phrase does not provide a specific stance. Therefore, it cannot be accurately assessed and ranked based on the provided information.

5. This resolution is not correct.

Like the previous phrase, there's no proposition given to determine if it's true or false about the current situation pertaining to gold mining in Ghana, which makes this statement unsuitable to rank. The information given does not provide context to this.
