1. The risks involved in illegal gold mining outweigh any potential rewards. 

Evidence: 
- "Illegal gold mining operations are criticized heavily throughout Ghana due to their detrimental environmental effects, which many believe outweigh any possible economic and cultural justifications." 
- "The Rush for Gold through illegal gold mining has led to the destruction of majority of water bodies in Ghana leading to the increase in morbidity across all regions selected for this study."
- "As one of the largest gold producers and exporters in Africa, Ghana has been waging a war against illegal mining, which has caused pollution of major water bodies in mineral-rich territories."
- "In 2013, the Ghanaian government arrested 168 Chinese nationals on suspicion of illegal gold mining, following reports of environmental devastation and social unrest."
- “It is terrible to see the daily reports about the negative impact of illegal mining on the water resources of the country."
- In Ghana, a crackdown on illegal miners exploiting the gold industry led to the deportation of thousands of Chinese nationals from the country."
- "It is important to note that the very existence of Ghana as a country is being threatened by illegal mining activities."

Evidence: 
- "Imagine that gold is discovered in a neighboring country in even greater quantities, shifting the mining industry and causing prices to plummet in Ghana. Now, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold. Illegal mining has started to decline across the country."
- "Large quantities of gold illegally smuggled to neighbouring countries without documentation, thus creating a huge revenue shortfall for Ghana."
- "The Chinese embassy in Ghana has, instead, resorted to legalisms over the issue; i.e., they say that because it's Ghanaians who take Chinese nationals to where the gold is, the Chinese Government cannot do anything about it."
- "Delivering an address on the theme “The Scourge of Extremism in the Sub-region, Threats to Ghana’s Security, Stability and Socio Economic Development”...illegal mining sites have become attractive convergence points for those who seek to hurt this country because gold is small, it is easy to dispose off, it is highly valuable…"
