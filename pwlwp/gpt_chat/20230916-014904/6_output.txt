1. The returns from illicit gold extraction no longer outweigh the hazards.

The information suggests that the decrease in the price of gold in Ghana has rendered illegal mining less profitable - "Now, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold" and "Illegal mining has started to decline across the country." Moreover, "Illegal gold mining operations are criticised heavily throughout Ghana due to their detrimental environmental effects," further indicating that the risks associated with the illegal activity might no longer be deemed worth the potential, albeit reduced, profits (Source: Context sentences).

2. People partaking in illegal activities like gold mining are now relocating internationally, where gold maintains its high worth.

There's no clear evidence given that illegal miners are moving abroad. However, "Ghana’s tradition of artisanal gold mining and the gold price boom which began in 2007 led tens of thousands of Chinese migrants to seek their fortunes in Ghana" shows that, historically, miners have moved to places where the gold price was high (Source: Context sentences). Additionally, "Ghana has been waging a war against illegal mining," which might be driving miners to relocate to less restrictive regions, though this is speculative based on the information provided (Source: Context sentences).

3. No choices listed above are applicable.

This ranking could be less valid as the information provided does seem to support the first two options to some degree, as discussed above. Despite this, without specific evidence demonstrating miners relocating abroad, the second option’s certainty is a bit tenuous and might lend some credibility to this choice (Source: Context sentences).
