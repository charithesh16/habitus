1. The returns associated with clandestine gold mining no longer merit the risk
Citing from the text: "Imagine that gold is discovered in a neighboring country in even greater quantities, shifting the mining industry and causing prices to plummet in Ghana. Now, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold." This suggests that the returns from illegal gold mining in Ghana no longer merit the associated risks.

2. Gold diggers involved in illegal practice have begun to transition overseas, where gold still fetches a higher price.
The text does not provide any direct information on this. However, stating "Large quantities of gold illegally smuggled to neighbouring countries without documentation" suggests that gold miners could potentially be transitioning overseas for higher prices.
