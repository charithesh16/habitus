1. The reward from unlawful gold mining is no longer worth the danger.
The current Ghanaian market has experienced a drop in the prices of gold due to its discovery in large quantities in neighboring countries, and therefore, even illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold. This drop in price has likely contributed to the decline of illegal mining. Also, illegal mining is criticized heavily due to its detrimental environmental effects, which could make it riskier in the face of law enforcement and environmental protection efforts (Source: The given context).

2. Individuals engaged in unlawful gold mining are currently venturing overseas where gold still carries a greater value.
Gold is exported from Ghana to other countries, with 'galamsey' activity increasing with the gold price boom. There is evidence of gold being illegally smuggled to neighboring countries, thus some illegal miners may be venturing overseas instead. But, since the reward associated with illegal mining within Ghana is declining, this might not necessarily be the best choice for illegal miners. (Source: The given context).
