1. The benefits of illegal gold prospecting are no longer proportional to the risks involved.
This can be inferred from the lines "The Rush for Gold through illegal gold mining has led to the destruction of majority of water bodies in Ghana," "Illegal gold mining operations are criticized heavily throughout Ghana due to their detrimental environmental effects," and the plummeting prices due to the discovery of gold in neighboring countries making illegal gold mining less profitable.

2. The illegal gold miners are starting to go abroad, where the precious metal remains more valuable. 
There is no explicit information directly supporting this statement in the given context; however, one can draw upon the information that "gold is discovered in a neighboring country in even greater quantities," suggesting the potential for miners to move operations.

3. Nothing from those noted previously.
Citing information stated previously, both illegal gold prospecting no longer being worth the risk and potential for miners to go abroad hold some degree of truth based on the context provided. It isn't a blank negation.

4. This selection isn't appropriate.
This option does not offer any concrete statement or claim to be evaluated and thus stands as the least suitable option.
