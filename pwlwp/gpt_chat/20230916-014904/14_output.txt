1. The payoff of illegal gold mining no longer justifies the risk.

Many factors support this assertion. As noted, the price of gold sold by illegal miners has drastically decreased from $420 to $200 due to the significant discovery of gold in neighboring countries and a consequent shift in the mining industry (First Sentence). Additionally, the rampant environmental destruction and water pollution brought about by illegal mining efforts are causing indignation among communities, making it riskier for illegal miners to operate (Research Sentence 13, 20). Furthermore, the government continues their crackdown on illegal miners, which included the arrest and deportation of many foreigners involved in such operations (Research Sentence 33, 36).

2. Those involved in illegal gold mining are now moving abroad, where the value of gold is still higher.

There's mention of Chinese traders seeking their fortunes in Ghana due to the gold price boom (Research Sentence 6, 11). This evidence points out the possibility of illegal miners considering migrating to other countries where gold prices remain high and where practices might be less scrutinized than in Ghana. However, this statement is not as strongly backed by references in the given data, compared to the first option.

3. None of the above.

The two given justifications both originate from the provided data. Thus, saying "None of the above" is not the best choice based on the available information.
