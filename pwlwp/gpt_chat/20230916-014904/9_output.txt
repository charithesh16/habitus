1. The ones participating in unsanctioned gold mining have begun shifting to foreign lands where the value of gold is still high. 
This alternative is ranked first based on the information provided. It is stated that the "gold is discovered in a neighboring country in even greater quantities, shifting the mining industry and causing prices to plummet in Ghana." This decrease in prices is causing illegal miners to receive less for the gold, potentially motivating them to seek higher prices in other locations. This argument is further supported by the statement that "Ghanaâ€™s tradition of artisanal gold mining and the gold price boom which began in 2007 led tens of thousands of Chinese migrants to seek their fortunes in Ghana," indicating that miners may be swayed to where the gold prices are highest. 

2. The prizes from illegal gold digging are not worth the perils anymore. 
This option is ranked second as according to the information given, because of the fall in prices, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold. This combined with destructive environmental effects, possible legal ramifications and potential for violence as indicated in the statements "Illegal gold mining have lead to the killing of some Ghanaian nationals by other nationals due to illegal mining" may dissuade potential illegal miners from continuing with their activities. 

3. This alternative is not proper.
This option is ranked third because it isn't backed up with the provided information, as no details or context is given as to what this alternative entails.

4. Not a single one of the prior options.

5. This is the proper choice.
This option is ranked last as without context or details, this statement doesn't offer a stand-alone proper choice related to the information given.
