1. The advantages of illicitly mining gold no longer compensate for the potential dangers: 

This seems likely given multiple statements in the provided text. The drop in gold prices has made illegal mining less profitable, as stated in the following sentences: "Now, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold" and "Illegal mining has started to decline across the country." Also, the risk associated with illegal mining has been highlighted: "Illegal gold mining have lead to the killing of some Ghanaian nationals by other nationals due to illegal mining." 

2. People involved in unauthorized gold mining are now heading to foreign nations where the gold value remains elevated:

While the text provided no explicit information about miners heading to foreign nations, this claim is plausible given the reduction in gold prices in Ghana. It is, however, ranked lower than the first option as concrete evidence was not presented.

3. Not any of the options listed before:

This answer is ranked third. While some points made in the two options above align with evidence in the text, neither claim is definitively proven. 

4. This possibility is not right / This decision is correct:

These are ranked last as they are too vague and unclear without specifics to compare with the information in the text.
