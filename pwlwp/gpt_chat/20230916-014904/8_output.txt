1. The potential gains from unauthorized gold mining are no longer equitable to the associated risks.

This ranking is based on the data provided in the given sentences which show that the price of gold in Ghana has dramatically dropped due to the discovery of gold in a neighboring country (given question). As a result, illegal miners are now receiving significantly less for a pound of gold. This, in turn, has caused illegal mining to decline across the country, suggesting that the potential gains are no longer worth the associated risks. Furthermore, illegal mining is heavily criticized throughout Ghana due to its detrimental environmental effects (sentence 8). Illegal mining has also been linked to social unrest and the killing of some Ghanaian nationals (sentence 2), indicating high associated risks.

2. None aforementioned.

There is no information provided in the given sentences to support or refute this ranking. Therefore, it is neutral and is ranked second.

3. Across the globe, where gold holds more worth, those who are into illicit gold mining are venturing.

Data in the given sentences does not directly address this ranking. However, it is mentioned that tens of thousands of Chinese migrants were drawn to Ghana, Africaâ€™s second-largest gold producer, due to a gold price boom (sentence 6). Though not directly stated, Chinese miners may have ventured to Ghana due to higher worth of gold there. So, this ranking is placed third.
