    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This option suggests that the lack of change in the number of mining licenses granted could be due to a lack of trust in the government among Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities. Even though the government has made it easier and quicker to obtain a mining license, these individuals may still choose to operate without a license because they do not believe in the government's ability or willingness to enforce the new regulations. This could be due to past experiences of corruption, inefficiency, or unfair treatment by the government. Therefore, despite the reform, they continue their illicit activities, resulting in no increase in the number of mining licenses granted."

    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This option suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses could be due to a lack of awareness about the new, faster licensing process. If Ghanaians who are interested in obtaining a mining license are not aware of the reform, they would not be able to take advantage of it. This could be due to inadequate communication or publicity about the reform by the government. As a result, they continue to operate under the assumption that it takes three years to obtain a license, and thus, the number of licenses granted remains the same."

    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This option suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses could be due to the perception that three months is still too long to obtain a license. Even though the government has significantly reduced the time it takes to get a license, Ghanaians may still view this as a lengthy and cumbersome process. This could be due to the urgency of their financial needs, or the opportunity cost of waiting for three months. Therefore, they continue to engage in illegal mining activities, resulting in no increase in the number of mining licenses granted."

    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This option suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses could be due to two factors. First, Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities may be averse to the risk of taxation that comes with obtaining a license. Even though the government has made it easier to get a license, these individuals may prefer to avoid the financial burden of taxation. Second, Ghanaians who are not involved in illegal mining may have no interest in legal mining, and thus, they do not seek a license. As a result, the number of licenses granted remains the same."

    "rank": 5,
    "justification": "This option suggests that none of the previously mentioned factors are responsible for the unchanged number of mining licenses. This could mean that there are other factors at play that were not mentioned in the options. For example, it could be that the demand for mining licenses was already met before the reform, or that the process of obtaining a license, even though faster, is still too complicated or expensive. Therefore, despite the reform, the number of mining licenses granted remains the same."
