    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This could be a plausible reason for the number of mining licenses remaining the same even after the reform. If the local residents involved in illegal mining have a deep-seated mistrust in the government, they might choose to continue their operations without a license, regardless of the changes in the licensing process. This could be due to past experiences of corruption, inefficiency, or unfair treatment by the government. Therefore, even though the process has been expedited, their lack of faith in the government might prevent them from applying for a license."

    "choice": "Ghanaians aspiring for a license are uninformed about the new, expedited licensing process.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This could also be a potential reason for the unchanged number of mining licenses. If the government has not effectively communicated the changes in the licensing process to the local residents, they might still be under the impression that it takes three years to obtain a license. This lack of information could deter them from applying for a license, resulting in the number of licenses granted remaining the same."

    "choice": "The three-month timeframe for obtaining a mining license is deemed too extensive by Ghanaians.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This could be another possible explanation. Even though the licensing process has been significantly shortened from three years to three months, some local residents might still find this timeframe too long. This could be due to the urgent need for income, the volatile nature of the mining industry, or the bureaucratic hurdles that might still exist within the three-month period. Therefore, they might choose to continue mining illegally rather than waiting for three months to obtain a license."

    "choice": "Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities are not prepared to risk taxation, while those not involved in such activities have no desire for legal mining.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This could be a plausible reason as well. If the local residents involved in illegal mining are not willing to pay taxes, they might choose to continue their operations without a license, despite the expedited licensing process. On the other hand, those not involved in illegal mining might have no interest in legal mining due to the risks, costs, or other factors associated with it. Therefore, the number of licenses granted might remain the same."

    "initial_id": 5,
    "choice": "None of the previously discussed causes are appropriate.",
    "rank": 5,
    "justification": "This option suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses might be due to other reasons not mentioned in the previous choices. These could include factors such as the cost of obtaining a license, the stringent requirements for obtaining a license, the lack of enforcement of mining regulations, or the economic conditions in the country. Therefore, even though the licensing process has been expedited, these other factors might prevent an increase in the number of licenses granted."
