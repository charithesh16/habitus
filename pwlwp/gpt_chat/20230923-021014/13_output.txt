1) "Ghanaians who are involved in illegal mining activities lack trust in the government and would rather proceed without a license."
Justification: This choice suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses granted after the reform could be due to a lack of trust in the government among Ghanaians involved in illegal mining. Even though the government has made it easier and faster to obtain a mining license, these individuals may still prefer to operate without a license due to their distrust in the government. This distrust could stem from past experiences of corruption, inefficiency, or unfair treatment. Therefore, despite the reform, they choose to continue their illegal mining activities without obtaining a license. This choice does not directly cite the context, but it provides a plausible explanation based on the socio-political dynamics that could exist in Ghana.

2) "The new, quickened licensing process is not recognized by Ghanaians who desire a license."
Justification: This choice suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses granted could be due to a lack of awareness or recognition of the new licensing process among Ghanaians who desire a license. Despite the government's efforts to speed up the licensing process, these individuals may not be aware of the changes or may not recognize the new process as legitimate or effective. This could be due to a lack of effective communication from the government about the reform, or due to skepticism about the government's ability to deliver on its promises. This choice does not directly cite the context, but it provides a plausible explanation based on potential communication gaps or skepticism that could exist among Ghanaians.

3) "Ghanaians perceive the three-month duration to obtain a mining license as too prolonged."
Justification: This choice suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses granted could be due to Ghanaians perceiving the new three-month duration to obtain a license as still too long. Even though the government has significantly reduced the time it takes to obtain a license, these individuals may still find the process too slow or cumbersome. This could be due to their urgent need to start mining, or due to their impatience with bureaucratic processes. This choice does not directly cite the context, but it provides a plausible explanation based on potential impatience or urgency that could exist among Ghanaians.

4) "Ghanaians who are involved in illegal mining are not willing to take the risk of being taxed, while those who are not involved in illegal mining are not interested in legal mining."
Justification: This choice suggests that the unchanged number of mining licenses granted could be due to two factors: Ghanaians involved in illegal mining not wanting to risk being taxed, and those not involved in illegal mining not being interested in legal mining. The former group may prefer to avoid the financial burden of taxation, while the latter group may simply not be interested in mining as a livelihood. This choice does not directly cite the context, but it provides a plausible explanation based on potential financial and interest-related factors that could influence Ghanaians' decisions about obtaining a mining license.

5) "None of the earlier mentioned factors are valid."
Justification: This choice suggests that none of the previously mentioned factors accurately explain why the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same after the reform. It implies that the real reason could be something else not mentioned in the other choices. This could include factors such as technical issues with the licensing process, a decrease in the demand for mining due to economic or environmental factors, or a lack of resources or capacity to process more licenses. This choice does not directly cite the context, but it provides a plausible explanation based on the possibility of other unmentioned factors influencing the situation.
