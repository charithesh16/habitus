```The shortened wait time encouraged Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license.```
This choice is plausible because the context suggests that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana. The context states, "The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said." This indicates that the penalties for illegal mining are severe. Therefore, reducing the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could encourage those engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license instead. This is further supported by the context sentence, "There is a fine and imprisonment between 15 and 25 years for each of the following crimes: buying or selling minerals without a license or authority; mining in breach of the law; abetting any breach of the mining law; contracting a non-Ghanaian to provide mining support services; abetting the breach of the mining laws by a foreigner; fabricating or manufacturing floating platforms or other equipment to be used for mining in our water bodies, and providing an excavator for an illegal mining operation." This suggests that the risks associated with illegal mining are high, and a shorter wait time for a legal license could be a strong incentive to transition from illegal to legal mining.

```For Ghanaians who had not been mining before, it is now perceived as a new financial opportunity.```
This choice is also plausible. The context suggests that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, and the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could make it more accessible to those who had not previously considered it. The context states, "Small scale mining license, he said, are only issued to Ghanaians who are 18 years and above, adding that even in such circumstances they are subject to conditions such as a maximum of 1.2 hectares of land allocated to one person or a group of persons not exceeding four (4) in number." This suggests that mining is a viable occupation for Ghanaians, and the reduced wait time could encourage more people to consider it as a financial opportunity.

```The push from their friends or family has influenced Ghanaians to pursue mining licenses.```
This choice is less supported by the context provided. While it is possible that friends or family could influence individuals to pursue mining licenses, the context does not provide any specific information to support this claim. The context focuses more on the legal and regulatory aspects of mining in Ghana, rather than the social or familial influences that might encourage individuals to pursue mining licenses.

```None of the aforementioned factors.```
This choice is unlikely given the context provided. The context suggests that both the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license and the severity of the penalties for illegal mining could be significant factors in the increase in mining license applications. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the aforementioned factors would have contributed to the increase.
