```Due to the reduced waiting period, Ghanaians involved in illegal mining felt more at ease to apply for a license.```
The context provides several indications that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana. For instance, it mentions that "The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers)" and that "Most of the licenses are issued to big companies out of Ghana and that is why everyone is turning to illegal mining." This suggests that many Ghanaians may have been involved in illegal mining due to the difficulty and time-consuming process of obtaining a legal mining license. Therefore, when the government reduced the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months, it is plausible that many of these illegal miners felt more at ease to apply for a license, leading to a tripling of the number of applications.

```It is now seen as a fresh economic prospect by Ghanaians who had not been involved in mining before.```
The context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim. However, it does mention that "Small scale mining license, he said, are only issued to Ghanaians who are 18 years and above" and that "Ghanaians have the right to apply for and obtain licenses to engage in small scale mining." This suggests that mining is an economic activity that is open to all Ghanaians. Therefore, when the government reduced the time it takes to obtain a mining license, it is possible that many Ghanaians who had not been involved in mining before saw it as a fresh economic prospect and decided to apply for a license.

```The encouragement from friends and family has led Ghanaians to apply for mining licenses.```
The context does not provide any evidence to support this claim. It does not mention anything about the role of friends and family in encouraging Ghanaians to apply for mining licenses. Therefore, while it is possible that some Ghanaians may have been encouraged by their friends and family to apply for a mining license, there is no evidence in the context to suggest that this was a significant factor in the tripling of the number of applications.

```None of the previously mentioned reasons.```
This option suggests that none of the previously mentioned reasons are correct. However, as discussed above, the context provides evidence to support the first two reasons: that the reduced waiting period made Ghanaians involved in illegal mining feel more at ease to apply for a license, and that mining is now seen as a fresh economic prospect by Ghanaians who had not been involved in mining before. Therefore, this option is not correct.
