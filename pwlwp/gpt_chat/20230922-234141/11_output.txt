    "choice": "The decrease in wait time made Ghanaians involved in illegal mining more comfortable to apply for a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana, with harsh penalties for those caught engaging in it. For instance, the context sentence \"The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said\" shows the severity of the penalties for illegal mining. Therefore, reducing the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have made those involved in illegal mining more comfortable to apply for a license, as it provides a quicker and legal alternative to their activities."

    "choice": "It is now considered a new economic venture by Ghanaians who were not previously engaged in mining.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that mining licenses are only issued to Ghanaians who are 18 years and above, and that the government is considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small-scale mining. This suggests that mining is a significant economic activity in Ghana. Therefore, reducing the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made mining more attractive to Ghanaians who were not previously engaged in it, as it reduces the barriers to entry into the sector."

    "choice": "The influence of their friends and family has prompted Ghanaians to seek mining licenses.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is less plausible given the context provided. The context sentences do not provide any information about the influence of friends and family on Ghanaians' decisions to seek mining licenses. Therefore, while it is possible that the influence of friends and family could have prompted some Ghanaians to seek mining licenses, there is no evidence in the context sentences to support this claim."

    "choice": "None of the previously stated explanations.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is not plausible given the context provided. The context sentences provide evidence to support the first two choices, as they indicate that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana and that mining is a significant economic activity. Therefore, it is likely that at least one of the previously stated explanations is correct."
