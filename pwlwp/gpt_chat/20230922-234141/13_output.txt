    "choice": "The reduced waiting period made it more appealing for Ghanaians involved in illegal mining to apply for a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible because the context suggests that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana. The context states, \"The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said.\" This indicates that the government is taking serious measures to curb illegal mining. Therefore, reducing the waiting period for obtaining a legal mining license could incentivize those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license instead. This is further supported by the context sentence, \"There is a fine and imprisonment between 15 and 25 years for each of the following crimes: buying or selling minerals without a license or authority; mining in breach of the law; abetting any breach of the mining law; contracting a non-Ghanaian to provide mining support services; abetting the breach of the mining laws by a foreigner; fabricating or manufacturing floating platforms or other equipment to be used for mining in our water bodies, and providing an excavator for an illegal mining operation.\" This suggests that the penalties for illegal mining are severe, making the prospect of obtaining a legal license more appealing."

    "choice": "Ghanaians who were not previously in the mining sector now see it as a new economic opening.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible because the context suggests that mining is a significant industry in Ghana, and the reduction in the waiting period for obtaining a mining license could make it more accessible to those who were not previously involved in the sector. The context states, \"Small scale mining license, he said, are only issued to Ghanaians who are 18 years and above, adding that even in such circumstances they are subject to conditions such as a maximum of 1.2 hectares of land allocated to one person or a group of persons not exceeding four (4) in number.\" This suggests that the government is making efforts to make mining more accessible to Ghanaians, and the reduction in the waiting period could be seen as a new economic opportunity for those who were not previously involved in the sector."

    "choice": "Ghanaians are motivated to obtain mining licenses under the influence of their friends and family.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is less plausible because the context does not provide any information suggesting that Ghanaians are influenced by their friends and family to obtain mining licenses. While it is possible that social influences could play a role in individuals' decisions to apply for a mining license, the context does not provide any evidence to support this claim."

    "initial_id": 4,
    "choice": "None of the earlier mentioned possibilities.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is less plausible because the context provides evidence to support the first two choices. The context suggests that the reduction in the waiting period for obtaining a mining license could make it more appealing for those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license and could be seen as a new economic opportunity for those who were not previously involved in the sector. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the earlier mentioned possibilities would be the reason for the increase in the number of mining license applications."
