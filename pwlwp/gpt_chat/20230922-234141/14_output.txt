```Ghanaians participating in illegal mining were more likely to apply for a license due to the shortened wait time.```
This choice is plausible because the context suggests that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana. The context states, "The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said." This indicates that the government is taking serious measures to curb illegal mining. Therefore, reducing the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could incentivize illegal miners to apply for a license instead. This is further supported by the context sentence, "Most of the licenses are issued to big companies out of Ghana and that is why everyone is turning to illegal mining." This suggests that the lengthy process of obtaining a license may have been a deterrent for local residents, leading them to engage in illegal mining instead.

```It is now seen as a new economic chance by Ghanaians who were not previously mining.```
This choice is also plausible. The context suggests that mining is a significant economic activity in Ghana, and the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could make it more accessible to Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining. The context sentence, "Small scale mining license, he said, are only issued to Ghanaians who are 18 years and above," suggests that mining is an opportunity for economic advancement for Ghanaians. Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a license could encourage more Ghanaians to seek out mining licenses as a new economic opportunity.

```Friends and family have influenced Ghanaians to seek out mining licenses.```
This choice is less plausible because the context does not provide any information about the influence of friends and family on Ghanaians' decisions to seek out mining licenses. While it is possible that friends and family could influence such decisions, the context does not provide any evidence to support this claim.

```None of the previously discussed scenarios.```
This choice is not plausible because the context provides evidence to support the first two scenarios. The context suggests that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana and that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could incentivize illegal miners to apply for a license. The context also suggests that mining is a significant economic activity in Ghana, and the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a license could make it more accessible to Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining. Therefore, it is likely that one or both of these scenarios contributed to the tripling of mining license applications.
