    "choice": "Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining were more inclined to apply for a license due to the reduced waiting period.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible because the context suggests that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana. The context states, 'The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said.' This indicates that the penalties for illegal mining are severe, which could deter individuals from engaging in it. Furthermore, the context mentions, 'The Minerals Commission of Ghana is, however considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small-scale mining to spark an overhaul of the countryâ€™s mining sector and deal with the illegal mining menace.' This suggests that the government is actively trying to combat illegal mining. Therefore, if the time to obtain a legal mining license was reduced from three years to three months, it is likely that individuals who were previously engaged in illegal mining would be more inclined to apply for a license, as it would be a quicker and legal alternative to their current activities."

    "choice": "Ghanaians who had not previously been involved in mining now view it as a novel economic possibility.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible. The context states, 'Small scale mining license, he said, are only issued to Ghanaians who are 18 years and above, adding that even in such circumstances they are subject to conditions such as a maximum of 1.2 hectares of land allocated to one person or a group of persons not exceeding four (4) in number.' This suggests that mining is an economic activity that is accessible to many Ghanaians. Therefore, if the time to obtain a mining license was reduced from three years to three months, it is likely that individuals who had not previously been involved in mining would view it as a novel economic possibility. The reduced waiting period would make it easier for them to enter the mining sector and potentially earn income from it."

    "choice": "Ghanaians have been persuaded to apply for mining licenses due to the influence of their friends and family.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is less plausible because the context does not provide any information about the influence of friends and family on individuals' decisions to apply for mining licenses. While it is possible that friends and family could influence individuals' decisions, there is no evidence in the context to support this claim."

    "choice": "None of the prior stated causes.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is unlikely because the context provides evidence to support the first two choices. As discussed above, the context suggests that the reduction in the time to obtain a mining license could have encouraged individuals who were previously engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license, and it could have made mining a more attractive economic possibility for individuals who had not previously been involved in it. Therefore, it is likely that at least one of the prior stated causes contributed to the tripling of the number of mining license applications."
