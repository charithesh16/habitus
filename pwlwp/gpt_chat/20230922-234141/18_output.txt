```Ghanaians involved in illegal mining felt more confident to apply for a license due to the reduced waiting period.```
This choice is plausible because the context mentions that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana. The context states, "The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said." and "There is a fine and imprisonment between 15 and 25 years for each of the following crimes: buying or selling minerals without a license or authority; mining in breach of the law; abetting any breach of the mining law; contracting a non-Ghanaian to provide mining support services; abetting the breach of the mining laws by a foreigner; fabricating or manufacturing floating platforms or other equipment to be used for mining in our water bodies, and providing an excavator for an illegal mining operation." These statements indicate that illegal mining is a serious crime in Ghana, punishable by hefty fines and long prison sentences. Therefore, if the waiting period for obtaining a legal mining license is reduced, it is likely that those involved in illegal mining would feel more confident to apply for a license, as it would allow them to continue their activities legally and avoid the severe penalties associated with illegal mining.

```For Ghanaians who were not previously mining, it is now seen as a fresh financial opportunity.```
This choice is also plausible because the context suggests that mining is a lucrative activity in Ghana. The context states, "Small scale mining license, he said, are only issued to Ghanaians who are 18 years and above, adding that even in such circumstances they are subject to conditions such as a maximum of 1.2 hectares of land allocated to one person or a group of persons not exceeding four (4) in number." and "â€œWe will make sure we give mining licenses to local Ghanaians." These statements suggest that mining is a profitable activity that is encouraged by the government, and that licenses are readily available to Ghanaians. Therefore, if the waiting period for obtaining a mining license is reduced, it is likely that more Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining would see it as a fresh financial opportunity and apply for a license.

```Ghanaians have been influenced by their friends and family to seek mining licenses.```
This choice is less plausible because the context does not provide any information suggesting that Ghanaians are influenced by their friends and family to seek mining licenses. While it is possible that social influence plays a role in individuals' decisions to seek mining licenses, there is no evidence in the context to support this claim.

```None of the previously mentioned possibilities.```
This choice is unlikely because the context provides evidence to support the first two choices. As explained above, the context suggests that the reduction in the waiting period for obtaining a mining license could encourage those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license and could attract more Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining to see it as a fresh financial opportunity. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the previously mentioned possibilities would be the reason for the tripling of mining license applications.
