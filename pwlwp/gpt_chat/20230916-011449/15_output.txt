1. Farmers will point out that they cannot raise food in runoff from a bauxite mine and predict a consequent food shortage - The given text indicates that, mining of bauxite has negative effects on agricultural lands (A Rocha Ghana's analysis). In addition, strip mining (which is apparently the only way of mining bauxite in Ghana) destroys all vegetation and topsoil (Ghana’s existing bauxite mine at Awaso). Therefore, the assertion that such mining activities could lead to farmers not being able to produce food and thereby leading to a food shortage seems like a plausible outcome.

2. A plan will be devised to transport the bauxite downstream for processing with water that has already been used for agricultural purposes - If water used for agriculture is reused for bauxite mining, it might lead to further pollution with substances such as mercury and arsenic, as indicated by the text (Strip mining is the only way to mine Ghana’s bauxite). The destruction of water bodies due to mining activities is also mentioned as a considerable concern (Mining, especially surface mining results in adverse environmental impacts on water bodies).

3. Yet unrealized and even more valuable uses for clean water will be explored, such as supporting a natural habitat attractive to ecotourism, which is successful in other parts of the country - The Atewa Forest, cited in the context, is a source of water for up to 5 million people and is also home to species that are globally threatened with extinction. While there's no explicit mention of ecotourism in the provided text, this statement aligns with the general tone of concern for the ecological and water resources of the areas, and the suggestion of exploring tourism as an alternative to destructive activities could be seen as a positive step.

4. People will point out that proceeds from the sale of bauxite will more than pay for transport of clean water from elsewhere - The text suggests that the environmental costs of bauxite mining, particularly concerning water resources and agriculture, can outweigh the economic benefits (A Rocha Ghana's analysis). Therefore, using the proceeds from bauxite mining to transport clean water may not be sufficient to address the damages caused by the mining activities.

5. None of the above - This option would be the worst ranking as the other options are using the given information to different extents.
