1. Observers highlight that the profits generated from the commercialization of bauxite could easily cover the costs of conveying fresh water from alternate sources. 
(Supportive information: "This move by the President, the Minister said, is to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, thereby helping to develop the downstream industry to provide employment, enhanced talent development, and to transform the economy." However, it is important to consider that water is a shared resource and needs to be reused multiple times. The destructive consequences of mining are also linked to the use of water in the extraction process.)

2. An approach will be mapped out to transit the bauxite downstream for processing, taking advantage of water reused from farming practices. 
(Supportive information: "Water is a crucial resource in the mining industry, utilized in various activities such as ore processing, dust removal, sludge transportation, and employee supply needs." However, mining activities in Ghana have caused significant environmental damage, particularly to water bodies and land resources.)

3. Farmers are suggesting that bauxite mine runoff is unfit for food cultivation, indicating a potential food scarcity. 
(Supportive information: "Nana Donkoh observed the decision by the government to mine the bauxite in the Atiwa Forest will not only displace thousands of people but cause destruction to water bodies serving as water sources for people in about five regions in the country.")

4. There are yet to be found, more valuable ways of using clean water, for instance, sustaining habitats that attract ecotourism, a thriving business in other parts of the nation. 
(Supportive information: "The activities of illegal miners have led to the destruction of Ghanaâ€™s forest reserves and water bodies." While there are no direct mentions of ecotourism, the importance of preserving habitats and clean water has been emphasized.)
