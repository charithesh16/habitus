1. A scheme will be created to move the bauxite downstream for treatment utilizing water previously used in farming activities.
2. A strategy will be formulated to carry the bauxite downstream for processing using water from prior agricultural use.
3. A proposal is being prepared to shift bauxite downstream for processing with reused agricultural water.
4. A blueprint will be conceived to transport the bauxite towards downstream for processing, using water recycled from agricultural activities.
5. An approach will be mapped out to transit the bauxite downstream for processing, taking advantage of water reused from farming practices.
6. We're devising a plan to convey bauxite downstream for treatment using water that's already served agricultural functions.
7. A method is being primed to deliver bauxite downstream for refinement using water that was previously used agriculturally.
8. Scenarios are being developed to facilitate bauxite movement downstream for processing, utilizing recycled agricultural water.
9. A layout will be drafted to displace bauxite downstream, processed with water that has been recycled from farming.
