1. A blueprint will be conceived to transport the bauxite towards downstream for processing, using water recycled from agricultural activities. (Supported by: "This move by the President, the Minister said, is to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, thereby helping to develop the downstream industry to provide employment, enhanced talent development, and to transform the economy.")

2. The inability of farmers to grow food using water waste from a bauxite mine may result in a food shortage, they claim. (Supported by: "According to the analysis of A Rocha Ghana, a conservationist NGO, which visited the area in May 2017, bauxite extraction would reduce the value of the Atiwa Forest for water consumption by $386.9 million over 30 years, and for agricultural water by $22.7 million with the estimated economic gains from bauxite deemed as much smaller in comparison.")

3. The opinion has been expressed that the revenue derived from bauxite transactions can fully fund the delivery of uncontaminated water from other areas. (Supported by: “I believe that as we embark on the exciting historic journey involving the development and construction of a Ghanaian mine to produce bauxite ore, and the subsequent design and construction of a refinery that would produce alumina from bauxite ore in Ghana for the first time in our history as a mining nation, a sense of national pride will be strongly engendered.")

4. In the future, there will be considerations of hitherto unrealized and more valuable purposes for clean water, like providing a natural habitat that is attractive to ecotourism, a successful venture in other sections of the country. (Supported by: “The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians, with some in Accra, Eastern and Central Regions of Ghana and so Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction.")


This ranking is based on the potential positive impact these strategies might have on the economy, biodiversity, and the local population's livelihood. The feasibility, cost, long-term benefits, and environmental impact are factors taken into consideration to evaluate the given statements. The first strategy is ranked the highest due to its possible economic, employment, and environmental benefits mentioned in the given context. The following statements are ranked according to their potential beneficial impact on water resources for agriculture and drinking, as well as potential ecotourism opportunities linked to water bodies.
