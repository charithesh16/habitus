1. More worthwhile possibilities for the use of clean water remain undiscovered, like the sustenance of natural habitats that are advantageous for ecotourism, a venture that finds success in various other parts of the country. - It's noted frequently in the context provided that water serves a critical role not only in humans' life but also in the sustenance of biodiversity, particularly in the forest habitats, which are being threatened by mining activities (e.g. "The population will fear tainting of their water.", "The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians...Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction."). The mention of ecotourism also aligns with the conservationist sentiments expressed by various NGOs and citizens in the context provided.

2. We're devising a plan to convey bauxite downstream for treatment using water that's already served agricultural functions. - The context above suggests that there's an importance placed on maximizing the use of water in socially and environmentally considerate ways ("Water is a shared resource that does not remain localized and must be used and reused multiple times by groups of people with competing needs and interests."). This careful water management, implied in the above statement, would be seen as a good practice. 

3. According to farmers, the cultivation of food crops in the outflow from a bauxite mine is impossible, leading to anticipated food scarcity. - The context doesn't directly refer to this concern, but it indirectly points to the harmful impacts of mining on agricultural lands ("The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite."), which could potentially lead to food scarcity.

4. Thereâ€™s a belief that the receipts from selling bauxite will be more than sufficient to pay for the carriage of clean water from distant places. - Throughout the context, concerns about water contamination and preservation of water sources heavily outweigh considerations of economic gain. Economic benefits from bauxite mining, such as providing employment and boosting the aluminium industry, are mentioned. However, the emphasis is on the dangers to clean water supplies ("...bauxite extraction would reduce the value of the Atiwa Forest for water consumption by $386.9 million over 30 years..."), suggesting that selling bauxite to fund water transport would not be considered a satisfactory solution.

5. Not any of the above. - This would be the least favorable option, as the provided context offers many concerns and perspectives that are not addressed by simply dismissing all of the above options.
