1. Farmers contend that growing food in the runoff from a bauxite mine is not feasible and warn of a subsequent food shortage. (Based on: "The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite." and "According to the analysis of A Rocha Ghana, a conservationist NGO, which visited the area in May 2017, bauxite extraction would reduce the value of the Atiwa Forest for water consumption by $386.9 million over 30 years, and for agricultural water by $22.7 million.")

2. Various individuals suggest that the financial intake from the sale of bauxite can adequately defray the costs of moving clear water from other locations. (Based on: "This move by the President, the Minister said, is to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, thereby helping to develop the downstream industry to provide employment, enhanced talent development, and to transform the economy.")

3. The unrealised and even more beneficial uses of clean water are waiting to be explored, like preserving a natural habitat that is attractive to ecotourism, a successful venture in various other areas across the country. (Based on: "The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians, with some in Accra, Eastern and Central Regions of Ghana and so Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction." and "The headwaters of the River Offin, a protected area because of the ecosystem services it provides, are in the Tano Offin Forest Reserve and would be threatened as a source of clean water if bauxite mining were to take place there.")

4. A layout will be drafted to displace bauxite downstream, processed with water that has been recycled from farming. (It is not clearly supported by the given information).
