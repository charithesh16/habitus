1. The potential for clean water is still untapped and it holds invaluable applications, including creating a natural habitat conducive to ecotourism, an initiative that has seen success in other regions of the country. 
    - Reasons: The importance of clean water is emphasized throughout the context sentences. Clean water serves as resources for "ore processing, dust removal, sludge transportation, and employee supply needs" in the mining industry, but also for millions of individual and agricultural use. Preservation of clean water sources is also indicated as the determinant of sustainable, economic, and public health development. Furthermore, many times, ecotourism initiatives have been mentioned as better alternatives than destructive mining practices.

2. Farmers warn that they cannot cultivate food from the runoff of a bauxite mine, foreseeing a resulting famine.
    - Reasons: References to the destruction of fertile agricultural lands due to bauxite mining and strip mining practices are mentioned in the context, clearly indicating that farming activities are negatively affected. Also, it's highlighted that contaminated water can lead to a shortage of water for consumption and agriculture. Specifically, one analysis indicated how bauxite extraction would reduce the agriculture water value significantly. 

3. A scheme will be created to move the bauxite downstream for treatment utilizing water previously used in farming activities.
    - Reasons: Some of the context indicates that mining operations result in effluents like mercury, arsenic, and solid suspensions in water bodies. Therefore, using this water for treating bauxite may pose a risk of introducing contaminants to the refined material. Moreover, it's not mentioned whether the water previously used in farming activities would be sufficient for treating bauxite, considering that mining operations usually require large amounts of water.

4. Some argue that the money earned from selling bauxite is more than enough to offset the cost of shipping clean water from parts.
    - Reasons: The economic gain from bauxite mining is considered as smaller in comparison to the potential value of forest for water and agriculture according to some analyses provided in the context. Moreover, it's said that the government could develop the domestic aluminium industry without targeting bauxite in threatened forest reserves. Thus, this option might not be the best use of financial resources from bauxite mining.

5. None of the previous options.
    - Reasons: Depending on the prioritization in context, this choice can either rank higher or lower. If none of the previous options suffice or provide a sustainable solution to mitigate the harmful impacts of bauxite mining on water resources, this option would rank higher. Otherwise, given that it doesn't generate any direct action or solution, this option would be the last one.
