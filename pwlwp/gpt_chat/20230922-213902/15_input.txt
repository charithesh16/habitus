Read the following question delimited with backticks ``` The destructive consequences of many mining operations are not directly related to the local disappearance of the mined material, but to the use of water in the extraction process.  Water is a shared resource that does not remain localized and must be used and reused multiple times by groups of people with competing needs and interests. In Ghana, deposits of minerals like bauxite are sometimes located in forested, mountainous areas which are sources of clean water for large populations.  The population will fear tainting of their water. Suggested construction of a bauxite mine in such a location is most likely to provoke what kind of reaction: ```. Use the following context sentences delimited with backticks as background knowledge ``` A clear example of the destruction that is caused to forests by bauxite mining is Ghana’s existing bauxite mine at Awaso in the Western Region, now a desert of red mud that replaced once thick forest,” he stated.

It said strip mining is the only way to mine Ghana’s bauxite due to its closeness to the surface and notes that this method removes all vegetation, habitats and topsoil, while the rock beneath is then broken up with explosives.

We are not a group against mining bauxite per se, but we are particularly against mining bauxite because of the water provision services.

Nana Donkoh observed the decision by the government to mine the bauxite in the Atiwa Forest will not only displace thousands of people but cause destruction to water bodies serving as water sources for people in about five regions in the country.

Strip mining is the only way to mine Ghana’s bauxite due to its closeness to the surface.

This move by the President, the Minister said, is to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, thereby helping to develop the downstream industry to provide employment, enhanced talent development, and to transform the economy.

The letter to the Attorney-General cites what it says is a clear example of the destruction that is caused to forests by bauxite mining in Ghana’s existing bauxite mine at Awaso in the Western Region, “now a desert of red mud that replaced a once thick forest.

“The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians, with some in Accra, Eastern and Central Regions of Ghana and so Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction.

The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite.

Mining, especially surface mining results in adverse environmental impacts on water bodies (rivers and streams) in Ghana through a release of effluents such as mercury, arsenic and solid suspensions.

Illegal mining activities have also triggered public uproar after reports emerged large portions of Ghana’s vegetation cover and water bodies serving as main sources of domestic water use have been destroyed – with foreigners, politicians, chiefs and security agencies being accused of aiding the illegality.

Activities of illegal small-scale miners have resulted in the pollution of most of the country’s water bodies resulting in the shortage of water in some communities as the Ghana Water Company struggles to treat water for consumption.

Yet bauxite extraction,, gold mining and other activities that destroy the forest are not heeding Dr. Bawumia’s cautions: firstly, sustainability issues have not guided decision making because, if they had, bauxite development in the protected forests and anywhere close to watersheds would have been ruled out long ago; and second, the destruction of Ghana's forests will contribute to the very environmental damage and climate change that he says is a risk to financial stability.

Mining activities in Ghana have raised huge concerns amongst the populace as the menace is now destroying the environment, especially water bodies and land resources.

According to the analysis of A Rocha Ghana, a conservationist NGO, which visited the area in May 2017, bauxite extraction would reduce the value of the Atiwa Forest for water consumption by $386.9 million over 30 years, and for agricultural water by $22.7 million with the estimated economic gains from bauxite deemed as much smaller in comparison.

He indicated that with mineral mining not being a crime in Ghana, miners cannot be told to never mine again because their activities are destroying water bodies.

The Environmental NGO statement again urged government and GIADEC to exclude bauxite in the Atewa Forest as part of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Industry because Ghana’s integrated aluminium industry can thrive without targeting the bauxite at Atewa Forest, “Ghana has both a ban on mining in Forest Reserves and mining guidelines that exclude Atewa from these developments.

He said the three new mines, together with the existing one operated by the Ghana Bauxite Company, are expected to produce ten to twenty million tonnes of bauxite annually, of which approximately half will be refined in Ghana.

“I believe that as we embark on the exciting historic journey involving the development and construction of a Ghanaian mine to produce bauxite ore, and the subsequent design and construction of a refinery that would produce alumina from bauxite ore in Ghana for the first time in our history as a mining nation, a sense of national pride will be strongly engendered.

“It is time to mine the bauxite here and plans are far advanced for us to mine the bauxite so that the people of Kyebi and Ghanaians, in general, would have employment which would generate income for them,” he emphasized.

Illegal mining in Ghana has led to the destruction of several forest reserves and water bodies across the country despite various efforts by the government to clamp down on the menace.

A series of pictures and videos sent to GhanaWeb by concerned residents showed that water bodies in Banaso and Adjeikrom have become polluted due to the illegal mining.

“According to the Water Resource Commission, illegal mining activities have resulted in the pollution of 60 percent of all water bodies in Ghana.

QUOTE: “Illegal mining has caused terrible destruction to water and land in Ghana and appropriate measures must be put in place to deal with it.

These illegal small scale mining results in adverse environmental impacts on water bodies (rivers and streams) in Ghana through a release of effluents such as mercury, arsenic and solid suspensions.

He said the activities of illegal mining had resulted in the formation of sinkholes, contamination of soil, ground and surface water pollution, and loss of biodiversity, thus affected the environment and human life, and stressed that “Ghana cannot look on unconcerned while the water bodies are contaminated to risk the inherent health hazards.

Irresponsible small-scale mining activities across mining communities in Ghana continue to have adverse impacts on lands and water resources and threaten human survival in mining areas.

It must be mentioned that, all the five (5) major bauxite mines in Australia are not happening in a watershed that is the source of water for the citizenry.

Water is a crucial resource in the mining industry, utilized in various activities such as ore processing, dust removal, sludge transportation, and employee supply needs.

The activities of illegal miners have led to the destruction of Ghana’s forest reserves and water bodies.

“Aside the destruction of green vegetation in Awaso, their water bodies were adversely affected due to the bauxite mining.

We urge the Ghana Chamber of Mines, the government and all stakeholders including the citizens to think of better ways to help solve this menace; otherwise we will wake up one day to find out that we do not have any potable water because all the water bodies, as well as our ground water, have been polluted through the unbridled activities of these illegal miners.

To bolster the fight against illegal mining, which has become a national canker and raised serious concerns about pollution of rivers in mining areas, a new mineral processing technology has been introduced by a Ghanaian company to promote sustainable mining.

President Nana Akufo-Addo has assured Ghanaians that the mining of bauxite in the Atewa forest will be guided by best international practices and technology to ensure that the wildlife in the mining environment is not endangered.

The Rush for Gold through illegal gold mining has led to the destruction of majority of water bodies in Ghana leading to the increase in morbidity across all regions selected for this study.

According to the statement, there has been about 12 attempts to mine the bauxite in Atewa, but on all these occasions considerations of negative impact on water, health and well-being led to the abrogation of such plans, “Alcoa a bauxite mining company with huge presence in Australia is one of the many companies that understood and appreciated the water services and decided to back out of the Atewa mine interest.

A Rocha Ghana and 10 other plaintiffs are challenging the government’s move to mine bauxite in the Atewa Range Forest contending that the government is undertaking mining activities in the Forest without mineral rights.

Head of Public Affairs at the Ghana Cocoa Board, Fiifi Boafo, says illegal mining activities in water bodies have compelled cocoa farmers to transport water from home to their various farms for use.

The country’s water bodies and lands are destroyed as a result of illegal mining activities.

The headwaters of the River Offin, a protected area because of the ecosystem services it provides, are in the Tano Offin Forest Reserve and would be threatened as a source of clean water if bauxite mining were to take place there.

The plaintiffs contend that strip mining, the only way to mine Ghana’s bauxite could result in loss of forest cover, loss of biodiversity, loss of access to clean water, a build-up of greenhouse gases, loss of climate amelioration services, loss of emission reduction services, loss of medicinal/economic valuable plants and change in the tourism potential of the area.

It was as a result of the degradation the mining activities were causing the environment especially the contamination of the country’s major water bodies.

Unregulated small scale mining by both local and foreign nationals had caused massive destruction to Ghana’s environment, especially water bodies and forest reserves.

Though it seems the forest is under a threat because Bauxite, typically found in the topsoil is extracted through strip mining, which requires removing layers of soil and rock to access the minerals below.

The country's water bodies and lands are destroyed as a result of illegal mining activities.

Gold mining has always been a part of Ghana but in the last several years, however, largely unregulated galamsey mining resulted in contaminated water bodies which serve various communities.

The phenomenon led to the pollution of the Birim River and other river bodies which used to be a major source of drinking water for millions of Ghanaians.

The illegal mining called galamsey has resulted in serious degradation of vegetation, and lands and pollutes major water bodies this unwelcome issue of land and water pollution in Ghana is of great concern due to the alarming rate at which our beloved arable lands for farming and drinking water for our communities are being destroyed by this irresponsible activities.

Millions of Ghanaians could lose access to treated water due to the impending closure of three major water treatment dams due to the activities of illegal mining, according to the Ministry of Water Resources, Works and Housing.

Water is also one of the most essential elements of the human environment and as we are all aware, water resources generate development in socio-economic issues which is crucial to the society in general and more specifically for industries and public consumption in our country Ghana.

By the Ghana Mining Policy 2014 year, Ghana has a huge amount of minerals within its borders, from gold to diamonds, which are important natural resources for the global economy.

Lots of lives have been lost due to illegal mining in Ghana. ```.
      Provide long and thorough justifications for each of the choices independently, without referring to the other choices, while citing the context using quotes.:
	```The earnings from the sale of bauxite, as people will point out, will more than cover the cost of bringing clean water from other sources.
Yet to be discovered and potentially more valuable uses for clean water will be explored, like supporting a natural habitat that appeals to ecotourism, a strategy that has been successful in other regions of the country.
Farmers will probably argue that they can't raise food in the runoff from a bauxite mine, and foresee a resulting food scarcity.
A plan is being designed to carry the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has been previously used in agriculture.
None of the options mentioned above.```
