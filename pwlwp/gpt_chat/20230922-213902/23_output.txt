```People will point out that proceeds from the sale of bauxite will more than pay for transport of clean water from elsewhere.```
This choice is plausible as it suggests that the revenue generated from bauxite mining could be used to fund the transportation of clean water from other sources. However, the context sentences indicate that the environmental and social costs of mining, particularly the destruction of water bodies and forests, are of significant concern to the local population. For instance, one context sentence states, "Nana Donkoh observed the decision by the government to mine the bauxite in the Atiwa Forest will not only displace thousands of people but cause destruction to water bodies serving as water sources for people in about five regions in the country." This suggests that the local population may not view the potential financial benefits of mining as outweighing the environmental and social costs.

```Yet unrealized and even more valuable uses for clean water will be explored, such as supporting a natural habitat attractive to ecotourism, which is successful in other parts of the country.```
This choice is plausible as it suggests that the local population may advocate for the preservation of clean water sources for potential future uses, such as ecotourism. The context sentences indicate that the destruction of water bodies and forests due to mining is a significant concern. For example, one context sentence states, "The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians, with some in Accra, Eastern and Central Regions of Ghana and so Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction." This suggests that the local population may value the preservation of natural habitats and clean water sources for their potential ecological and economic benefits.

```Farmers will point out that they cannot raise food in runoff from a bauxite mine and predict a consequent food shortage.```
This choice is plausible as it suggests that farmers may express concerns about the potential impact of mining on agricultural productivity. The context sentences indicate that the destruction of water bodies and forests due to mining is a significant concern, and that this could potentially impact agricultural activities. For instance, one context sentence states, "The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite." This suggests that farmers may be concerned about the potential impact of mining on their ability to raise crops and the potential for a consequent food shortage.

```A plan will be devised to transport the bauxite downstream for processing with water that has already been used for agricultural purposes.```
This choice is plausible as it suggests a potential solution to the problem of water usage in mining. However, the context sentences indicate that the local population is primarily concerned with the destruction of water bodies and forests due to mining, rather than the specific methods of water usage in mining. For example, one context sentence states, "Mining, especially surface mining results in adverse environmental impacts on water bodies (rivers and streams) in Ghana through a release of effluents such as mercury, arsenic and solid suspensions." This suggests that the local population may be more concerned with the overall environmental impact of mining, rather than the specific methods of water usage in mining.

```None of the above.```
This choice is plausible as it suggests that none of the other choices accurately reflect the likely reaction of the local population to the proposed bauxite mine. The context sentences indicate that the local population is primarily concerned with the destruction of water bodies and forests due to mining. For instance, one context sentence states, "The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians, with some in Accra, Eastern and Central Regions of Ghana and so Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction." This suggests that the local population may be more concerned with the overall environmental impact of mining, rather than the specific methods of water usage in mining or the potential financial benefits of mining.
