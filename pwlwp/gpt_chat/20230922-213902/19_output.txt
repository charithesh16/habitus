Choice 1: "It will be underscored by people that the revenue from bauxite sales will more than compensate for the cost of procuring clean water from other places."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that the revenue generated from bauxite mining could be used to offset the cost of procuring clean water from other sources. However, the context sentences do not provide any direct evidence to support this claim. The context sentences do mention that bauxite mining is a significant economic activity in Ghana, with the Minister stating that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, helping to develop the downstream industry, provide employment, enhance talent development, and transform the economy. However, there is no specific mention of using the revenue from bauxite sales to compensate for the cost of procuring clean water from other places.

Choice 2: "There are still unexplored and potentially more valuable uses for clean water, like fostering a natural habitat that is appealing to ecotourism, which has proven successful in other areas of the country."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that clean water could be used for other potentially more valuable purposes, such as fostering a natural habitat for ecotourism. The context sentences do mention that water is a crucial resource in the mining industry and that water bodies in Ghana have been destroyed due to mining activities. However, there is no specific mention of using clean water for ecotourism or any evidence to suggest that ecotourism has proven successful in other areas of the country.

Choice 3: "It's expected that farmers will highlight their inability to farm food in the runoff from a bauxite mine, and predict a following food shortage."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that farmers could be affected by the runoff from a bauxite mine, potentially leading to a food shortage. The context sentences do mention that mining activities in Ghana have raised huge concerns amongst the populace as the menace is now destroying the environment, especially water bodies and land resources. However, there is no specific mention of farmers highlighting their inability to farm food in the runoff from a bauxite mine or predicting a following food shortage.

Choice 4: "A plan is in the works to transport the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has already been used for farming."

Justification: This choice is not supported by the context sentences. While the context sentences do mention that water is a crucial resource in the mining industry, utilized in various activities such as ore processing, dust removal, sludge transportation, and employee supply needs, there is no specific mention of a plan to transport the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has already been used for farming.

Choice 5: "None of the options stated above."

Justification: This choice is plausible as none of the previous choices are directly supported by the context sentences. While the context sentences do provide information about the impact of bauxite mining on the environment and water resources in Ghana, they do not provide specific evidence to support the claims made in the previous choices.
