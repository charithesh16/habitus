1. A strategy will be formulated to move the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has previously been utilized for agricultural activities.
2. We will devise a plan to transport the bauxite downstream for processing using water already used in agriculture.
3. A scheme will be developed to convey the bauxite downstream for processing with water previously used for farming.
4. A blueprint will be created to shift the bauxite downstream for processing with water that was earlier used for agricultural needs.
5. A proposal will be put forward to transfer the bauxite downstream for processing with water that has been used for agricultural tasks before.
6. A plan is being designed to carry the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has been previously used in agriculture.
7. A strategy is being planned to move the bauxite downstream for processing with water that has been used earlier for agricultural purposes.
8. A plan is in the works to transport the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has already been used for farming.
