Choice 1: "The earnings from the sale of bauxite, as people will point out, will more than cover the cost of bringing clean water from other sources."

Justification: This choice is plausible as the context suggests that bauxite mining is a significant economic activity in Ghana. The Minister mentioned that the President's move to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana is aimed at developing the downstream industry to provide employment, enhance talent development, and transform the economy. However, the context also highlights the destructive consequences of bauxite mining on water resources. For instance, it is stated that "Mining, especially surface mining results in adverse environmental impacts on water bodies (rivers and streams) in Ghana through a release of effluents such as mercury, arsenic and solid suspensions." Therefore, while the earnings from bauxite mining could potentially cover the cost of sourcing clean water from other areas, the environmental impact and potential health risks associated with the mining process could provoke a negative reaction from the local population.

Choice 2: "Yet to be discovered and potentially more valuable uses for clean water will be explored, like supporting a natural habitat that appeals to ecotourism, a strategy that has been successful in other regions of the country."

Justification: This choice is plausible as the context suggests that clean water is a valuable resource that supports various ecosystems and human activities. For instance, it is stated that "The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians, with some in Accra, Eastern and Central Regions of Ghana and so Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction." Therefore, the potential for discovering more valuable uses for clean water, such as supporting natural habitats for ecotourism, could provoke a positive reaction from the local population and conservationists. However, the destructive consequences of bauxite mining on water resources could also provoke a negative reaction.

Choice 3: "Farmers will probably argue that they can't raise food in the runoff from a bauxite mine, and foresee a resulting food scarcity."

Justification: This choice is plausible as the context suggests that bauxite mining has adverse impacts on agricultural activities. For instance, it is stated that "The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite." Therefore, farmers could argue that they cannot raise food in the runoff from a bauxite mine due to the potential contamination of water and soil, which could lead to food scarcity. This could provoke a negative reaction from the local population, particularly farmers and those dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.

Choice 4: "A plan is being designed to carry the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has been previously used in agriculture."

Justification: This choice is plausible as the context suggests that water is a crucial resource in the mining industry, utilized in various activities such as ore processing, dust removal, sludge transportation, and employee supply needs. However, the context also highlights the destructive consequences of bauxite mining on water resources. For instance, it is stated that "Mining, especially surface mining results in adverse environmental impacts on water bodies (rivers and streams) in Ghana through a release of effluents such as mercury, arsenic and solid suspensions." Therefore, while a plan to carry the bauxite downstream for processing using water previously used in agriculture could potentially mitigate the impact on fresh water resources, the potential contamination of the water could still provoke a negative reaction from the local population.

Choice 5: "None of the options mentioned above."

Justification: This choice is plausible if the local population's reaction to the proposed bauxite mining operation is not adequately captured by the other options. The context suggests that the local population has diverse concerns about bauxite mining, including its impact on water resources, agriculture, and the environment. Therefore, their reaction could involve a combination of the concerns highlighted in the other options or other concerns not mentioned in these options. For instance, the context mentions that "Illegal mining activities have also triggered public uproar after reports emerged large portions of Ghana’s vegetation cover and water bodies serving as main sources of domestic water use have been destroyed – with foreigners, politicians, chiefs and security agencies being accused of aiding the illegality." This suggests that the local population's reaction could also involve concerns about the legality and governance of the mining operation.
