Choice 1: "It will be pointed out by people that the sale of bauxite will cover the cost of transporting clean water from other places."

Justification: This choice is plausible given the context. The extraction of bauxite is a lucrative activity that could potentially generate significant revenue. As stated in the context, "This move by the President, the Minister said, is to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, thereby helping to develop the downstream industry to provide employment, enhanced talent development, and to transform the economy." However, the context also highlights the destructive consequences of bauxite mining on water resources. For instance, "Mining, especially surface mining results in adverse environmental impacts on water bodies (rivers and streams) in Ghana through a release of effluents such as mercury, arsenic and solid suspensions." Therefore, it is conceivable that some people might argue that the profits from bauxite sales could be used to offset the costs of transporting clean water from other places to compensate for the local water pollution caused by mining.

Choice 2: "Clean water could be used for yet unrealized and even more valuable purposes, such as supporting a natural habitat that attracts ecotourism, a successful venture in other parts of the country."

Justification: This choice is also plausible given the context. The context emphasizes the importance of clean water not only for human consumption but also for maintaining biodiversity and supporting ecosystems. For example, "The Atewa Forest is the source of water for up to 5 million Ghanaians, with some in Accra, Eastern and Central Regions of Ghana and so Bauxite mining in the Forest would greatly endanger the water provisioning services and the large number of species in the forest that are already globally threatened with extinction." Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that clean water could be used for other valuable purposes such as supporting natural habitats that attract ecotourism, which could be a more sustainable and less destructive alternative to mining.

Choice 3: "Farmers are likely to argue that they can't grow crops with the runoff from a bauxite mine, leading to a potential food shortage."

Justification: This choice is highly plausible given the context. The context indicates that bauxite mining has detrimental effects on agricultural lands. For instance, "The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite." Therefore, it is likely that farmers would argue against bauxite mining due to the potential harm it could cause to their crops and the subsequent risk of food shortages.

Choice 4: "A strategy will be formulated to move the bauxite downstream for processing using water that has previously been utilized for agricultural activities."

Justification: This choice is less plausible given the context. While the context does mention the use of water in the extraction process of bauxite, it does not provide any information about the feasibility or desirability of using water that has previously been used for agricultural activities for this purpose. Moreover, the context highlights the destructive consequences of bauxite mining on water resources, suggesting that any strategy involving the use of water for mining would likely be met with resistance.

Choice 5: "None of the options provided above."

Justification: This choice is not plausible given the context. The context provides ample evidence to support the plausibility of the first three choices. The fourth choice is less plausible, but it is not entirely implausible. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that none of the options provided above are plausible given the context.
