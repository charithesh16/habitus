Choice 1: "People will highlight that the income from the sale of bauxite will more than offset the cost of transporting clean water from other regions."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that the income generated from bauxite mining could be used to mitigate the negative impacts on water resources. However, the context sentences do not provide any direct evidence to support this claim. The context does mention that the government aims to refine bauxite in Ghana to develop the downstream industry and transform the economy ("This move by the President, the Minister said, is to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, thereby helping to develop the downstream industry to provide employment, enhanced talent development, and to transform the economy."). However, there is no mention of using the income from bauxite sales to offset the cost of transporting clean water from other regions.

Choice 2: "Yet to be realized and potentially more valuable uses for clean water will be examined, such as supporting a natural habitat that is attractive to ecotourism, a concept that has worked in other parts of the country."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that clean water could be used for ecotourism, which could potentially be more valuable than bauxite mining. However, the context sentences do not provide any direct evidence to support this claim. The context does mention that mining activities have resulted in the destruction of forests and water bodies, which could potentially impact ecotourism ("The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite."). However, there is no mention of examining potentially more valuable uses for clean water, such as supporting a natural habitat for ecotourism.

Choice 3: "Farmers will likely underline that they can't produce food using the runoff from a bauxite mine, and foresee a subsequent food scarcity."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that farmers could be concerned about the impact of bauxite mining on their ability to produce food. The context sentences provide evidence to support this claim. The context mentions that mining activities have resulted in the destruction of fertile agricultural lands ("The organization has observed that water for five million people sourced from River Densu, Ayensu and Birim, fertile agricultural lands for cocoa and food production will be destroyed if the forest is mined for bauxite."). This could potentially lead to food scarcity if farmers are unable to produce food using the runoff from a bauxite mine.

Choice 4: "A plan is being formulated to shift the bauxite downstream for processing with water that has been previously used for agricultural activities."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that a plan could be formulated to mitigate the impact of bauxite mining on water resources. However, the context sentences do not provide any direct evidence to support this claim. The context does mention that the government aims to refine bauxite in Ghana ("This move by the President, the Minister said, is to ensure that bauxite mined in Ghana is refined in Ghana, thereby helping to develop the downstream industry to provide employment, enhanced talent development, and to transform the economy."). However, there is no mention of a plan being formulated to shift the bauxite downstream for processing with water that has been previously used for agricultural activities.

Choice 5: "None of the options that were mentioned above."

Justification: This choice is plausible as it suggests that none of the other choices accurately reflect the likely reaction to the proposed bauxite mine. The context sentences provide evidence to support this claim. The context mentions that mining activities have resulted in the destruction of forests and water bodies, and have raised concerns among the populace ("Mining activities in Ghana have raised huge concerns amongst the populace as the menace is now destroying the environment, especially water bodies and land resources."). This suggests that the likely reaction to the proposed bauxite mine would be opposition and concern, rather than the reactions suggested in the other choices.
