    "choice": "Ghanaians participating in illegal mining activities do not believe in the government and would rather proceed without a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the fact that illegal mining has been a persistent issue in Ghana, despite the government's efforts to regulate the sector. The context sentences mention that 'The Ghanaian government has taken the issue of illegal mining seriously because apart from the impact on our economy, its impact on the environment is dire.' and 'The main issue in Ghana has been illegal mining, which has been difficult to combat since the law makes it difficult to bring perpetrators to justice and, more crucially, because those in positions of authority sometimes participate in the malpractices.' These statements suggest that there is a lack of trust in the government's ability to manage the mining sector effectively, which could lead to Ghanaians preferring to continue with illegal mining activities without obtaining a license."

    "choice": "Ghanaians aspiring for a license are uninformed about the new, accelerated licensing process.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the fact that the reform is relatively new and information about it might not have reached all potential licensees yet. The context sentences do not provide direct evidence for this, but it is a plausible explanation given that the reform was implemented only a month ago. It is also mentioned that 'According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities.' This suggests that there might be a lack of information or understanding about the licensing process among Ghanaians."

    "choice": "Ghanaians perceive the three-month duration to get a mining license as too prolonged.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the fact that the previous process took three years, and while the new process is significantly shorter, it might still be perceived as too long by some Ghanaians. The context sentences do not provide direct evidence for this, but it is a plausible explanation given the urgency and economic necessity that might drive people to engage in mining activities."

    "choice": "Ghanaians involved in illicit mining activities are reluctant to risk taxation, while those not involved in such activities are uninterested in legal mining.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the fact that illegal mining allows individuals to avoid taxation, which might be a significant motivation for some. The context sentences mention that 'The revival of these two mines, the expansion of output by some existing mines, and the reduction of the withholding tax rate on unprocessed gold by small-scale miners, which was introduced in 2015, from three percent (3%) to one and a half percent (1.5%), have contributed significantly to Ghanaâ€™s new position on the continent.' This suggests that taxation is a significant factor in the mining sector, and avoiding it might be a motivation for illegal mining. On the other hand, those not involved in illegal mining might not be interested in legal mining due to the risks and challenges associated with it."

    "choice": "None of the previously discussed factors are responsible.",
    "rank": 5,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified if there are other factors not mentioned in the previous choices that are responsible for the unchanged number of mining licenses granted. The context sentences provide several potential factors, such as the difficulty of obtaining a license, the involvement of foreigners in the mining sector, and the environmental impact of mining. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to determine whether these or other factors are responsible."
