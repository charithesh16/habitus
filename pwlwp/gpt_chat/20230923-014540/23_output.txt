```Ghanaians involved in illegal mining do not trust the government and would prefer to operate without a license```: This could be a plausible reason as the context suggests that there is a significant amount of illegal mining activity in Ghana. The context also indicates that there is a lack of trust in the government's handling of the mining sector. For instance, the context states, "The time has now come for Ghanaian society to seize the moment and end the impunity of the mining sector - in which fraudulently acquired rights resulting from corruption (payments of bribes?" This suggests that there is a perception of corruption and impunity in the mining sector, which could lead to a lack of trust in the government's reforms. Furthermore, the context also mentions that "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." This could indicate that some Ghanaians may prefer to operate without a license due to the perceived difficulties in obtaining one.

```Ghanaians who would like a license are unaware of the new, expedited licensing process```: This could be a possible reason as the context does not provide any information on how the new reforms were communicated to the public. If the reforms were not effectively communicated, it is possible that many Ghanaians who would like a license are unaware of the new, expedited licensing process. The context states, "The move, he said, is to allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner under the five-year multilateral mining integrated project." This suggests that the government's intention is to encourage legal mining, but if the reforms were not effectively communicated, it could explain why the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same.

```Ghanaians think three months is too long to obtain a mining license```: This could be a possible reason, although the context does not provide any direct evidence to support this. The context does suggest that the previous process of obtaining a mining license was lengthy, taking up to three years. However, it does not provide any information on whether Ghanaians consider three months to be too long. The context states, "Instead of three years, they can now do it in three months." This suggests that the government has significantly reduced the time it takes to obtain a mining license, but it does not provide any information on how this change has been received by Ghanaians.

```Ghanaians involved in illegal mining do not want to risk being taxed by authorities, while Ghanaians that are not involved in illegal mining are not interested in legal mining```: This could be a plausible reason as the context suggests that there are significant financial considerations involved in mining. For instance, the context states, "Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts." This suggests that there are significant financial barriers to legal mining, which could discourage Ghanaians from obtaining a license. Furthermore, the context also mentions that "The revival of these two mines, the expansion of output by some existing mines, and the reduction of the withholding tax rate on unprocessed gold by small-scale miners, which was introduced in 2015, from three percent (3%) to one and a half percent (1.5%), have contributed significantly to Ghanaâ€™s new position on the continent." This suggests that taxes are a significant consideration in the mining sector, which could discourage illegal miners from obtaining a license.

```None of the above```: This option cannot be justified as the context provides evidence to support each of the other options.
