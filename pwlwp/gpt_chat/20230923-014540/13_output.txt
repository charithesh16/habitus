```Ghanaians who are involved in illegal mining activities lack trust in the government and would rather carry out their operations without a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a history of mistrust and dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the mining sector. For instance, the context mentions that "The time has now come for Ghanaian society to seize the moment and end the impunity of the mining sector - in which fraudulently acquired rights resulting from corruption (payments of bribes?" This suggests that there is a perception of corruption and unfairness in the sector, which could lead to a lack of trust in the government's reforms. Additionally, the context mentions that "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." This suggests that Ghanaians may feel disadvantaged and may therefore prefer to operate without a license.

```The newly introduced, expedited licensing process is unfamiliar to Ghanaians who desire a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that the mining sector in Ghana has gone through many changes and that these changes may not be well understood by those involved in the sector. For instance, the context mentions that "The sector Minister said because mining in Ghana had gone through many changes since the first Europeans arrived in the country in 1471, there was the need to adjust Ghana’s mining laws and policies to accommodate changing circumstances." This suggests that the changes in the sector, including the expedited licensing process, may be unfamiliar to Ghanaians who desire a license.

```The belief among Ghanaians is that three months is too extended a period to obtain a mining license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that the process of obtaining a mining license in Ghana has traditionally been lengthy and cumbersome. For instance, the context mentions that "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." This suggests that Ghanaians may view the three-month period as still too long, especially when compared to the immediate benefits of illegal mining.

```Ghanaians who are involved in illegal mining activities are not ready to take the risk of being taxed, while those not involved in such activities are not keen on legal mining.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that there are financial disincentives associated with legal mining, such as taxes. For instance, the context mentions that "The revival of these two mines, the expansion of output by some existing mines, and the reduction of the withholding tax rate on unprocessed gold by small-scale miners, which was introduced in 2015, from three percent (3%) to one and a half percent (1.5%), have contributed significantly to Ghana’s new position on the continent." This suggests that taxes may be a deterrent for those involved in illegal mining activities, who may not be ready to take the risk of being taxed.

```None of the earlier mentioned reasons are pertinent.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that there are a multitude of complex factors influencing the mining sector in Ghana, and that none of the earlier mentioned reasons may fully capture these complexities. For instance, the context mentions that "The main issue in Ghana has been illegal mining, which has been difficult to combat since the law makes it difficult to bring perpetrators to justice and, more crucially, because those in positions of authority sometimes participate in the malpractices." This suggests that the reasons for the lack of increase in mining licenses granted may be more complex and multifaceted than the earlier mentioned reasons suggest.
