1. The reward of illegal gold drilling no longer validates the peril. 

This statement is ranked first because it aligns with the context provided which illustrates the decreased income illegal miners receive for a pound of gold, falling from $420 to $200 (Source: Context). Other contexts also indicate the environmental and social issues, as well as the legal consequences that illicit mining causes (Source: Detrimental effects of illegal mining, deportation of illegal miners). 

2. Those participating in the unauthorized mining of gold are now shifting abroad, where the cost for gold holds a higher evaluation. 

This statement is ranked second as it aligns with the decrease in the price of gold in the Ghanaian market. It may imply that illegal miners choose to operate in other countries where the price of gold is higher. However, the context does not directly provide evidence for this migration. 

3. This choice is the accurate one.

This statement is vague and lacks direct reference to any given context or situation. It is ranked third because more specific elaboration or context is required to decode its merit. 

4. None among the above stated.

This statement is ranked fourth as it contradicts the first two ranked statements which are derived from the context provided. 

5. This resolution is not proper. 

This statement is placed last due to its lack of specificity. Without knowledge of the exact "resolution" being referred to, it is difficult to examine its applicability.
