1. The potential return from illegal gold mining does not warrant the risk anymore.

This option seems to be the most supported by the information given. Prices for illegal gold mining have plummeted from $420 to $200 per pound, thereby significantly reducing profitability (Given: "Now, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold.") Furthermore, illegal mining is heavily criticized due to its detrimental environmental effects, which potentially outweigh economic justifications (Given: "Illegal gold mining operations are criticised heavily throughout Ghana due to their detrimental environmental effects, which many believe outweigh any possible economic and cultural justifications.") Also, illegal miners face risk of arrest and detainment, as evidenced by the 2013 arrest of 168 Chinese nationals on suspicion of illegal gold mining (Given: "In 2013, the Ghanaian government arrested 168 Chinese nationals on suspicion of illegal gold mining, following reports of environmental devastation and social unrest.")

2. The people who are active in illegal gold excavation are presently relocating to overseas regions, where the gold price is still top-notch.

There is no direct information given to support this statement. It was mentioned that Ghana's tradition of artisanal gold mining and the boom in gold prices led Chinese migrants to Ghana, but there was no indication that illegal miners are currently relocating to other regions due to decreasing gold prices (Given: "Ghanaâ€™s tradition of artisanal gold mining and the gold price boom which began in 2007 led tens of thousands of Chinese migrants to seek their fortunes in Ghana.") 

3. The selected option is not right.

This statement is not applicable as there is no selected option mentioned in the given context.

4. No one from the preceding options.

If we assume that none of the aforementioned statements are accurate or strongly supported by the information given, then this option could potentially hold. However, evidence found within the given texts does support option 1. 

5. This decision is the most suitable one.

There is no specific decision being referenced or discussed in the given information; as such this statement cannot be ranked accurately.
