It is mentioned that due to the discovery of gold in a neighboring country, prices for gold have plummeted in Ghana, with illegal miners now only receiving $200 for a pound of gold (Ref: "illegal miners are receiving $200 for a pound of gold"). This is seen as a reason for the decline of illegal mining activities in the country (Ref: "Illegal mining has started to decline across the country"). Additionally, the dangers of illegal gold mining are emphasized, with it being noted that illegal operations have led to killings (Ref: "Illegal gold mining have lead to the killing of some Ghanaian nationals").
