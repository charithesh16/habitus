1. The risk connected with illegal gold prospecting now exceeds its reward.
   - The decrease in prices for illegal gold mining can be seen as an increase in risk for the miners. As stated, "Now, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold. Illegal mining has started to decline across the country" (source).

2. Those who are participating in illicit gold extraction are now transitioning abroad, where gold's worth continues to be greater.
   - The information provided does not give explicit evidence of this. However, it can be indirectly inferred that reduction in profits within the country may push illegal miners to seek better opportunities abroad where the price of gold may be higher.

3. Zero from the prior list.
   - The information provided does not rule out the above alternatives but rather supports them to some extent.

Note: The alternative "This alternative isn't accurate" is not a valid option as it doesn't qualify as a possibility but rather an opinion on the validity of the other items in the list.
