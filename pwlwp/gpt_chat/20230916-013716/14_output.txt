The best to worst ranking would be: 

1. The payoff of illegal gold mining no longer justifies the risk. 

Citations: 
- The discovery of gold in a neighboring country has caused the price of gold to drop significantly in Ghana, reducing the profits that illegal miners can make from selling gold. This reduced reward, coupled with the risks and consequences associated with illegal mining (as seen in reports about their detrimental environmental effects and violence related to illegal mining), may have led illegal miners to rethink their activities. 
- "In the current Ghanaian market, a pound of gold is worth $30,000. However, an illegal gold miner sells it for about $420. Imagine that gold is discovered in a neighboring country in even greater quantities, shifting the mining industry and causing prices to plummet in Ghana. Now, illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold."

2. Those involved in illegal gold mining are now moving abroad, where the value of gold is still higher.

Citations: 
- The significant drop in the price of gold in Ghana may have caused some illegal miners to seek opportunities abroad, where gold might still fetch higher prices. However, it is important to note that the provided texts do not give explicit mention or evidence to this effect.
