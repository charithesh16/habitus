1. The risk involved in illicit gold mining now surpasses the potential gain.
   This statement is likely the best based on the information provided. After the discovery of gold in a neighboring country, the prices of gold in Ghana plummeted. Now, illegal miners are receiving significantly less money for their gold ($200 per pound), which likely does not equate to the potential risk and damage associated with illegal mining. Many sources cited highlighted the detrimental environmental impacts, social unrest, and health risks linked to illegal mining. These adverse effects may outweigh the potential financial gain, especially given the reduced return on illegal gold. (sources: main question, "Illegal gold mining operations are criticised...," "The Rush for Gold through illegal gold mining...," and "It is important to note...").

2. The people implicated in prohibited gold mining are presently shifting to other countries where the cost of gold remains more substantial.
   This statement could be plausible but isn't as strong as the first one. There is no direct information given to support that illegal miners are moving to other countries. However, the reduction in gold prices and subsequent decline in illegal mining could suggest that these miners are seeking regions with more favorable prices (source: main question).

3. This is the accurate decision.
   The information provided does not specify what "this decision" refers to, so it's difficult to rank accurately. However, the various measures and policy changes described to regulate the gold mining sector and tackle illegal mining in Ghana seem to be responding accordingly to the situation (sources: "Ghana, Africa’s second-largest gold producer...," "Addressing participants at a national stakeholders’ workshop...," "In 2013, the Ghanaian government arrested...").

4. This decision isn't right.
   Just like the prior statement, there's not enough context to understand what "this decision" refers to. The accounts shared in the information suggest Ghana is making various efforts to manage the illegal mining problem and benefit from its large gold resources. Challenges still exist, but it's unclear to which decision this statement is related.

5. Not one of the aforementioned.
   This statement doesn't provide any concrete information or viewpoint based on the given context and facts. Therefore, it is ranked as the worst.
