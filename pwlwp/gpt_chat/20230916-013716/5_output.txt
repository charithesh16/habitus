1. The rewards from unlawful gold extraction no longer outweigh the hazards.
This is supported by the text highlighting the significant drop in prices illegal miners are getting for gold due to increased gold discovery in neighboring countries. Additionally, the text discusses the negative environmental effects, social unrest, and potential for danger involved in illegal mining. For example, "Illegal mining has started to decline across the country..." and "Illegal gold mining operations are criticised heavily throughout Ghana due to their detrimental environmental effects."

2. Not any from the previous list. 
This represents a neutral position where there is insufficient information to definitively support the statement. 

3. Illegal gold miners are now migrating to foreign lands where the price of gold is considerably elevated.
Although the text suggests that the price of gold has gone down in Ghana, which could theoretically drive miners to migrate elsewhere, there are no statements within the given context that directly confirm illegal miners are migrating to foreign lands where gold prices are higher. Thus, it is placed the last in this ranking.
