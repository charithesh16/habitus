1. The gain from unlawful gold mining is no longer equivalent to the risks attached.

The statements provide evidence of the risks associated with illegal gold mining and the decreased profit it now offers. This can be seen where it is mentioned that "Illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold" compared to the previous $420. The also stated that "Illegal mining has started to decline across the country." These factors indicate a higher level of risk when compared to the financial gain from unlawful mining (Refer to: "Illegal gold mining has lead to the killing of some Ghanaian nationals by other nationals due to illegal mining", "The Rush for Gold through illegal gold mining has led to the destruction of majority of water bodies in Ghana leading to the increase in morbidity across all regions selected for this study" etc.)

2. Participants in illicit gold mining are now migrating internationally, where the monetary worth of gold maintains a higher status.

There is evidence from the information provided that suggests international migration due to dwindling profits from illegal gold mining in Ghana. It mentioned that the "Ghanaian tradition of artisanal gold mining and the gold price boom which began in 2007 led tens of thousands of Chinese migrants to seek their fortunes in Ghana." However, it didn't specify whether these miners migrated due to the reduced price of gold in Ghana specifically. (Refer to: "Ghanaâ€™s tradition of artisanal gold mining and the gold price boom which began in 2007 led tens of thousands of Chinese migrants to seek their fortunes in Ghana").

5. None from the foregoing.
