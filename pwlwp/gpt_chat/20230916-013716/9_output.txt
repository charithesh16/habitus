1. Those partaking in unlawful gold mining operations are now heading abroad where the price of gold holds a higher value. 
Ranking reason: Due to the situation in Ghana with the price of gold plummeting, it's possible that illegal miners are seeking opportunities abroad where the price of gold retains a higher value. According to the provided context, it is stated that, "Large quantities of gold illegally smuggled to neighbouring countries without documentation, thus creating a huge revenue shortfall for Ghana". This suggests a possible trend of miners seeking more profitable markets.

2. The potential earnings from illegal gold mining no longer balance out the danger.
Ranking reason: Decreased profits from illegal gold mining could be a major deterrent for miners. The text states "illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold", a significant drop from previous rates. Coupled with the serious dangers mentioned - including killings related to illegal mining, environmental devastation and societal unrest - it could be inferred that the risks of illegal gold mining may now outweigh the financial benefits.

3. Not a single one stated before.
Ranking reason: Although not specifically stated in the provided text, other options or possibilities could exist given the complex dynamics of the situation in Ghana. Given that "Illegal gold mining operations are criticised heavily throughout Ghana" and that there has been an increase in the contribution of both large and small-scale sectors to Ghanaâ€™s gold output, it is plausible that miners are exploring other routes within the legal parameters of the mining industry.
