Ghana’s tradition of artisanal gold mining and the gold price boom which began in 2007 led tens of thousands of Chinese migrants to seek their fortunes in Ghana

Ghana, Africa’s second-largest gold producer, last week ordered large mining companies to sell 20% of the metal they refine to the central bank from January 1 as it builds up reserves of bullion to be used to import fuel and reduce demand for dollars after its currency plunged 57% this year.

Illegal gold mining operations are criticised heavily throughout Ghana due to their detrimental environmental effects, which many believe outweigh any possible economic and cultural justifications.

Small scale mining key to Ghana become the leading producer of Gold in Ghana

Quoting Joshua Mortoti, the President of the Ghana Chamber of Mines, the report said gold output rose to 3.7 million ounces in 2022 from 2.8 million ounces the previous year, driven by growth in the output of both large and small-scale sectors.

Ghana’s tradition of artisanal gold mining and the gold price boom which began in 2007 led tens of thousands of Chinese migrants to seek their fortunes in Ghana.

This is because the detrimental impact of illegal small-scale gold mining on Ghana's farmlands is a cause for great concern.

Again, because the law on the exportation of gold says that 80% of the proceeds will have to come back to the country, it means that Ghana will have lots of foreign capital.

Addressing participants at a national stakeholders’ workshop on how to control illegal mining in Ghana held at Tarkwa recently, Dr. Aubyn said the reasons why illegal mining was still in existence was because of its complexity, relatively high gold price, greed and to get wealth quick mentality.

In Ghana, a crackdown on illegal miners exploiting the gold industry led to the deportation of thousands of Chinese nationals from the country.

According to the mining giant nearly half of the gold production in Ghana was “under stress” because of falling world prices at the time.

He said the gold industry used cyanide and activated carbons and other processes to produce gold bars, which contributed about 33.3 per cent of the country’s export earnings, with Ghana importing about 5.5 million dollars of the product into the industry.

Even if gold, diamonds, or oil, are discovered in every region of Ghana, the people would still suffer because politicians won't let the truth also prevail in the politics of the nation.

Even if we discount, and we shouldn’t, the fact that their Ghanaian operations involve securities, we cannot do that for the second leg of their operations, which presumably happens overseas, because they must continually RE-INVEST the deposited gold in order to generate returns from which to pay their customers.

Rising gold prices and rising gold production in Ghana should lead to our royalties being valued higher but this deal because it is choosing the stock market listing approach has ended up undervaluing the resource by more than 65%.

Gold mining has always been a part of Ghana but in the last several years, however, largely unregulated galamsey mining resulted in contaminated water bodies which serve various communities.

“This special occasion to unveil locally refined and hallmarked gold is important for us as a nation because it fulfils our aspiration of adding value to precious minerals mined here in Ghana,” he said.
