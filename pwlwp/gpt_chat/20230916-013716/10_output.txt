Based on the given information, the probable reasons for the decline of illegal mining across Ghana are:

1. The profits from illicit gold extraction no longer compensate for the risk - Prices for illegal gold mining have significantly reduced from $420 to $200 per pound. The substantial decrease in prices could result in the profits not being sufficient to counterbalance the risks involved (risk of deaths due to illegal mining, legal repercussions, impact on environment, etc.) (Info from: "... illegal miners are only receiving $200 for a pound of gold.", "Illegal gold mining have lead to the killing of some Ghanaian nationals...", "Illegal gold mining operations are criticised heavily throughout Ghana due to their detrimental environmental effects...")
  
2. Illicit gold miners are now moving to foreign territories where the market rate for gold is more beneficial - The discovery of gold in greater quantities in neighbouring countries and plummeting prices in Ghana could incentivize illegal miners to move to foreign territories where they can receive better prices for gold. (Info from: "Imagine that gold is discovered in a neighboring country in even greater quantities, shifting the mining industry and causing prices to plummet in Ghana.")

3. The chosen one is not correct - Without further context or information about what 'the chosen one' refers to, it's hard to establish this as a reason for the decline in illegal mining.

4. This choice is the right one - This statement doesn't provide any specific reason for the decline of illegal mining.

5. Nothing from what was stated earlier - This is the least likely reason for the decline of illegal mining, as there are clearly factors stated earlier that may contribute to the decline, such as lower rewards and increased risks.
  
Please note that these reasons are ranked based on the information given, and could vary based on other unmentioned factors.
