```Ghanaians participating in unauthorized mining activities lack faith in the government and would choose to function without a license.```
This option could be plausible given the context. The text mentions that there is a significant amount of illegal mining activity in Ghana, and that the government has been trying to curb this through various measures, including implementing a ban on small-scale mining and increasing penalties for illegal mining. However, these measures have not been entirely successful, as illegal mining continues to be a problem. This could suggest that Ghanaians involved in unauthorized mining activities do not trust the government's ability to regulate the industry effectively and fairly, and therefore choose to operate without a license. For instance, the text states: "Illegal mining in the country has been a topical issue in the country for the past few years sparking major campaigns and outrage by Ghanaians especially over the negative impact on the activities on water bodies and lands." This indicates a lack of faith in the government's ability to manage the mining industry.

```The new, speeded-up licensing process is not acknowledged by Ghanaians who are applying for a license.```
This option could also be plausible. The text does not provide any specific information about how the new licensing process has been communicated to Ghanaians, or how well it has been received. It is possible that the information about the new, faster process has not been effectively disseminated, or that Ghanaians who are applying for a license are not aware of the change. This could explain why the number of licenses granted has remained the same despite the reform. For example, the text mentions: "The Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners, is unhappy about governmentâ€™s decision to extend the ban on small-scale mining by three more months." This suggests that there may be a communication gap between the government and miners.

```The three-month period to acquire a mining license is seen as too long in the eyes of Ghanaians.```
This option seems less likely given the context. The text mentions that the process to obtain a mining license used to take three years, and has now been reduced to three months. This is a significant reduction in time, and it seems unlikely that Ghanaians would still consider this to be too long. However, the text does not provide any specific information about how Ghanaians have reacted to the new timeline, so it is possible that some may still find it too lengthy. 

```Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining activities are not willing to risk being taxed by the authorities, while those not engaged in such activities are not interested in legal mining.```
This option could be plausible. The text mentions that the government has increased penalties for illegal mining, which could include taxes. It is possible that Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining activities are not willing to risk these penalties by obtaining a license. On the other hand, those not engaged in illegal mining may not be interested in legal mining, either due to the risks involved or because they are not interested in the industry. For instance, the text states: "The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians."

```None of the earlier discussed possibilities apply.```
This option could also be plausible. The text does not provide any specific information about why the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same despite the reform. It is possible that none of the earlier discussed possibilities apply, and that there are other factors at play. For example, the text mentions that the government has been trying to curb illegal mining through various measures, including implementing a ban on small-scale mining and increasing penalties for illegal mining. These measures may have discouraged Ghanaians from applying for a license, regardless of the new, faster process.
