    "choice": "Ghanaians engaged in unlawful mining activities do not have confidence in the government and would prefer to carry out their operations without a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible given the historical context of mining in Ghana. The context sentences indicate a history of mistrust and dissatisfaction with the government's handling of mining activities. For instance, one context sentence states, 'Looking at the current situation, I think that the government is taking Ghanaians for granted.' This suggests a lack of confidence in the government's actions. Additionally, another context sentence mentions, 'Illegal mining in the country has been a topical issue in the country for the past few years sparking major campaigns and outrage by Ghanaians especially over the negative impact on the activities on water bodies and lands.' This could imply that some Ghanaians prefer to carry out their operations without a license due to a lack of trust in the government's ability to manage mining activities effectively and fairly."

    "choice": "Ghanaians in need of a license are oblivious to the new, expedited licensing procedure.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible if there was a lack of effective communication about the new reforms. The context sentences do not provide direct evidence of this, but it is a possibility. For example, one context sentence states, 'We hope that the Ghanaian government will pay due attention to this situation, take the necessary action to stop such things from happening again and guide the media to give an objective coverage on the illegal mining issue so as to create a good environment for further development of our bilateral exchanges and cooperation.' This could suggest that there may be a need for better communication from the government about changes in mining policies and procedures."

    "choice": "It is thought by Ghanaians that three months is an overly long time to receive a mining license.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible if Ghanaians perceive the new three-month timeline as still being too long. The context sentences do not provide direct evidence of this perception, but it is a possibility. For instance, one context sentence states, 'The Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners, is unhappy about governmentâ€™s decision to extend the ban on small-scale mining by three more months.' This could suggest that miners may be impatient with delays and could perceive a three-month wait for a license as too long."

    "choice": "Ghanaians who are involved in illegal mining activities are not interested in risking taxation by the authorities, while those who are not involved in such activities have no interest in legal mining.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible given the context sentences. For instance, one context sentence states, 'The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians.' This suggests that those involved in illegal mining activities may be deterred by the risk of taxation and penalties. On the other hand, those not involved in such activities may not have an interest in legal mining, possibly due to the risks and challenges associated with the industry."

    "choice": "None of the previously stated explanations are valid.",
    "rank": 5,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible if the reasons for the unchanged number of mining licenses granted after the reform are unrelated to the explanations provided. The context sentences do not provide direct evidence to support or refute this option. However, it is possible that other factors, such as economic conditions, market demand for minerals, or other regulatory changes, could be influencing the number of mining licenses granted."
