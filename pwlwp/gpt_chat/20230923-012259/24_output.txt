    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible given the context provided. There are several instances in the context where Ghanaians express distrust towards the government's handling of the mining industry. For example, one quote states, 'Looking at the current situation, I think that the government is taking Ghanaians for granted.' Another quote mentions, 'We see this development to be extremely serious breaches of Ghanaiansâ€™ trust, and in some cases breaches of administration procedures, guidelines and laws regarding mining in protected forest reserves by the Government of Ghana itself.' These sentiments could potentially discourage Ghanaians involved in illegal mining from trusting the government's new licensing process, leading them to prefer operating without a license."

    "choice": "Ghanaians who would like a license are unaware of the new, expedited licensing process",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This option could also be plausible. The context does not provide any information about how the new licensing process was communicated to the public. If the government did not effectively disseminate this information, it is possible that many Ghanaians who would like a license are simply unaware of the new, expedited process. This could explain why the number of mining licenses granted remained the same a month after the reform was implemented."

    "choice": "Ghanaians think three months is too long to obtain a mining license",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This option seems less likely given the context provided. Prior to the reform, it took three years to obtain a mining license. The new process significantly reduces this time to three months. The context does not provide any evidence to suggest that Ghanaians think three months is too long to obtain a license. In fact, the reduction in time could be seen as a positive change that makes the process more accessible."

    "choice": "Ghanaians involved in illegal mining do not want to risk being taxed by authorities, while Ghanaians that are not involved in illegal mining are not interested in legal mining",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible. The context mentions that the government has increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining, which could potentially include taxation. This could discourage Ghanaians involved in illegal mining from obtaining a license. Additionally, the context suggests that many Ghanaians are not satisfied with the state of the mining industry, which could deter those not involved in illegal mining from becoming interested in legal mining."

  {
    "initial_id": 5,
    "choice": "None of the above",
    "rank": 5,
    "justification": "This option seems unlikely given the context provided. The context suggests that there are several potential reasons why the number of mining licenses granted remained the same after the reform was implemented. Therefore, it is likely that at least one of the above options is correct."
