Read the following question delimited with backticks ``` Imagine the Ghanaian government implements reforms that change the time it takes for local residents to obtain a mining license – traditionally a big motivation for illegal mining. Instead of three years, they can now do it in three months. Suppose that a month after implementing the new reform, the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same. This would have been likely because… ```. Use the following context sentences delimited with backticks as background knowledge ``` Whereas prior to 2013 many miners sought to establish long term operations in Ghana, after 2013 they began instead to follow a three year cycle.

“They are expected to run until the expiration of the last mining lease in Ghana”, the AG opined, adding: “The agreements also appear to be cast in stone with no options to evaluate their effectiveness and/or satisfactory performance so as to renew or terminate same should the need arise.

Sanctioning the moratorium on the operations of general small-scale mining activities in Ghana has brought untold hardship on us and most Ghanaians in the areas where the small-scale mining is based, it is practically our hope that, the vision that our President has will go a long way in vindicating the measures that are rolled out to propel the future of the small-scale mining industry”.

Citing the decision by both the Lands Ministry and the Forestry Commission to grant mining and entry permits into Ghana’s forest reserves in 2018 when there was still an active ban on all forms of large and small-scale mining activities in the country, the NDC argued that government’s fight against the illegal mining menace was a ruse to enable some persons in both government and party to appropriate the illicit trade for themselves.

“The association is not oblivious of the reservations of the government and the populace to some of the ills of our activities and its attendant effects on the environment, which has resulted in a six-month moratorium on all forms of small-scale mining activities in Ghana.

“They were the ones that provided the mining equipment, most of the Ghanaians left behind can’t continue their operations,” said one of the local residents, but many Ghanaians concerned about the health and environmental hazards lauded the government’s efforts to curb illegal mining.

Ghana is fast becoming like how El-Salvador was before the ban on mining, but even though government is doing all it can to bring a complete halt to all such methods of mining, not only society, but some members of state institution like the Ghana Immigration Service and also some traditional leaders, do not support this.

There continue to be growing opinions in fighting the menace of illegal mining with several Ghanaians proposing different ways to tackle the situation which has greatly affected the integrity of several water bodies across the country and the latest to add his bit is the NDC MP.

Despite the conventional knowledge in Ghana that the activities of some mining companies have severely impacted negatively on the environment, coupled with the notion that not enough is being done about this by sector regulators, this might not exactly be the situation in every circumstance.

According to the Lease Letter from the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, once the Company, TGGL warranted that it had the wherewithal in terms of finance, technical, and human resources to undertake efficient mining operations, and had declared its willingness to engage in mining in Ghana, the Government of Ghana could not, but grant the rights to mine in the specified area to it, and maybe renewed periodically in accordance with the law.

Even though sanctioning the moratorium on the operations of general small scale mining activities in Ghana has brought untold hardship on us and most Ghanaians in the areas where the small scale mining are based, it is practically our hope that, the vision that our President has will go a long way in vindicating the measures that is rolled out to propel the future of the small scale mining industry.

“We hope that the Ghanaian government will pay due attention to this situation, take the necessary action to stop such things from happening again and guide the media to give an objective coverage on the illegal mining issue so as to create a good environment for further development of our bilateral exchanges and cooperation.

This is mainly because, public benefits from the Government's mining activities have not been realized, as mining leases are mainly granted by the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources (Section 34 of the Minerals and Mining Act 2006) to foreign companies and individuals (p. 4, Ghana Mining Industry Review) which are believed to be based on their interests, and not on the interests of the state.

It has been predicted that Ghana may import water by 2030 if illegal mining is not banned.

They are expected to run until the expiration of the last Mining Lease in Ghana.

“It is in this spirit that the government of Ghana in March 2016 signed a development Agreement with Gold Fields Ghana covering it’s operations in Tarkwa and Damang Mines expected to run for 11 and 9 years respectively.

The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians, and a minimum of 20 years imprisonment, together with a fine of not less than 100,000 penalty units for foreigners with the hope that those found guilty would be made to face the full rigorous of the law.

Per this logic, it is therefore proper to allow foreigners to plunder our natural resources and give paltry sums in return, whilst the government wants the Ghanaian people to believe that it is ungodly to engage in small scale mining.

Ghanaians didn’t support the ban; daring its financial, employment and local economy implications because we were happy seeing small scale miners go out of business.

Delivering a paper on the topic, “The Legal Regime of the Mining Sector in Ghana”, at a public lecture in Kumasi, organized by the Students’ Representative Council (SRC) of the Ghana School of Law, the Minister said the nation ought to aspire for more local participation in the mining industry.

The Minister of Science, Environment, Technology and Innovation also said the lifting of the ban on small-scale mining “does not mean foreign miners who are hiding in Ghana or escaped into neighbouring countries can come and continue their illegal activities.

“We see this development to be extremely serious breaches of Ghanaians’ trust, and in some cases breaches of administration procedures, guidelines and laws regarding mining in protected forest reserves by the Government of Ghana itself,” he added.

“We believe that we have a responsibility to go round the country and brief the citizens on especially responsible and sustainable mining, because the mineral resources belong to each and everyone one of us, so generally the people of Ghana should understand the mining industry and that’s why we decided that we should move out of the mining areas and come to the north.

The results of the research also showed that 37% of Ghanaians are satisfied with government’s fight against illegal mining (galamsey), which is gradually restoring the purity of some of the water bodies lost to the illegal activities.

According to her, the NDC has been in government for eight years but Ghanaians never really saw any upfront charge taken to cure the menace of illegal mining.

The proponents want the Government of Ghana to ensure that clean, scientific and environmentally friendly technologies are deployed in the mining of mineral resources in the Volta and Oti Regions and undertake contracts that would be of immense benefit to landowners and communities.

He said although small-scale mining is the sole preserve of the citizenry, some Ghanaians agree with outsiders to use un-prescribed equipment to mine, leading to the destruction of the forest, water bodies and farmlands because regulatory bodies are not well-resourced to clamp down on their illegal activities.

The Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners, is unhappy about government’s decision to extend the ban on small-scale mining by three more months.

I don’t think we have Ghanaians who are satisfied with the way our mining communities are.

Illegal mining in the country has been a topical issue in the country for the past few years sparking major campaigns and outrage by Ghanaians especially over the negative impact on the activities on water bodies and lands.

Looking at the current situation, I think that the government is taking Ghanaians for granted.

We still have hope that the Government of Ghana has everything it takes to handle these Fulani herdsmen if it has been able to handle illegal mining to some extent.

I watched Newsfile on 9 October 2022 and could not believe what illegal mining has done and is doing to Ghana and Ghanaians.

We hope that the Ghanaian government will pay due attention to this situation, take the necessary action to stop such things from happening again and guide the media to give an objective coverage on the illegal mining issue so as to create a good environment for further development of our bilateral exchanges and cooperation.

According to him, the government of Ghana has not banned small scale mining as many thought however there is a ban on illegal mining.

“We think it is very important that any operation against illegal mining should be carried out in line with Ghanaian laws and international recognized norms, the mass arrest and media hype should be minimized, the cases should be dealt with on individual base and the legitimate rights of the miners should be respected,” it said.

The Minister for Environment, Science and Technology, Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, has stressed the importance of ending illegal mining in Ghana.

I believe, and in fact, many Ghanaians believe that if the NPP rules this country for eight years, Ghana will not be the same again.

The convener for Youth Empowerment Summit, Mr Clement Adjei Sarfo, has said government's temporal ban on small-scale mining activities has brought hardship to countless number of Ghanaians whose livelihood depended solely on the sector directly or indirectly.

We hope that the Ghanaian government will pay due attention to this situation, take the necessary action to stop such things from happening again and guide the media to give an objective coverage on the illegal mining issue so as to create a good environment for further development of our bilateral exchanges and cooperation,” the mission said.

Apparently, some concerned Ghanaians are inferring that since the NDC 2024 flagbearer, former President Mahama, has promised somewhat audaciously that in the event of returning to the presidency, the collapsed banks licences will be restored, he could well review the revoked mining licences.

“Today without any form of license, some Ghanaians are conniving with foreigners to mine everywhere with explosives and machinery in forest reserves and water bodies,” Akufo-Addo said at the launch of the National Alternative Employment programme for Illegal Mines.

His frustration stems from the fact that the small-scale mining sector has enormous potentials that can easily change the economic fortunes of the country because “the mining law is explicit that it is only Ghanaians who can participate in that sector”.

A majority of Ghanaians want the government to regulate natural resource extraction such as mining, oil drilling, and wood harvesting more tightly to reduce its negative impacts on the environment, the latest Afrobarometer survey shows.

Furthermore, the engineer thought that formalized small-scale mining are operated in USA, Canada, Colombia, Peru, etc, without water pollution so Ghanaians can replicate same in Ghana.

“We need to bridge the trust gap between government and the mining industry, which I think is not peculiar to Ghana alone.

“On Ghana, we do expect growth to slow this year [2023] … ```.
      Provide long and thorough justifications for each of the choices independently, without referring to the other choices, while citing the context using quotes.:
	```Ghanaians participating in illicit mining activities have no faith in the government and would choose to function without a license.
Ghanaians desiring a license are not informed about the new, fast-tracked licensing process.
The period of three months to secure a mining license is viewed as too long by Ghanaians.
Ghanaians who are part of illegal mining activities are not ready to take the risk of being taxed by the authorities, while those not involved in such activities show no interest in legal mining.
None of the aforementioned factors are applicable.```
