    "choice": "Ghanaians involved in illicit mining activities have no trust in the government and would prefer to work without a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a lack of trust between the Ghanaian government and the miners. For instance, the context states, 'Looking at the current situation, I think that the government is taking Ghanaians for granted.' This suggests a level of mistrust and dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the mining sector. Additionally, the context also mentions, 'The Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners, is unhappy about government’s decision to extend the ban on small-scale mining by three more months.' This further indicates a lack of trust and dissatisfaction with the government's decisions regarding mining. Therefore, it is plausible that Ghanaians involved in illicit mining activities would prefer to work without a license."

    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a lack of understanding or awareness about the new licensing process. For instance, the context states, 'According to him, the government of Ghana has not banned small scale mining as many thought however there is a ban on illegal mining.' This suggests that there might be a lack of understanding or misinformation about the government's policies on mining. Therefore, it is plausible that the new, quickened licensing process is not understood by Ghanaians who are interested in getting a license."

    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that Ghanaians involved in mining activities might be impatient with the licensing process. For instance, the context states, 'The Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners, is unhappy about government’s decision to extend the ban on small-scale mining by three more months.' This suggests that the miners are impatient with the government's decisions that delay their mining activities. Therefore, it is plausible that a three-month timeframe to secure a mining license could be deemed too long by Ghanaians."

    "choice": "Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities are not willing to risk taxation by the authorities, while those not involved in such activities are not interested in legal mining.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities might be avoiding taxation. For instance, the context states, 'The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians.' This suggests that the government has imposed heavy penalties, including taxation, for illegal mining. Therefore, it is plausible that Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities are not willing to risk taxation by the authorities."

However, as explained above, each of the earlier stated reasons can be justified using the provided context sentences. Therefore, this choice is not likely to be correct."
