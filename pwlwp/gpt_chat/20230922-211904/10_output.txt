    "choice": "The perception among government officials is that any compromise would make them seem weak, so they are not prepared to suggest such an option.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a strong stance by the government against illegal mining activities. The government has taken the issue of illegal mining seriously due to its impact on the economy and the environment. The government has developed a five-year multilateral mining integrated project to improve the management of small-scale mining and protect the environment. This suggests that the government is committed to enforcing strict regulations and is not prepared to compromise on this issue. As stated, \"The Ghanaian government has taken the issue of illegal mining seriously because apart from the impact on our economy, its impact on the environment is dire.\" and \"We have developed a five year multilateral mining integrated project to improve the management of small scale mining to protect the environment...\"."

    "choice": "The government's inability to enforce mining protocols for a distributed collection of mines as it does for a single, large mine hinders the realization of environmental benefits.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is justified by the context that highlights the challenges the government faces in regulating small-scale mining activities. The government has struggled to combat illegal mining due to the difficulty in bringing perpetrators to justice and the involvement of those in positions of authority in these malpractices. As stated, \"The main issue in Ghana has been illegal mining, which has been difficult to combat since the law makes it difficult to bring perpetrators to justice and, more crucially, because those in positions of authority sometimes participate in the malpractices.\""

    "justification": "This choice could be justified by the context that suggests the involvement of local chiefs in the mining activities. The context does not directly mention the role of local chiefs, but it does highlight the importance of local participation and the need for all stakeholders to derive maximum benefits from mining activities. As stated, \"To ensure all stakeholders most importantly the State derive the maximum benefits from gold exports, the Ghana Chamber of Mines is entreating government to initiate effective mechanisms to streamline activities and operations of artisanal and small scale mining operators.\""

    "justification": "This choice is justified by the context that suggests that small-scale miners, or galamseyers, are driven by the potential for high profits from illegal mining activities. Despite the negative impacts on the environment and the threat to human survival, these miners continue to engage in irresponsible mining activities. As stated, \"Irresponsible small-scale mining activities across mining communities in Ghana continue to have adverse impacts on lands and water resources and threaten human survival in mining areas.\""
