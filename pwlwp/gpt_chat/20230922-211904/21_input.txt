Read the following question delimited with backticks ``` In Ghana two systems of mining are in conflict: large-scale, regulated, corporate mining and widespread but small-scale, unregulated, illegal mining. The former has less of a negative impact on the environment but also provides less of a benefit to the surrounding communities than does the latter, which provides more jobs but wreaks havoc on the environment.  Imagine a third option: government-organized and regulated, community-scale operations conducted in partnership with corporate mines.  Government provides access to land and civil infrastructure; corporations, to equipment and world markets.  The main reason the third option will not succeed is because: ```. Use the following context sentences delimited with backticks as background knowledge ``` Irresponsible small-scale mining activities across mining communities in Ghana continue to have adverse impacts on lands and water resources and threaten human survival in mining areas.

The move, he said, is to allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner under the five-year multilateral mining integrated project.

This hinders efforts to ensure a transparent, equitable and optimal exploitation of mineral resources to underpin broad-based sustainable growth and socio-economic development in achieving the tenet of the Africa Mining Vision through the Ghana Country Mining Vision.

According to the group in a statement copied to GhanaWeb, the inauguration of the two new community mining sites in the Western Region should rather focus their attention on genuinely solving the significant environmental problem that’s been caused by the disastrous management of mining in Ghana, especially in the Western Region.

We have developed a five year multilateral mining integrated project to improve the management of small scale mining to protect the environment, but at the same time to allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner under this five-year multilateral mining integrated project, we will be identifying prospective areas for small scale mining where we will then direct the small scale miners to those particular areas so that they are not just mining haphazardly.

The Ghanaian government has taken the issue of illegal mining seriously because apart from the impact o on our economy, its impact on the environment is dire.

Require that the government and mining corporations/operators live up to their social responsibility under Ghana and International law to ensure any mining or industrial activities are done safely without any negative impact on the community/environment and use designated funds to improve these areas.

QUOTE: “Illegal mining has caused terrible destruction to water and land in Ghana and appropriate measures must be put in place to deal with it.

Developed a 5-Year Multilateral Mining Integrated Project to improve the management of small scale mining to protect the environment and allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner  .

Ultimately, creating a more robust regulatory environment is seen as an important tactic in attracting major mining companies to invest in the country, to complement the contribution made by Ghana’s small-scale miners.

“We think, concerted efforts between China and Ghana is needed to address the illegal mining issue and strengthen the South control and also elevate transparency in mining sector to open more channels for legal and open business” Mrs. Baohong added.

There is perhaps no single industry in Ghana that has precipitated more disputes over land-use than mining.

In Ghana, many sociologists extend the scope of damage that mining can produce to include potentially adverse impacts on society and cultural heritage and the health and safety of mine workers.

Mining activities in Ghana have raised huge concerns amongst the populace as the menace is now destroying the environment, especially water bodies and land resources.

It is important to note that the very existence of Ghana as a country is being threatened by illegal mining activities.

The proponents want the Government of Ghana to ensure that clean, scientific and environmentally friendly technologies are deployed in the mining of mineral resources in the Volta and Oti Regions and undertake contracts that would be of immense benefit to landowners and communities.

The main issue in Ghana has been illegal mining, which has been difficult to combat since the law makes it difficult to bring perpetrators to justice and, more crucially, because those in positions of authority sometimes participate in the malpractices.

“we understand and realises the importance of the small scale mining sector to the economy of Ghana so, we do not have problem to that if government wants to allow the comeback of small scale miners into operation.

To protect the natural environment, no mining company in Ghana - large or small, foreign or local - must ever be allowed by society to flout the regulations and laws contained in the amended Mining Act without the appropriate sanctions being applied by the authorities against them.

“We believe that we have a responsibility to go round the country and brief the citizens on especially responsible and sustainable mining, because the mineral resources belong to each and everyone one of us, so generally the people of Ghana should understand the mining industry and that’s why we decided that we should move out of the mining areas and come to the north.

[caption id="attachment_46336" align="aligncenter" width="564"] Small-scale mining has been suspended in Ghana due to their destruction of most water bodies and farmlands[/caption] The Minerals Commission has asked Ghanaian small-scale miners to form alliances that will see them become a large-scale operator in the country’s mining industry.

When a large number of Ghanaians are contemplating stopping small scale mining completely until the regulators and Ministry of Lands and Forestry are able to wrap their minds around the menace?

In fact, small scale mining is stopped in Ghana, increasing unemployment and crime rates since these jobless individuals must survive by all means.

Illegal mining in Ghana has led to the destruction of several forest reserves and water bodies across the country despite various efforts by the government to clamp down on the menace.

He noted that mining businesses play a crucial and important role in Ghana’s economy and progress and that the government will implement any policy or assistance that will allow their smooth operation and profit maximization.

With the support of the government and various stakeholders, this responsible mining approach is expected to have a positive impact on the local community and contribute to Ghana's sustainable development.

Whereas Ghanaian law allows land owners to mine their own property, as well as sublet to artisanal miners, many small scale miners also operate outside the law, working on public lands or in remote regions.

According to the mining technical person, the small-scale operations in Ghana can be properly managed to create lucrative employment for the Ghanaian citizens in the rural areas so that the rural-urban migration can be minimized.

We believe in responsible mining and we strongly support the enforcement of the country’s law to curb irresponsible and illegal mining that is causing a lot of harm to the environment and health of Ghanaians.

The main issue here is credibility, as Mr. Amewu noted that the Akufo-Addo government was looking to ensure mining Ghana is done “in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.

By enlightening citizens about the environmental, health, and socioeconomic consequences, Ghana can foster a sense of responsibility and encourage the reporting of illegal mining activities.

He said the activities of illegal mining had resulted in the formation of sinkholes, contamination of soil, ground and surface water pollution, and loss of biodiversity, thus affected the environment and human life, and stressed that “Ghana cannot look on unconcerned while the water bodies are contaminated to risk the inherent health hazards.

The first solution is, the Ghanaian government has to build new industries in the mining, fishing, and agricultural sectors.

To ensure all stakeholders most importantly the State derive the maximum benefits from gold exports, the Ghana Chamber of Mines is entreating government to initiate effective mechanisms to streamline activities and operations of artisanal and small scale mining operators.

Unregulated small scale mining by both local and foreign nationals had caused massive destruction to Ghana’s environment, especially water bodies and forest reserves.

An improved, competitive policy framework is expected to enable Ghana take advantage of the emerging mining industry investment destinations in the sub-region to encourage manufacturing, engineering and fabrication firms to set up manufacturing bases in Ghana to offer services to the mining industry.

In Ghana, some small-scale mining/galamsey continue to cause so much damage while very few ultimately benefit from it.

“The association is not oblivious of the reservations of the government and the populace to some of the ills of our activities and its attendant effects on the environment, which has resulted in a six-month moratorium on all forms of small-scale mining activities in Ghana.

"Our aim is to express concerns at the way mining related permits are leading to the destruction of Ghana's forest reserves and the pollution of water bodies," says Eco-Conscious Citizens founder and coordinator Awula Serwah.

Therefore, adequate technical, financial, economic, and organisational assistance or support should be provided to enhance small-scale mining operations in Ghana.

“We in Dunkwa district of the Ghana National Association Small Scale Miners are ready to demonstrate to the people of Ghana with our structure, including our monitoring taskforce that, with the backing of the minister of Land and Natural Resources, the Regional Minister of both Ashanti and Central Regions, the various Metropolitan Municipal and District Chief Executive as well as the various paramount chief within our jurisdiction, our policy of self-policing and regulation would reduce the cost of fighting illegal mining to the state and would promote sustainable small scale mining for job and wealth creation for all with the right support from the state, our successes would be out there for other mining districts to learn from,” Mr. Annan added.

“The mining industry’s sustainability in Ghana and making Ghana the mining hub of Africa does not lie in just training people, but building local capacity to respond to the mining needs of the entire continent,” he stressed.

He however said Small Scale mining has proven to help retain wealth from gold mining in the country to improve living standards of the people given that Ghana has gained nothing significant from foreign-owned large-scale mining companies, therefore it must be properly regulated to operate.

The implementation of a Mining Cadastre Administration System in Ghana is expected to help prevent disputes over concession boundaries and significantly reduce human interventions in the mineral rights acquisition and management process.

A research fellow at the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Kojo Asante, has observed that illegal mining has become a norm in recent times because societies are aggrieved that a chunk of revenue generated from natural resources within their respective locations go to the central government.

We have also launched a major offensive against ‘galamsey’ in Ghana to protect our water bodies and our environment, suspended the issuance of small-scale mining licences to restructure the sector, developed a 5-year multi-lateral mining integrated project to improve the management of small-scale mining to protect the environment and allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner.

Speaking to the Ghana News Agency in Kumasi, he said illegal mining was causing serious devastation to the country’s forest and water bodies and there was the need for all to join the government to halt the menace.

These are a few of the many examples that could aid policy makers in Ghana in implementing policies that will make good use of abandoned mining sites.

Government intends to make conscious efforts to integrate the mining industry with the rest of the local economy, thus making it possible for Ghanaian entrepreneurs to increase their participation in the mining industry, especialiy in the area of providing goods and services, Mr Asomah-Cheremeh added.

Lots of lives have been lost due to illegal mining in Ghana.

The effects of mining indiscriminately in Ghana has for some time now become unbearable. ```.
      Provide long and thorough justifications for each of the choices independently, without referring to the other choices, while citing the context using quotes.:
	```The notion among government officials is that any compromise would make them seem weak, hence they are not ready to advocate for such an option.
The government's inability to enforce mining protocols for a distributed collection of mines in the same way as for a single, large mine leads to unrealized environmental benefits.
Local chiefs, whose authority will be undermined by this third option that doesn't provide them a role, are unlikely to be supportive.
Galamseyers retain a strike it rich, gold rush perspective and will not exchange it for the certain, but barely adequate income from other alternatives.
None of the scenarios mentioned earlier.```
