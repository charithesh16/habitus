    "choice": "Government officials are of the opinion that any compromise would make them appear weak, therefore they are not inclined to put forward such an option.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "The context suggests that the Ghanaian government has been taking a strong stance against illegal mining, with various efforts to clamp down on the menace. The government has also been working on improving the management of small-scale mining to protect the environment and allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner. However, there is no mention of any willingness to compromise or collaborate with illegal miners or corporate mines. This could be interpreted as a fear of appearing weak or lenient towards illegal activities. As one context sentence states, \"The main issue in Ghana has been illegal mining, which has been difficult to combat since the law makes it difficult to bring perpetrators to justice and, more crucially, because those in positions of authority sometimes participate in the malpractices.\""

    "choice": "Environmental benefits are not achieved because the government cannot enforce mining protocols for a distributed collection of mines as it can for a single, large mine.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "The context suggests that the government has been struggling to enforce mining protocols, especially for small-scale and illegal mining operations. As one context sentence states, \"Unregulated small scale mining by both local and foreign nationals had caused massive destruction to Ghanaâ€™s environment, especially water bodies and forest reserves.\" This implies that the government has been unable to effectively regulate and enforce environmental protocols for a distributed collection of small-scale mines. In contrast, it might be easier for the government to enforce these protocols for a single, large mine, which is likely to have more resources and infrastructure to comply with regulations."

    "choice": "This third option, which does not include a role for local chiefs, will dilute their power, making it improbable that they will join in.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "The context suggests that local chiefs and communities play a significant role in the mining industry in Ghana. As one context sentence states, \"The proponents want the Government of Ghana to ensure that clean, scientific and environmentally friendly technologies are deployed in the mining of mineral resources in the Volta and Oti Regions and undertake contracts that would be of immense benefit to landowners and communities.\" This implies that any mining operation that does not include a role for local chiefs could potentially dilute their power and influence, making it unlikely that they would support such an operation."

    "choice": "Galamseyers maintain a gold rush, strike it rich mindset and are not prepared to swap it for the definite, but barely sufficient remuneration from other possibilities.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "The context suggests that many small-scale miners, or \"galamseyers,\" are driven by the prospect of striking it rich. As one context sentence states, \"In Ghana, some small-scale mining/galamsey continue to cause so much damage while very few ultimately benefit from it.\" This implies that these miners may not be willing to give up the potential for large profits in exchange for the more modest, but guaranteed, remuneration offered by regulated mining operations."
