    "choice": "Ghanaians who partake in illegal mining activities harbor distrust towards the government and would opt to operate without a license.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible given the historical context of mining in Ghana. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a persistent issue in Ghana for over two decades, despite clear laws against it. This could suggest a level of distrust or disregard for the government and its regulations among those involved in illegal mining. For instance, the context sentence 'Although Ghana’s laws are clear on illegal mining, the activity has been allowed to continue for more than two decades' suggests that illegal miners may not trust or respect the government's authority. Additionally, the context sentence 'Regrettably, some incompliant Ghanaians have been violating the small-scale mining law over the years without the corresponding punishment' further supports this notion. Therefore, even with the implementation of a faster licensing process, these individuals may still opt to operate without a license due to their distrust towards the government."

    "choice": "The new, faster licensing process is unknown to Ghanaians who want a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible if the government did not effectively communicate the changes in the licensing process to the public. The context sentences do not provide direct evidence for this, but it is a possibility given the context sentence 'The Minerals Commission of Ghana is, however considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small-scale mining to spark an overhaul of the country’s mining sector and deal with the illegal mining menace.' This suggests that the government is making changes to the mining sector, but it does not specify how these changes are being communicated to the public. If the new, faster licensing process is not well-known among Ghanaians who want a license, this could explain why the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same."

    "choice": "Ghanaians believe that a three-month period to get a mining license is excessive.",
    "rank": 5,
    "justification": "This option seems unlikely given the context sentences. Prior to the reform, it took three years to obtain a mining license. The context sentence 'Instead of three years, they can now do it in three months' suggests that the new process is significantly faster. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Ghanaians would consider a three-month period to be excessive, especially when compared to the previous three-year period."

    "choice": "The risk of being taxed by authorities deters Ghanaians involved in illegal mining, while those not involved in such activities have no interest in mining legally.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible. The context sentences suggest that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana, and those involved in it may be deterred by the risk of being taxed by authorities if they obtain a license. For instance, the context sentence 'The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said' suggests that the government is taking measures to crack down on illegal mining. This could deter illegal miners from obtaining a license due to the risk of being taxed. On the other hand, those not involved in illegal mining may have no interest in mining legally, which could also explain why the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same."

    "choice": "None of the prior stated causes are relevant.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This option could be plausible if there are other factors not mentioned in the choices that are influencing the number of mining licenses granted. The context sentences suggest that there are many complexities and challenges associated with mining in Ghana, and it is possible that other factors not mentioned in the choices are at play. For instance, the context sentence 'Most of the licenses are issued to big companies out of Ghana and that is why everyone is turning to illegal mining' suggests that the dominance of foreign companies in the mining sector could be a factor. Additionally, the context sentence 'According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities' suggests that there may be systemic barriers that make it difficult for Ghanaians to obtain mining licenses. These factors could be influencing the number of mining licenses granted, making the prior stated causes irrelevant."
