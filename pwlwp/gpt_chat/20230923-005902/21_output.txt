```Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities have no confidence in the government and would rather operate without a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a history of mistrust and dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the mining sector. For instance, the context mentions that "Illegal mining has become a menace that successive governments in Ghana have tried to put an end to but seem to fail at every opportunity." This could imply that illegal miners have lost confidence in the government's ability to manage the sector effectively and fairly. Additionally, the context also mentions that "The Minerals Commission of Ghana is, however considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small-scale mining to spark an overhaul of the country’s mining sector and deal with the illegal mining menace." This could further erode trust as it suggests that the government is considering measures that could potentially disadvantage small-scale miners.

```The recently established, expedited licensing process is not understood by Ghanaians who wish to obtain a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that the licensing process may be complex and not well understood by potential applicants. For instance, the context mentions that "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." This suggests that the process of obtaining a license may be difficult to navigate, which could deter potential applicants.

```The three-month period to secure a mining license is seen as too extended by Ghanaians.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that the time it takes to obtain a mining license has been a significant issue in the past. For instance, the context mentions that "Instead of three years, they can now do it in three months." This suggests that the time it takes to obtain a license has been reduced significantly, but it's possible that some potential applicants still see this as too long.

```Ghanaians involved in illegal mining activities are not willing to risk taxation, while those not involved in such activities are not interested in mining legally.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests that taxation could be a deterrent for some potential applicants. For instance, the context mentions that "Most of the licenses are issued to big companies out of Ghana and that is why everyone is turning to illegal mining." This suggests that the cost associated with obtaining a license, which could include taxes, may be a deterrent for some potential applicants.

```None of the earlier discussed possibilities apply.```
This choice could be justified if none of the other choices accurately reflect the reasons why the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same despite the reforms. The context provides several potential reasons why this might be the case, but it's possible that none of these reasons accurately capture the situation. For instance, the context mentions that "The Minerals Commission of Ghana is considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small scale mining, to enable an overhaul of the country’s mining sector." This suggests that the number of licenses granted may have remained the same because the government is considering suspending the issuance of new licenses.
