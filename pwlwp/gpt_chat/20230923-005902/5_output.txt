```Those Ghanaians who are engaged in unauthorized mining activities have a lack of trust in the government and would rather work without a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a history of mistrust and dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the mining sector. For instance, the context mentions that "Illegal mining has become a menace that successive governments in Ghana have tried to put an end to but seem to fail at every opportunity." This could indicate a lack of trust in the government's ability to manage the sector effectively. Additionally, the context mentions that "Regrettably, some incompliant Ghanaians have been violating the small-scale mining law over the years without the corresponding punishment." This could suggest that some Ghanaians prefer to operate without a license, possibly due to a lack of trust in the government's ability to enforce the law fairly and consistently.

```The new, expedited licensing process is not known to Ghanaians who are seeking a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a lack of communication or awareness about changes in the mining sector. For instance, the context mentions that "The Minerals Commission of Ghana is considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small scale mining, to enable an overhaul of the country’s mining sector." This could indicate that changes in the licensing process may not be well communicated or understood by those seeking a license. Additionally, the context mentions that "We are reliably informed of plans by the government to amend the laws on small scale mining which allows only Ghanaians to acquire such license, to medium scale mining which will create an avenue for foreigners to also obtain such licenses." This could suggest that information about changes in the mining sector may not be widely disseminated or understood by those affected.

```Three months is considered too lengthy by Ghanaians to acquire a mining license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a history of lengthy and complex licensing processes in the mining sector. For instance, the context mentions that "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." This could indicate that the previous three-year process was considered too lengthy by many Ghanaians, and a three-month process may still be seen as too long.

```Ghanaians engaged in unlawful mining activities are unwilling to face taxation from authorities, whereas those not participating in such activities show no interest in legal mining.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a reluctance among some Ghanaians to engage in legal mining due to potential taxation and other costs. For instance, the context mentions that "Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts." This could indicate that some Ghanaians may be unwilling to engage in legal mining due to the financial costs involved, including potential taxation.

```None of the previously mentioned reasons apply.```
This choice could be justified if none of the provided reasons accurately reflect the reasons why the number of mining licenses granted has remained the same after the implementation of the new reform. The context does not provide a clear answer to this question, and it is possible that other factors not mentioned in the choices could be at play. For instance, the context mentions that "The Minerals Commission of Ghana is, however considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small-scale mining to spark an overhaul of the country’s mining sector and deal with the illegal mining menace." This could suggest that the number of licenses granted has remained the same due to a suspension or slowdown in the issuance of new licenses, rather than any of the reasons provided in the choices.
