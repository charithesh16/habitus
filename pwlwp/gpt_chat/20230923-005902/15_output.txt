```Ghanaians participating in illegal mining do not believe in the government and would rather function without a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context sentences that highlight the ongoing issue of illegal mining in Ghana, despite clear laws against it. For instance, the context sentence "In spite of the fact that Ghana’s laws are clear on illegal mining, the activity has been allowed to continue for more than two decades" suggests that illegal miners continue their activities despite the legal consequences. This could be due to a lack of trust in the government and its regulations, leading them to prefer operating without a license.

```Ghanaians aspiring for a license are uninformed about the new, accelerated licensing process.```
This choice could be justified by the context sentences that suggest a lack of information or understanding about the mining licensing process. For example, the context sentence "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities" implies that there may be a lack of awareness or understanding about the licensing process among Ghanaians, which could explain why the number of licenses granted has not increased despite the new, accelerated process.

```Ghanaians perceive the three-month duration to get a mining license as too prolonged.```
This choice could be justified by the context sentences that suggest a long-standing issue with the length of time it takes to obtain a mining license in Ghana. For example, the context sentence "Instead of three years, they can now do it in three months" implies that the previous three-year duration was seen as too long by many. However, if the number of licenses granted has not increased after the reform, it could be because some Ghanaians still perceive the three-month duration as too prolonged.

```The fear of being taxed by authorities prevents Ghanaians involved in illegal mining from going legal, while those not involved in such activities are not interested in legal mining.```
This choice could be justified by the context sentences that suggest a fear of taxation or legal consequences among illegal miners. For example, the context sentence "Ghanaian offenders are usually charged with “mining without licence" implies that there are legal consequences for illegal mining, which could deter some from seeking a legal license. Additionally, the context sentence "Most of the licenses are issued to big companies out of Ghana and that is why everyone is turning to illegal mining" suggests that those not involved in illegal mining may not be interested in legal mining due to the perception that licenses are primarily granted to large, foreign companies.

```None of the previously discussed scenarios are accurate.```
This choice could be justified if none of the context sentences provided support the scenarios described in the other choices. However, as discussed above, there are context sentences that could potentially justify each of the other choices. Therefore, this choice would likely not be the most accurate.
