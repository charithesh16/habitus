    "justification": "The context suggests that illegal mining has been a persistent issue in Ghana for over two decades, despite clear laws against it. This could indicate a lack of trust in the government and its regulations among those involved in illicit mining activities. For instance, the context states, \"In spite of the fact that Ghanaâ€™s laws are clear on illegal mining, the activity has been allowed to continue for more than two decades.\" and \"Illegal mining has become a menace that successive governments in Ghana have tried to put an end to but seem to fail at every opportunity.\" These statements suggest that illegal miners may have little faith in the government's ability to manage the mining sector effectively, leading them to operate without a license."

    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "The context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim. However, it is plausible that some Ghanaians may not be aware of the new, expedited licensing process. The context mentions that the government has made several attempts to reform the mining sector, such as considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small-scale mining and implementing a six-month ban on small-scale mining. These measures may have caused confusion or uncertainty among potential license applicants, leading them to be unaware of the new, faster licensing process."

    "justification": "The context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim. However, it is mentioned that \"Most of the licenses are issued to big companies out of Ghana and that is why everyone is turning to illegal mining.\" This could suggest that the process of obtaining a license, even if expedited to three months, may still be viewed as too long or cumbersome by some Ghanaians, leading them to resort to illegal mining instead."

    "justification": "The context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim. However, it is mentioned that \"The amended mining law of Ghana has stipulated a minimum of 15 years and maximum of 25 years for illegal miners (galamseyers), President Nana Akufo-Addo has said.\" This could suggest that those involved in illegal mining operations may be averse to the risk of taxation or other legal consequences associated with obtaining a license. On the other hand, those not involved in such operations may have no interest in legal mining, either due to lack of resources, lack of interest, or other reasons."

However, the context provides evidence that could support several of the other options, such as a lack of faith in the government among illegal miners and potential confusion or lack of awareness about the new licensing process. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the aforementioned factors are applicable."
