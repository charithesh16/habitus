```Ghanaians involved in illicit mining activities have no trust in the government and would choose to operate without a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a history of mistrust and dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the mining sector. For instance, the context mentions that "Illegal mining has become a menace that successive governments in Ghana have tried to put an end to but seem to fail at every opportunity." This could imply that illegal miners do not trust the government's ability to manage the sector effectively, hence their preference to operate without a license. Additionally, the context also mentions that "The Minerals Commission of Ghana is considering a suspension of the issuance of new licenses for small scale mining, to enable an overhaul of the countryâ€™s mining sector." This could further fuel mistrust as it suggests instability and uncertainty in the licensing process.

```The new, hastened licensing process is not recognized by Ghanaians who are applying for a license.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a potential lack of awareness or acceptance of the new licensing process. For instance, the context mentions that "We are reliably informed of plans by the government to amend the laws on small scale mining which allows only Ghanaians to acquire such license, to medium scale mining which will create an avenue for foreigners to also obtain such licenses." This suggests that changes to the mining laws and processes may not be widely recognized or accepted by Ghanaians, especially if they perceive these changes as favoring foreigners.

```A three-month timeframe to obtain a mining license is deemed too extensive by Ghanaians.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a history of lengthy and complex licensing processes. For instance, the context mentions that "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." This suggests that the previous licensing process was seen as too extensive and difficult, which could mean that even a three-month timeframe is still seen as too long by Ghanaians.

```Ghanaians involved in illegal mining are not ready to risk being taxed, while those not involved in such activities do not show interest in legal mining.```
This choice could be justified by the context that suggests a reluctance among illegal miners to engage with the formal sector due to potential costs such as taxes. For instance, the context mentions that "Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts." This suggests that the costs associated with legal mining, including potential taxes, could be a deterrent for illegal miners.

```None of the earlier stated reasons are correct.```
This choice could be justified if none of the context sentences provided support the earlier stated reasons. However, as explained above, there are context sentences that could potentially justify each of the earlier stated reasons. Therefore, this choice would not be justified based on the provided context.
