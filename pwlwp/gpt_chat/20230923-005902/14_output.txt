    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This possibility could be true given the historical context of mining in Ghana. The context sentences mention that 'Illegal mining has become a menace that successive governments in Ghana have tried to put an end to but seem to fail at every opportunity.' This suggests a lack of trust in the government's ability to effectively regulate the mining sector. Additionally, the context sentences mention that 'Regrettably, some incompliant Ghanaians have been violating the small-scale mining law over the years without the corresponding punishment.' This could indicate a lack of fear of repercussions, further eroding trust in the government's ability to enforce its laws."

    "choice": "The newly introduced, expedited licensing process is unfamiliar to Ghanaians who desire a license.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This possibility could be true as the context sentences do not provide any information on how the new licensing process was communicated to the public. It is possible that Ghanaians who desire a license are not aware of the changes or do not understand how to navigate the new process. The context sentences mention that 'According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities.' This suggests that the process of obtaining a license has historically been challenging, which could contribute to unfamiliarity with the new process."

    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This possibility could be true given the historical context of mining in Ghana. The context sentences mention that 'Instead of three years, they can now do it in three months.' This suggests that the process of obtaining a mining license has been significantly expedited. However, it is possible that Ghanaians still perceive three months as too long, particularly if they are used to operating without a license and are eager to start mining legally."

    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This possibility could be true as the context sentences mention that 'Most of the licenses are issued to big companies out of Ghana and that is why everyone is turning to illegal mining.' This suggests that Ghanaians may be deterred from legal mining due to the perceived risk of being taxed. Additionally, the context sentences mention that 'The effects of mining indiscriminately in Ghana has for some time now become unbearable.' This could indicate a lack of interest in legal mining among those who are not already involved in illegal mining activities."

    "rank": 5,
    "justification": "This possibility could be true if the reasons for the unchanged number of mining licenses granted are not related to the reasons mentioned in the earlier possibilities. The context sentences do not provide definitive evidence to support or refute any of the earlier possibilities, so it is possible that none of them are true."
