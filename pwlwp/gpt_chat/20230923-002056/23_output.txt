    "choice": "Ghanaians that were participating in illegal mining felt comfortable applying for a license because of the shortened wait time",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana, with many Ghanaians engaging in it due to the difficulty in securing permits and licenses for mining operations. For instance, one context sentence states, \"According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities.\" Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have encouraged Ghanaians who were previously participating in illegal mining to apply for a license. The shortened wait time would make the process less daunting and more accessible, potentially leading to an increase in the number of mining license applications."

    "choice": "Ghanaians who were not previously mining now see it as a new economic opportunity",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context provided. The context sentences suggest that mining is a capital-intensive operation that can provide significant economic benefits. For example, one context sentence states, \"Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts.\" Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made mining more appealing as an economic opportunity to Ghanaians who were not previously involved in the sector. The quicker process would make it easier for them to enter the mining industry and potentially reap its economic benefits, leading to an increase in the number of mining license applications."

    "choice": "Ghanaians are influenced to seek mining licenses by their friends/family",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "While this choice is possible, the context sentences do not provide direct evidence to support it. The context sentences do not mention the role of friends or family in influencing Ghanaians to seek mining licenses. However, it is conceivable that friends or family could play a role in such decisions, particularly in a context where mining is a significant economic activity and where the process of obtaining a mining license has been made easier. Nevertheless, without specific evidence from the context sentences, this choice remains speculative."

  {
    "initial_id": 4,
    "choice": "None of the above",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is unlikely given the context provided. The context sentences suggest that both the first and second choices are plausible explanations for why the number of mining license applications would have tripled following the implementation of reforms that reduced the time it takes to obtain a license. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that none of the above choices are likely."
