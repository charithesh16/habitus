    "choice": "The shortened wait time encouraged Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This justification is supported by the context sentences which highlight the issue of illegal mining in Ghana. The context sentences state that 'The main issue in Ghana has been illegal mining, which has been difficult to combat since the law makes it difficult to bring perpetrators to justice' and 'Lots of lives have been lost due to illegal mining in Ghana.' The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have encouraged those engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license, as it is now a quicker and more accessible process. This is further supported by the context sentence that states 'The president has over the years assured Ghanaians of his commitment to end illegal mining and even legal mining that degrades the environment.' This suggests that the government's efforts to combat illegal mining could have influenced the increase in mining license applications."

    "choice": "For Ghanaians who had not been mining before, it is now perceived as a new financial opportunity.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This justification is supported by the context sentences which highlight the financial opportunities associated with mining in Ghana. The context sentences state that 'According to him, this type of mining has created over 1 million jobs for many Ghanaians across various communities' and 'Government intends to make conscious efforts to integrate the mining industry with the rest of the local economy, thus making it possible for Ghanaian entrepreneurs to increase their participation in the mining industry, especially in the area of providing goods and services.' The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have made mining a more attractive financial opportunity for Ghanaians who had not been mining before, leading to an increase in mining license applications."

    "choice": "The push from their friends or family has influenced Ghanaians to pursue mining licenses.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "While the context sentences do not directly address the influence of friends or family on Ghanaians' decision to pursue mining licenses, they do highlight the significant role that mining plays in Ghanaian society and economy. The context sentences state that 'The first solution is, the Ghanaian government has to build new industries in the mining, fishing, and agricultural sectors' and 'As a Mining Engineer and a key stakeholder of the mining industry of this country, I have decided to add my voice to the trending issue of Goldfields Ghana Limited, Tarkwa Gold Mine making a transition from owner mining to contract mining which will lead to over 1,700 Ghanaians losing their jobs and hereby petition the government to step in with immediate effect.' These sentences suggest that mining is a major source of employment and economic activity in Ghana, which could influence friends or family to encourage Ghanaians to pursue mining licenses."

    "initial_id": 4,
    "choice": "None of the aforementioned factors.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice suggests that none of the previously mentioned factors - the shortened wait time, the perception of mining as a new financial opportunity, or the influence of friends or family - were responsible for the tripling of mining license applications. However, the context sentences provide evidence that all of these factors could have contributed to the increase in applications. Therefore, this choice is not supported by the context sentences."
