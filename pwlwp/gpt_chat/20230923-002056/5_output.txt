    "choice": "Due to the reduced waiting period, Ghanaians involved in illegal mining felt at ease to apply for a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana, with many Ghanaians engaging in it due to the difficulty in securing permits and licenses for legal mining operations. For instance, one context sentence states, \"According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities.\" Therefore, the reduction in the waiting period for obtaining a legal mining license from three years to three months could have made it easier and more appealing for Ghanaians involved in illegal mining to apply for a license, leading to the tripling of the number of applications."

    "choice": "It is now seen as a fresh economic prospect by Ghanaians who had not been involved in mining before.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that mining is a capital-intensive operation, and many Ghanaians who secure mining concessions end up passing such licenses to their foreign counterparts due to lack of upfront capital. For instance, one context sentence states, \"Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts.\" Therefore, the reduction in the waiting period for obtaining a legal mining license could have made mining seem like a more accessible and attractive economic prospect to Ghanaians who had not been involved in it before, leading to the tripling of the number of applications."

    "choice": "The encouragement from friends and family has led Ghanaians to apply for mining licenses.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is less plausible given the context provided. The context sentences do not provide any information suggesting that encouragement from friends and family has played a significant role in leading Ghanaians to apply for mining licenses. Therefore, while it is possible that such encouragement could have contributed to the tripling of the number of applications, there is no direct evidence in the context sentences to support this claim."

    "initial_id": 4,
    "choice": "None of the previously mentioned reasons.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is unlikely given the context provided. The context sentences provide evidence supporting the first two choices, suggesting that the reduction in the waiting period for obtaining a legal mining license could have made it easier for Ghanaians involved in illegal mining to apply for a license and made mining seem like a more accessible and attractive economic prospect to Ghanaians who had not been involved in it before. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the previously mentioned reasons contributed to the tripling of the number of applications."
