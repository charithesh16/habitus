```Because of the shortened wait time, Ghanaians who were involved in illegal mining felt more encouraged to apply for a license.```
This justification is plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining has been a significant issue in Ghana, with many Ghanaians engaging in it due to the difficulty in securing permits and licenses for legal mining operations. For instance, one context sentence states, "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." By reducing the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license, the Ghanaian government may have made it more appealing for those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license and operate within the law. This could explain the tripling of mining license applications within three months.

```Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining now perceive it as a fresh financial opportunity.```
This justification is also plausible given the context provided. The context sentences indicate that mining is a capital-intensive operation, and many Ghanaians who manage to secure mining concessions end up passing such licenses to their Chinese counterparts due to lack of upfront capital. For instance, one context sentence states, "Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts." By reducing the time it takes to obtain a mining license, the Ghanaian government may have made it more feasible for Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining to perceive it as a fresh financial opportunity. This could explain the tripling of mining license applications within three months.

```Ghanaians are seeking mining licenses due to the influence from their friends and family.```
While this justification is possible, the context sentences do not provide direct evidence to support it. The context sentences do not mention the influence of friends and family on Ghanaians' decisions to seek mining licenses. However, it is plausible that social influence could play a role in such decisions, especially in a context where mining is seen as a potentially lucrative opportunity and the government has made efforts to make obtaining a mining license more accessible.

```None of the earlier discussed factors.```
This justification is unlikely given the context provided. The context sentences suggest that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have influenced Ghanaians' decisions to apply for a license, either by making legal mining more appealing to those previously involved in illegal mining or by making mining seem like a more accessible financial opportunity to those not previously involved. Therefore, it is likely that at least one of the earlier discussed factors played a role in the tripling of mining license applications within three months.
