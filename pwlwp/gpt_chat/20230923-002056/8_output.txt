```Ghanaians engaged in illegal mining were motivated to apply for a license due to the decreased wait time.```
This is a plausible explanation because the context suggests that the process of obtaining a mining license in Ghana was previously time-consuming and difficult, which may have discouraged some people from applying. The context states, "In Ghana, the process can take up to six months, and in most cases, it could delay due to disagreement among lawmakers." and "According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities." Therefore, reducing the time it takes to obtain a license from three years to three months could have motivated those engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license.

```Ghanaians who had not previously been involved in mining now view it as a novel economic possibility.```
This is also a plausible explanation because the context suggests that mining is a lucrative industry in Ghana. The context states, "According to him, this type of mining has created over 1 million jobs for many Ghanaians across various communities." and "As part of measures to promote job creation in the mining industry through the use of local expertise, goods and services, the provision of goods and services by Ghanaians will help us retain US$3 billion annually." Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made mining a more attractive economic opportunity for Ghanaians who had not previously been involved in the industry.

```Ghanaians have been persuaded to seek mining licenses due to the influence of their friends and family.```
While the context does not provide direct evidence to support this explanation, it is possible that social influence played a role in the increase in mining license applications. The context suggests that mining is a common occupation in Ghana, stating, "According to him, this type of mining has created over 1 million jobs for many Ghanaians across various communities." Therefore, it is plausible that friends and family members who are involved in mining could have influenced others to seek mining licenses, especially given the reduced wait time.

```None of the prior stated causes.```
This explanation cannot be justified using the provided context, as the context does provide evidence to support the other explanations. The context suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have motivated both those engaged in illegal mining and those not previously involved in mining to apply for a license. The context also suggests that social influence could have played a role in the increase in mining license applications. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that none of the prior stated causes are likely explanations for the increase in mining license applications.
