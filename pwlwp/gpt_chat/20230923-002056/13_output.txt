    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice is plausible given the context. The context sentences indicate that illegal mining is a significant issue in Ghana, with many Ghanaians participating in it due to the difficulty in securing permits and licenses for legal mining operations. For instance, one context sentence states, 'According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities.' Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license from three years to three months could have made Ghanaians participating in illegal mining feel more confident about applying for a license, leading to the tripling of mining license applications."

    "choice": "Ghanaians who were not previously in the mining sector now see it as a new economic opening.",
    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice is also plausible given the context. The context sentences suggest that mining is a capital-intensive operation, and many Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital end up passing their mining licenses to their foreign counterparts. For example, one context sentence states, 'Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts.' Therefore, the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made mining seem like a new economic opening for Ghanaians who were not previously in the sector, leading to the increase in mining license applications."

    "choice": "The influence of their friends and family has prompted Ghanaians to seek mining licenses.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice is less plausible given the context. The context sentences do not provide any information suggesting that the influence of friends and family has prompted Ghanaians to seek mining licenses. Therefore, while it is possible that the influence of friends and family could have contributed to the increase in mining license applications, there is no direct evidence in the context sentences to support this claim."

    "choice": "None of the earlier mentioned possibilities.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice is unlikely given the context. The context sentences provide evidence supporting the first two choices - that Ghanaians participating in illegal mining felt more confident applying for a license due to the shortened wait time, and that Ghanaians who were not previously in the mining sector now see it as a new economic opening. Therefore, it is unlikely that none of the earlier mentioned possibilities would have contributed to the tripling of mining license applications."
