The group alleged that government is planning to amend the current laws on small scale mining which allows only Ghanaians to acquire such license, to medium scale mining that will open up and create an avenue for foreigners to also obtain such licenses and better still dominate the enterprise.

The time has now come for Ghanaian society to sieze the moment and end the impunity of the mining sector - in which fraudulently acquired rights resulting from corruption (payments of bribes?

Strangely, however, in spite of the fact that by law, only Ghanaians are allowed to obtain mining licenses for small-scale mining operations, “thousands” of Chinese and other foreigners are working in the small scale mining sector in Ghana.

The Ghanaian government has taken the issue of illegal mining seriously because apart from the impact o on our economy, its impact on the environment is dire.

In Ghana, the process can take up to six months, and in most cases, it could delay due to disagreement among lawmakers.

Given that the small scale mining operation is capital intensive, the Ghanaians who do not have the upfront capital, albeit manage to secure the mining concessions, end up passing such licences to their Chinese counterparts.

In the same month of January the government of Ghana placed what will be a two year ban on small scale mining which’s effects was threatening the environment and water bodies.

According to him, it is rather difficult for a Ghanaian to secure permits and licenses to operate mining firms, as opposed to foreigners, hence, forcing the Ghanaian youth to engage in illegal mining and its related activities.

The passage of Act 995, spearheaded by the Akufo-Addo administration in 2019, enhanced the sentences for both buying and selling minerals without a licence and undertaking a mining operation without a licence to a term of a minimum fifteen years imprisonment and maximum twenty-five years for a Ghanaian together with a fine of minimum ten thousand penalty units and not more than fifteen thousand penalty units.

“Additionally, the law seeks to bolster transfer of technology and know-how, and research and development programmes in the Ghanaian mining sector.

When a large number of Ghanaians are contemplating stopping small scale mining completely until the regulators and Ministry of Lands and Forestry are able to wrap their minds around the menace?

This is despite the fact Ghanaian law prohibits small-scale mining by non-citizens.

Developed a 5-Year Multilateral Mining Integrated Project to improve the management of small scale mining to protect the environment and allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner  .

The effects of mining indiscriminately in Ghana has for some time now become unbearable.

The new charges are undertaking a mining operation without a license, facilitating the participation of persons engaged in a mining operation, and the illegal employment of foreigners and entering Ghana while prohibited from re-entry.

The minister noted that with the support of the House, under the Minerals and Mining Amendment Act, 2019 (Act 995), the government had enhanced the punishment regime and increased the punishment for people engaging in illegal mining to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment together with a fine of not less than 10, 000 penalty units for Ghanaians, and a minimum of 20 years imprisonment, together with a fine of not less than 100,000 penalty units for foreigners with the hope that those found guilty would be made to face the full rigorous of the law.

As a Ghanaian Mining Engineer, I am a key stakeholder of the mining industry of this country and have decided to add my voice to the trending issue of Goldfields Ghana Limited, Tarkwa Gold Mine, making a transition from owner mining to contract mining, which will lead to over 1,700 Ghanaians losing their jobs, and hereby petition the government to step in with immediate effect.

The move, he said, is to allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner under the five-year multilateral mining integrated project.

“The revival of these two mines, the expansion of output by some existing mines, and the reduction of the withholding tax rate on unprocessed gold by small-scale miners, which was introduced in 2015, from three percent (3%) to one and a half percent (1.5%), have contributed significantly to Ghana’s new position on the continent".

As part of measures to promote job creation in the mining industry through the use of local expertise, goods and services, the provision of goods and services by Ghanaians will help us retain US$3 billion annually.

The amendments must make it unlawful for any Ghanaian to transfer small-scale mining licences to their foreign minions, and must also prohibit allocation of mining lands to the illegal miners.

We have also launched a major offensive against ‘galamsey’ in Ghana to protect our water bodies and our environment, suspended the issuance of small-scale mining licences to restructure the sector, developed a 5-year multi-lateral mining integrated project to improve the management of small-scale mining to protect the environment and allow Ghanaians to mine in a regulated and sustainable manner.

Lots of lives have been lost due to illegal mining in Ghana.

The charges are undertaking a mining operation without a licence, facilitating the participation of persons engaged in a mining operation, illegal employment of foreign nationals, and entering Ghana while prohibited from re-entry.

The current terms of the agreement as it stands will keep rolling continuously: Although Government of Ghana states that the agreement will terminate when the last of the 48 mining leases expires, mining agreements in Ghana are drafted to enable continuous renewal so long as gold is being discovered and commercially mined, therefore no end in sight for the agreement in its current form.

The proponents want the Government of Ghana to ensure that clean, scientific and environmentally friendly technologies are deployed in the mining of mineral resources in the Volta and Oti Regions and undertake contracts that would be of immense benefit to landowners and communities.

The main issue in Ghana has been illegal mining, which has been difficult to combat since the law makes it difficult to bring perpetrators to justice and, more crucially, because those in positions of authority sometimes participate in the malpractices.

The first solution is, the Ghanaian government has to build new industries in the mining, fishing, and agricultural sectors.

It is important to note that the very existence of Ghana as a country is being threatened by illegal mining activities.

Henceforth, the media must ensure that the regulatory bodies compel all mining companies in Ghana to operate strictly within the regulatory framework in the Minerals and Mining (Amendment) Law, 2014, which amended the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Act 703) to enable the minister for mines to seize the equipment and accoutrement's used by illegal miners.

“The association is not oblivious of the reservations of the government and the populace to some of the ills of our activities and its attendant effects on the environment, which has resulted in a six-month moratorium on all forms of small-scale mining activities in Ghana.

The president has over the years assured Ghanaians of his commitment to end illegal mining and even legal mining that degrades the environment.

This hinders efforts to ensure a transparent, equitable and optimal exploitation of mineral resources to underpin broad-based sustainable growth and socio-economic development in achieving the tenet of the Africa Mining Vision through the Ghana Country Mining Vision.

The President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says the time has come for mining companies operating in Ghana to begin producing inputs locally.

“Currently, Ghana has shares and carried interest in a number of mining companies that enable [the] government to receive significant cash flows from royalties and dividends.

Cumulatively, for a period of more than five years, the mining sector local content framework has resulted in the retention of huge amount of capital resources in Ghana, promoting local employment and the growth of domestic manufacturing.

By enlightening citizens about the environmental, health, and socioeconomic consequences, Ghana can foster a sense of responsibility and encourage the reporting of illegal mining activities.

He assured miners with a valid mining licence that had their concession seized of the opportunity to get their concessions back ”because we all Ghanaians; we will put in place new reforms for everyone to obey and lawfully mine”.

This led to a temporal ban on the activities of small-scale miners in March 2017 as part of efforts to sanitize the sector and cleanse the water bodies which serves millions of households in Ghana.

Strangely though, the same law allows a Ghanaian licence holder to seek logistics assistance from their foreign minions.
