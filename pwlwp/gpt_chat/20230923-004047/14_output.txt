"The shortened wait time made Ghanaians who were participating in illegal mining feel more comfortable to apply for a license."
This scenario is plausible because the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license could have made the process more appealing to those who were previously engaged in illegal mining. The previous three-year wait time might have been a deterrent, causing some individuals to resort to illegal mining as a quicker way to start their operations. However, with the new reforms reducing the wait time to just three months, these individuals might have felt more comfortable applying for a license. This is because the shorter wait time reduces the period they would have to wait before they can legally start or continue their mining operations. Therefore, this could explain why the number of mining license applications received by the government tripled within three months.

"It is now considered a new economic chance by Ghanaians who were not previously mining."
This scenario is also plausible. The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license could have made mining a more attractive economic opportunity for Ghanaians who were not previously engaged in this activity. Before the reforms, the three-year wait time might have been a significant barrier for those considering mining as a potential source of income. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, more people might have seen mining as a viable economic opportunity. This could have led to an increase in the number of people applying for a mining license, thus explaining the tripling of applications received by the government.

"Ghanaians are often motivated by their friends and family to apply for mining licenses."
This scenario could also explain the increase in mining license applications. Social influence can play a significant role in people's decisions, including their economic activities. If Ghanaians are often motivated by their friends and family to apply for mining licenses, the reduction in the wait time could have amplified this effect. With the process becoming quicker and more accessible, friends and family might have encouraged more people to apply for a license. This could have led to a surge in applications, resulting in the tripling of applications received by the government.

"None of the previously discussed scenarios."
This option suggests that none of the previously discussed scenarios are responsible for the increase in mining license applications. While this is a possibility, it would require other factors not mentioned in the provided scenarios to explain the tripling of applications. For instance, there could have been other changes in the mining sector or the broader economy that made mining more attractive. Alternatively, the increase could have been due to a combination of factors, including but not limited to those discussed in the previous scenarios. Without more information, it's impossible to definitively rule out any of the previous scenarios or identify other potential causes.
