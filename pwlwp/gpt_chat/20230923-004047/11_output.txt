    "choice": "The decrease in wait time made it more appealing for Ghanaians involved in illegal mining to apply for a license.",
    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This explanation suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license has made it more attractive for those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license. The previous lengthy process of three years could have been a deterrent for those involved in illegal mining to legalize their operations. However, with the reduction to three months, the process is now more manageable and less time-consuming, making it more appealing. This could have led to an increase in the number of applications received by the government. The context does not provide direct evidence for this explanation, but it is a plausible inference based on the change in the time it takes to obtain a license."

    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This explanation suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license has made mining a more attractive economic venture for Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining. The previous lengthy process of three years could have been a barrier for those considering mining as a potential economic venture. However, with the reduction to three months, the process is now more accessible, making mining a more attractive option. This could have led to an increase in the number of applications received by the government. The context does not provide direct evidence for this explanation, but it is a plausible inference based on the change in the time it takes to obtain a license."

    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This explanation suggests that social influence plays a significant role in the decision to apply for a mining license. Friends and family could have encouraged more Ghanaians to apply for a mining license, leading to an increase in the number of applications received by the government. However, the context does not provide direct evidence for this explanation. It is a plausible inference, but it would require additional evidence about the role of social influence in the decision to apply for a mining license in Ghana."

    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This option suggests that none of the previously stated explanations are the most likely reason for the increase in the number of mining license applications received by the government. It implies that there could be other factors at play that were not mentioned in the previous explanations. However, the context does not provide any evidence for this option. It is a plausible inference, but it would require additional evidence about other potential factors that could have led to the increase in the number of applications."
