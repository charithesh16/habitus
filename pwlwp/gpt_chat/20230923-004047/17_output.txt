    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This choice suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license encouraged those who were previously involved in illegal mining to apply for a license. The three-year wait time might have been a deterrent for these individuals, as they would have had to cease their mining activities for a significant period while waiting for their license. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, these individuals could potentially pause their activities for this shorter period and then resume mining legally. This could explain the tripling of mining license applications received by the government."

    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This choice suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license opened up new economic opportunities for Ghanaians who had not previously been involved in mining. The previous three-year wait time might have been a barrier to entry for these individuals, as they would have had to wait a significant amount of time before they could start mining. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, these individuals could potentially start mining much sooner, making it a more attractive economic opportunity. This could explain the tripling of mining license applications received by the government."

    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This choice suggests that the influence of friends and family could have played a role in the increase in mining license applications. If friends and family members were encouraging others to apply for a mining license, this could have led to an increase in applications. However, this choice does not directly relate to the change in the time it takes to obtain a license, so it would need to be assumed that the influence of friends and family became more significant as a result of this change."

    "choice": "None of the earlier stated reasons.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This choice suggests that none of the previously stated reasons were responsible for the increase in mining license applications. This could imply that there were other factors at play that were not mentioned in the other choices. For example, there could have been changes in the economic climate, changes in the demand for mined resources, or changes in the government's enforcement of mining regulations that led to the increase in applications. However, without more information, it is difficult to determine what these other factors might have been."
