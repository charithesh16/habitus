```Ghanaians who were involved in illegal mining felt more inclined to apply for a license because of the reduced wait time.```
This choice suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license may have encouraged those who were previously involved in illegal mining to apply for a license. The justification for this is that the previous three-year wait time may have been a deterrent for these individuals, leading them to engage in illegal mining instead. With the reduction in wait time to three months, the process of obtaining a license becomes less burdensome and more appealing. This could have led to an increase in the number of applications received by the government. However, the context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim.

```Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining now regard it as a fresh financial opportunity.```
This choice suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license may have attracted individuals who were not previously involved in mining. The justification for this is that the previous three-year wait time may have been a barrier for these individuals, preventing them from considering mining as a viable financial opportunity. With the reduction in wait time to three months, the process of obtaining a license becomes less daunting and more accessible. This could have led to an increase in the number of applications received by the government. However, the context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim.

```The push from their friends and family often leads Ghanaians to seek mining licenses.```
This choice suggests that the influence of friends and family may have contributed to the increase in the number of mining license applications. The justification for this is that friends and family can often play a significant role in influencing an individual's decisions and actions. If these individuals were encouraging others to apply for a mining license, this could have led to an increase in the number of applications received by the government. However, the context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim.

```None of the earlier mentioned possibilities.```
This choice suggests that none of the previously mentioned possibilities are likely to have caused the increase in the number of mining license applications. The justification for this is that there may be other factors not mentioned in the context that could have contributed to the increase. These could include changes in the economy, shifts in the job market, or alterations in government policies related to mining. However, the context does not provide direct evidence to support this claim.
