1. "Ghanaians involved in illegal mining felt more at ease applying for a license due to the reduced wait time." 
This choice suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license has made it more appealing for those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license. Previously, the three-year wait time might have been a deterrent, as it would have meant a long period of uncertainty and potential legal risk for those involved in illegal mining. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, the process of obtaining a license has become much more accessible and less risky. This could have encouraged more people involved in illegal mining to apply for a license, leading to the tripling of mining license applications.

2. "For Ghanaians who were not previously involved in mining, it is now perceived as a new financial venture."
This choice suggests that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license has made mining a more attractive financial venture for Ghanaians who were not previously involved in the industry. The previous three-year wait time might have been a significant barrier to entry, discouraging potential new entrants from considering mining as a viable financial venture. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, the barrier to entry has been significantly lowered. This could have led to more people considering mining as a potential financial venture and applying for a mining license, leading to the tripling of mining license applications.

3. "The urge to seek mining licenses among Ghanaians is often driven by their friends and family."
This choice suggests that the decision to apply for a mining license is often influenced by the applicant's social circle, including friends and family. If this is the case, then the tripling of mining license applications could be due to a ripple effect, where the decision of one person to apply for a license influences others in their social circle to do the same. The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a license could have acted as a catalyst for this ripple effect, making the process of obtaining a license more accessible and encouraging more people to apply.

4. "None of the earlier discussed factors."
This choice suggests that none of the factors discussed in the previous choices - the reduced wait time making it easier for those involved in illegal mining to apply for a license, the reduced wait time making mining a more attractive financial venture, and the influence of friends and family - are responsible for the tripling of mining license applications. If this is the case, then other factors not discussed in the previous choices must be responsible for the increase in applications. These could include factors such as changes in the economic climate, changes in government policy, or changes in the global demand for minerals.
