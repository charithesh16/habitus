    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This is a plausible explanation because the reduction in wait time for obtaining a legal mining license could have made the process less daunting and more accessible for those involved in illegal mining. Prior to the reform, the long wait time of three years might have discouraged illegal miners from applying for a license, as they would have had to cease their activities for a significant period of time while waiting for their application to be processed. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, these individuals might have felt more comfortable applying for a license, as they would only have to halt their activities for a much shorter period. This could explain why the number of mining license applications received by the government tripled within three months of the reform."

    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This is another plausible explanation. The reduction in wait time for obtaining a mining license could have made mining a more attractive economic prospect for Ghanaians who had not previously been involved in the industry. Prior to the reform, the long wait time of three years might have deterred these individuals from considering mining as a viable economic activity, as they would have had to wait a significant amount of time before they could start mining. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, these individuals might have seen mining as a more feasible and attractive economic opportunity, leading to an increase in the number of mining license applications."

    "choice": "Ghanaians often seek mining licenses due to the influence of their friends and family.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This explanation suggests that social influence plays a significant role in the decision to apply for a mining license. If this is the case, the tripling of mining license applications could be due to a ripple effect, where the decision of some individuals to apply for a license influenced their friends and family to do the same. This could have been facilitated by the reduction in wait time for obtaining a license, which might have made the process seem less daunting and more accessible, encouraging more people to apply."

    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This option suggests that none of the previously mentioned explanations are correct. If this is the case, the tripling of mining license applications could be due to other factors not mentioned in the options. For example, it could be due to changes in the economic environment, such as an increase in the demand for minerals, or changes in government policies, such as incentives for mining. However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the exact reasons for the increase in applications."
