    "rank": 1,
    "justification": "This could be a plausible reason because the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license may have made the process less daunting and more accessible for those who were previously engaged in illegal mining. The previous three-year wait time might have been a significant deterrent for these individuals, as it would have meant a long period of uncertainty and potential legal risk. By reducing this wait time to three months, the government may have made the prospect of legal mining more appealing, encouraging those who were previously engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license. This could explain the tripling of mining license applications received by the government within three months of the reform."

    "rank": 2,
    "justification": "This could also be a plausible reason because the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a mining license may have made mining a more attractive financial opportunity for Ghanaians who had not previously engaged in it. The previous three-year wait time might have been a significant barrier for these individuals, as it would have meant a long period of waiting before they could start earning from mining. By reducing this wait time to three months, the government may have made the prospect of earning from mining more immediate and appealing, encouraging more Ghanaians to apply for a license. This could explain the tripling of mining license applications received by the government within three months of the reform."

    "choice": "The decision of Ghanaians to pursue mining licenses is often influenced by their friends or family.",
    "rank": 3,
    "justification": "This could be a plausible reason because the decision to pursue a mining license is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including the opinions and experiences of friends and family. If friends or family members have had positive experiences with obtaining a mining license, or if they have been able to earn a good income from mining, this could encourage others to also apply for a license. The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a license could have made these positive experiences more common, thereby influencing more Ghanaians to apply for a license. This could explain the tripling of mining license applications received by the government within three months of the reform."

    "choice": "None of the aforementioned factors.",
    "rank": 4,
    "justification": "This option suggests that none of the previously mentioned factors - the shortened wait time making illegal miners more confident to apply for a license, mining being seen as a new financial opportunity, or the influence of friends and family - were responsible for the tripling of mining license applications. This could be a plausible reason if there were other significant changes or factors not mentioned in the context that could have led to the increase in applications. For example, if the government had also significantly reduced the cost of obtaining a license, or if there had been a major discovery of a valuable mineral resource, these could have been the primary drivers of the increase in applications, rather than the factors mentioned."
