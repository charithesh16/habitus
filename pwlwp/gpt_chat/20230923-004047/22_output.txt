```Ghanaians that were participating in illegal mining felt comfortable applying for a license because of the shortened wait time```: This choice could be justified by the fact that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license may have made the process more appealing to those who were previously engaged in illegal mining. Prior to the reforms, the long wait time of three years may have been a deterrent for those considering legal mining, leading them to opt for illegal mining instead. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, the process of obtaining a license has become more accessible and less time-consuming. This could have encouraged those who were previously engaged in illegal mining to apply for a license, as they can now do so without having to wait for an extended period of time. 

```Ghanaians who were not previously mining now see it as a new economic opportunity```: This choice could be justified by the fact that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a legal mining license may have made mining a more attractive economic opportunity for those who were not previously engaged in the activity. Prior to the reforms, the long wait time of three years may have been a barrier for those considering mining as a potential source of income. However, with the wait time reduced to three months, the process of obtaining a license has become more accessible and less time-consuming. This could have encouraged more people to consider mining as a viable economic opportunity, leading to an increase in the number of license applications.

```Ghanaians are influenced to seek mining licenses by their friends/family```: This choice could be justified by the fact that social influence can play a significant role in people's decisions. If friends or family members are applying for mining licenses and finding success in the mining industry, it could encourage others to do the same. The reduction in the time it takes to obtain a license could have made this process more appealing, leading to an increase in the number of applications. However, the context does not provide specific information about the role of social influence in this scenario.

```None of the above```: This choice suggests that none of the provided options are the most likely reason for the increase in mining license applications. However, based on the context, it seems plausible that the reduction in the time it takes to obtain a license could have influenced the decision of those who were previously engaged in illegal mining or those who were not previously engaged in mining to apply for a license. Therefore, this choice may not be the most likely reason for the increase in applications.
