Abstract.  Abstract.  Rice  is  one  of  the  most  significant  food  commodity 
products in Indonesia. The production of rice in 2019 reached 49.8 million 
tons. On a global scale, rice is consumed by half of the human population 
around the world. This study will support the development of sustainable 
natural resources management, which is an important thing to the realization 
of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  in  zero  poverty  and  zero  hunger. 
Remote  sensing  is  a  useful  instrument  to  monitor  natural  resources.  This 
study used Sentinel-2 imageries to extract rice phenology using vegetation 
indices (NDVI and NDWI), then acquired the planting and harvesting time 
using the temporal analysis. The NDVI value is showing a parabolic curve 
regarding the planting stage of the rice. The value of NDVI is high in the 
transplanting stage but decreases in the harvesting phase. Besides that, in the 
seedling  and  transplanting  stage,  NDWI  has  a  higher  value  than  NDVI. 
However,  in  tillering  until  the  harvesting  phase,  NDWI  has  a  similar 
characteristic but lower value than NDVI. Based on the spatial and temporal 
distribution of rice planting and harvesting date, it is known that climate is 
not a resistant factor, especially the irrigated rice field. Nevertheless, in the 
rainfed rice field, the planting time depends on climate conditions. 

Introduction 

1 
As one of the primary food commodities, rice is consumed by half of the global population 
[1]. Throughout a year, 150 million hectares of the rice crop area will averagely produce 500 
million tons of rice [2]. FAO argued that 90% of rice is planted and consumed by most Asian 
populations, with 60% are situated in South East Asia like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam 
[2]. In Indonesia, rice is the staple food commodity. The most significant production was 
found in 2019, with 49.8 million tons. However, the number of rice imports in Indonesia 
continuously increased, where the largest was found in 2018 (2.2 million tons) [3]. 

Rice comes from paddy, a grass plant with a cylindrical hollow trunk with a thin parallel 
leaf [4]. Based on location and water condition, IRRI classifies paddy within four classes, 
which are (i) irrigated rice field, (ii) lowland rainfed rice field, (iii) highland rainfed rice field,

and (iv) flood-prone rice field [5]. Based on the growth period, it can be classified into three 
types, (i) short period usually in 100 – 120 days, (ii) middle period usually in 120-140 days, 
and (iii) long period with 160 days or more [6]. According to the stages of development, the 
paddy development is divided into vegetative, generative, and ripening. Vegetative stages are 
indicated from sprouts growth until panicle initiation, and it commonly occurs 50 until 60 
days.  The  generative  phase  is  determined  from  panicle  initiation  until  heading,  and  it 
commonly occurs in 30 days. Lastly is the ripening stage [4]. 

Spatial data have played an important role in recent times [7]  and to be planned with a 
quality planning program and quality spatial component  [8]. As the United Nations (UN) 
Sustainable Development Goals support zero poverty and zero hunger, the development of 
sustainable  natural  resource  management  is  essential.  Particularly,  when  the  global 
population is expected to reach nine million people in 2050, it will become a big challenge, 
especially for sustainable food security.  

Remote sensing is an effective instrument for detecting changes in land-use or land-
cover [9]. It is labor effective compared to the more conventional terrestrial surveys [10]. 
Regarding the mapping process, rice has a specific spectral characteristic in the early stages 
of planting [1], and it keeps changing in every phase of the growing stages [11]. Therefore, 
information about the rice phenology is important when deciding the planting date, heading 
date,  and  harvesting  date  for  every  rice  crop  [12]. The  advantages  of  phenological-based 
research are to give an understanding of how the plant will respond to the climate condition 
and providing the reference for further food production [13]. This study aims to observe the 
spatial and temporal distribution of rice planting time and analyze the harvesting time based 
on phenological data from remote sensing-based vegetation index (NDVI and NDWI) and 
also to provide a method for creating spatial data in agricultural aspect. 

2  Methods 
This study uses Sentinel 2 level 2 multispectral satellite with a moderate resolution with 10 
x 10 meter spatial resolution with 24 images in total for 2019.  The information on rice age 
and growth phase is extracted from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and 
Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) [14,15]. Sentinel 2 (2A and 2B) have five days 
revisit time, which is reliable for the agricultural monitoring project [16]. This study uses a 
binary thresholding method and fuzzy overlay for satellite images using ESA SNAP to get 
the rice planting and harvesting date. 

2.1 Study Area 
The study is conducted in Parakansalak sub-regency that located in 6° 44’ 34.8” -  6° 49’ 
40.8” South dan 106° 39’ 54” - 106° 44’ 24” East. Relatively, the location is adjacents to 
Pamijahan sub-regency in the north,  Cidahu sub-regency in the east,  Bojonggenteng sub-
regency  in  the  south,  and  Kalapanunggal  sub-regency  in  the  west.  The  total  area  of 
Parakansalak is 5,571.45 hectares, with more than 600 hectares (12%) are the irrigated rice 
crop area. The topography and slopes are varied between the low-land area (200 above msl) 
and the high-land area (more than 700 above msl). 

There are three  main irrigation channels in Parakansalak,  which are Situ  Sukarame, 
Cipamatutan, and Cinala. The Situ Sukarame is irrigating Lebaksari, Bojongasih, and some 
areas in Bojonglongok. The water source in Situ Sukarame is from a natural lake called Situ 
Sukarame, located in eastern Parakansalak village, the northern part of Lebaksari. The rice 
field irrigated by Cipamatutan is unique because the rice field is aligned linearly with the 
Cipamatutan river. Cipamatutan is irrigating Sukakersa, some area in Parakansalak, and some 
area in Bojonglongok, in the north-south direction of the sub-district.

2.2 Image Acquisition  

2.2.1 

 Sentinel 2 Multispectral Satellite 

https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202123203020

Sentinel 2 was launched by European Space Agency (ESA) with two satellites (Sentinel 2-A 
and Sentinel 2-B). The temporal resolution is five days. The sensor is equipped with 10-meter 
four bands (red, green, blue, and near-infrared), six bands with a 20-meter spatial resolution 
(red edge and shortwave infrared band), and three bands with 60-meter resolution (aerosols, 
water vapor, and cirrus) for earth observation [17]. In this study, 24 imageries from 2019 are 
collected from the month of February until December. Each month has a minimum of one 
image with a maximum cloud cover of 20 percent. 

 

2.2.2 

 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 

The  NDVI  can  be  used  as  an  indicator  of  plant  greenness  [8,14,18].  NDVI  uses  the 
calculation of near-infrared and red bands. The formula is as follows: 

 NDVI = (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red)  

 

 

 

 (1) 

2.2.3 

 Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) 

The limitation for NDVI in rice  crop identification  is  found in the early stages of paddy, 
where the rice is planted in inundated land [1] and had only a few leaves. Therefore the water 
index is needed to determine the early stages of rice [19]. Normalized difference water index 
(NDWI) [15] using near-infrared and middle infrared/shortwave infrared. The formula is as 
follows: 

NDWI = (NIR – SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)

2.2.4 

 Planting Time and Harvesting Time with Thresholding Method 

To set the planting and harvesting time threshold value, this study using field data collection 
results and crosschecked with the previous study by Sari [12], Hernawati [20], and Lestari 
[21]. For phenological identification on the first step is analyzing the heading date [12,20]. 
Based on Lestari [21] range  of NDVI  value is 0.652 – 0.884 in  the  last  vegetative phase 
(include heading phase) about 60 days after planting [12]. And based on the field data result 
in  3.1,  the  threshold  value  at  the  heading  phase  for  NDVI  is  0.6.  After  heading  phase 
identification, planting date identification is about 60 days past from heading phase. Spectral 
characteristic in planting time based on Sari [12] and Hernawati [20] NDWI/LSWI value is 
greater or equal with NDVI value. In harvesting time, from the field data result in 3.1 the 
NDVI  value  is  0.6.  Based  on  Sari  [12]  and  Hernawati  [20]  and  field  data  result  the 
NDWI/LSWI value is lower than the NDVI value. The framework of the thresholding method 
is in Fig 2.

2.3 Field Data Acquisition 

Field  data  acquisition  is  conducted  for  collecting  rice  age  and  rice  variety.  The  sampling 
method used for collecting data is purposive grid sampling, with ±100 sample considering 
the existence of the farmer, the accessibility to the rice field, and the variation of rice field 
growth phase. A field survey was held from 24 August 2020 until 27 August 2020.  

 

3  Result and Discussion 

3.1 Rice Phenology Based on NDVI and NDWI Values 

NDVI always has a greater value than NDWI in each phase except land preparation. This is 
because of the background of the increasing crop canopy. Based on Fig 3., in the early phase 
of planting, farmers usually do some land preparation. In this stage, the rice crop is inundated,

lead to the value of NDWI is greater than NDVI because water is saturating the crop in the 
satellite image. In the planting stage, the NDWI value is approaching the NDVI value. From 
the planting stage until the heading phase of the rice plant the value of NDVI is increasing 
until maximum. From the heading phase until harvesting the value of both NDVI and NDWI 
is  decreasing  because  of  crop  canopy  yellowing  and  draining  of  water  in  rice  crop.  Rice 
phenology based on Fig 3. Supported with the quadratic graph model based on Fig. 4. and 
Fig. 5. which the NDVI value always greater than the NDWI value in the same rice age. The 
special  spectral  characteristic  in  the  heading  phase,  planting,  and  harvesting  stage  can  be 
analyzed for the threshold of planting and harvesting time.

Fig.3 Rice Phenology Graph Based on Vegetation Index 
 

The rice age model based on NDWI acquired from quadratic regression is in Fig. 4.  
resulting  in  the  equation  (3).  Then,  the  rice  age  model  based  on  NDVI  acquired  from 
quadratic regression is in Fig. 5. resulting in the equation (4).  For equations (3) and (4), X is 
the NDWI and NDVI value and Y is the estimated rice age. The R² of the NDWI model is 
0.14 with a significance of 0.02 with the RMSE of the model is 27 (days). For the NDVI 
model, the R² is 0.24 with the significance of the model 0.00 with RMSE of the model is 17 
(days). Based on R² of both models, NDVI has better goodness of fit rather than NDWI with 
notes that rice field which hasn’t planted yet (inundated) or in bare soil phase after harvested 
detected as an  intolerable outlier and removed. But  in NDWI value,  some rice  field  with 
water background in tillage before transplantation isn’t detected as on outlier which included 
for regression analysis. Therefore, the NDVI model in this study describing the rice field with 
only rice planted in it. Whereas the NDWI model describes the rice field from the tillage 
phase until rice is planted.

3.2  Value Distribution of NDVI and NDWI Based on Growth Phase 
 
In this study, Based on Fig. 6. the tendency of NDVI distribution value in planting time is 
mostly in the Q1 area with 0.12 value until the median with 0.22 value. While the NDWI, the 
tendency is mostly in Q1 with 0.12 value until median with 0.28 value. But Q3 of NDWI is 
higher than NDWI in 0.4 and the maximum value of NDWI is greater than  the maximum 
NDVI  value.  From  this,  the  planting  time  threshold  concept  is  when  the  NDWI  value  is 
greater or the same as the NDVI value.

NDWI even the outlier data of NDVI value is greater than  the maximum value of NDWI. 
Based on Lestari [22] range of NDVI value in  the heading phase is 0.652 until maximum 
value and from the field data, the NDVI toleratable outlier is 0.61. From this, the NDVI value 
in the heading phase is more than 0.6 and the NDWI value is lower than NDVI.

Based on Fig. 8. the tendency of NDVI distribution value in Harvesting time is mostly 
in the median area with 0.66 value until Q3 0.78 value. While the NDWI, the tendency is 
mostly in Q1 with 0.19 value until median with 0.3 value. Overall NDVI data is greater than 
NDWI, the maximum NDWI is equal to the toleratable outlier in 0.42 value for both indexes. 
Compared  to  the  maximum  value  of  NDVI  in  Fig.  7.  the  maximum  value  of  NDVI  in 
harvesting  time  is  lower.  Considering  the  value  of  the  heading  phase  threshold,  for  the 
harvesting  time,  this  study  set  the  NDVI  Value  with  0.6  in  the  lower  limit  of  Q1  as  the 
harvesting time threshold. For the NDWI value, set lower than NDVI same as heading phase 
threshold. The reason this study set 0.6 as the value of harvesting time threshold, because 
below  0.6  NDVI  value,  most  likely  below  that  value,  paddy  has  not  reached  the  heading 
phase.

3.3 Parakansalak 2019 Climate Condition 
Based on monthly rainfall 2018 and 2019 graph (Fig 4.), there is rainfall value decreasing 
between 2018 and 2019 in June, July, September, October, and November. In June 2019, the 
value of rainfall data is dropped from 184 mm to 2,96 mm. And in September 2019, the value 
of rainfall data is dropped from 80,8 mm to 17,7 mm. This can affect the rice planting season 
in Parakansalak. Local farmers also said that in 2019, in some rice crop areas, water discharge 
in some irrigation channels was decreased also caused by rainfall volume decreasing. Some 
irrigation  that  water discharge  was decreased, rice  crop area in lower elevation,  were not 
watered, cause the water was infiltrated before reaching the rice crop area.

3.4 Overall Model Accuracy  
Fig. 5. and Fig. 6. is a comparison graph between estimation and tabular data of planting and 
harvesting area from BPP  Parakansalak. The result shows that the root mean square error 
(RMSE)  between  tabular  and  estimation  data  is  145.37  hectares.  June  is  the  highest 
estimation in planting area with 145 hectares and the lowest planting area estimation is in 
October with 17 hectares.  Then, in the harvesting area, the root mean square error (RMSE) 
between tabular and estimation data is 90,9 hectares. The highest harvesting area estimation 
is in February with 289 hectares, overestimated then tabular data because no crosschecking 
with fuzzy overlay with heading phase in January. In January there are no available satellite 
images  with  clear  visibility.  The  lowest  harvesting  area  estimation  is  in  April  with  32 
hectares. The estimation of harvesting time area is higher compared with the estimation of 
planting.

4.4 Dry Season Planting and Harvesting Time 

Head of Parakansalak Agricultural Counselling Agency (BPP) argued that in Parakansalak 
there are two farming seasons, the first one is the dry season from April – September, and the 
second one is the wet season from October – March (in the next following year.  From Fig. 
5. and Fig. 6. farmers' tendency to start planting rice is in April, May, June and start to do 
harvesting  in  July  for  planting  in  April,  August  for  planting  in  May,  and  September  for 
planting in June. Related to the climate, June, July, August, and September are on dry month 
status with monthly total rainfall below 50 mm, critically, it ranges from 2 until 17 which is 
suitable when local farmers do some harvesting, but not enough water supply for rice planting 
after harvesting in August or September.  
 
 
On the  village  scale, the biggest  total area of planting based on thresholding  method 
within  April, May, and June  is Bojonglonggok  village  with 69.04 hectares total and  with 
average planting area in April, May, and June is 23.01 hectares. The lowest area of planting 
area  within  April,  May,  and  June  is  Lebaksari  village  with  31.06  hectares  total  with  an 
average planting area is  10.35 hectares. For another village, the average planting area in 
Bojongasih  village  is  17.10  hectares,  Parakansalak  village  is  19.16  hectares,  Sukakersa 
village  is  17.17  hectares  and  Sukatani  village  is  12.19  hectares.  Based  on  rice  age  in 
thresholding assumption, if rice field planted in April, the harvest will happen in July, then 
if rice field planted in May, the harvest will happen in August, and if rice field planted in 
June the harvest will happen in September.   
 
  Within  July,  August,  and  September,  the  biggest  harvesting  area  based  on  the 
thresholding method is Sukakersa village with a total harvested area is 115.74 hectares and

the  average  harvested  area  is  38.58  hectares.  The  lowest  harvesting  area  based  on  the 
thresholding method is Lebaksari village with a total harvested area of 51.36 hectares with 
the average harvesting area is 17.12 hectares. For another village, the average planting area 
in  Bojongasih  village  is  26.34  hectares,  Bojonglonggok  village  is  27.62  hectares, 
Parakansalak village is 22.68 hectares, and Sukatani village is 33.34 hectares.

For the next three months, the biggest total area of planting based on thresholding method 
within July, August, and September is Sukakersa village with 24.72 hectares total and with 
average planting area in April, May, and June is 8.24 hectares. The lowest area of planting 
area within April, May, and June is Lebaksari village with 2.88 hectares total with the average 
planting area is  0.96 hectares. For another village, the average planting area in Bojongasih 
village is 3.70 hectares, Bojonglonggok village is 7.40 hectares, Parakansalak village is 7.64 
hectares, Sukatani village is 5.32 hectares. Based on rice age in thresholding assumption, if 
rice  field planted in  July, the harvest  will happen in  October, then if rice  field planted  in 
August,  the  harvest  will  happen  in  November,  and  if  rice  field  planted  in  September  the 
harvest will happen in December.   
 
  Within  October,  November,  and  December,  the  biggest  harvesting  area  based  on  the 
thresholding method is Bojonglonggok village with a total harvested area is 59.24 hectares 
and the average harvested area is 19.75 hectares. The lowest harvesting area based on the 
thresholding method is Lebaksari village with a total harvested area of 15.45 hectares with 
the average harvesting area is 5.5 hectares. For another village, the average planting area in 
Bojongasih village is 9.97 hectares, Parakansalak village is 15.29 hectares, Sukakersa village 
is 17.76, and Sukatani village is 16.60 hectares.

4  Conclusion 
The  model  of  the  rice  phenology  based  on  NDVI  and  NDWI  has  a  moderate  result  with 
greater  R²  in  NDVI  than  NDWI.    In  partial  value  distribution,  for  heading  phase  and 
harvesting time, the value of NDVI is concentrated in a small range of data, and easier to 
deciding the value threshold for estimating the harvesting time if another index is used. Based 
on the result of estimated rice planting time and harvesting time with thresholding method 
using  Sentinel  2  satellite,  the  estimation  of  harvesting  time  has  more  suitable  result  than 
planting time with lower RMSE value with the monthly tabular data from BPP Parakansalak. 
If the tabular data is in daily unit, it is possible to know the exact result of the threshold model 
cause  of  the  limitation  of  Sentinel  2  images  towards  cloud  cover  or  the  result  will  more 
accurate if the same method is applied in radar remote sensing.
