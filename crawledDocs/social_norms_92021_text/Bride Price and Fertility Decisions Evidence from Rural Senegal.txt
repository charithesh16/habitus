ABSTRACT This paper provides evidence about the relationship between bride price payments and fertility
decisions in Senegal. Higher bride price payments reduce the fertility pressure for women with results
being robust to confounding socio-economic and contextual factors. The fertility-reducing impact is greater
for women who are economically dependent on their husbands. In polygamous households and for
arranged marriages, a lower bride price increases fertility pressure while in monogamous households
and for non-arranged marriages, the bride price does not affect fertility. As bride price payments have less
power over (economically) independent women, empowerment will give leeway to girls in traditional
societies.

1. Introduction

In many sub-Saharan African countries, particularly in Senegal, the bride price payment is a key
element of the marriage contract. Contrary to a dowry payment, where the bride and her family give
the marriage payment to the groom and his family, a bride price payment is defined as the money or
wealth transfer given by or on behalf of the groom to the bride and her family upon the marriage of the
couple. Such a bride price system raises several concerns related to the economics of the marriage
market, gender empowerment and intra-household bargaining power. The anthropological literature
has shown that bride price payments strengthen normative constraints on women’s autonomy in the
reproductive domain (Horne, Dodoo, & Dodua Dodoo, 2013). We consider a woman’s role in
marriage as represented by the fertility decisions of the couple. Previous research for the case of
Indonesia has shown that women who perceive more household assets as being their own have a
greater say in fertility decisions (Beegle, Frankenberg, & Thomas, 2001). Thus, fertility choices, as
measured by the number of children at a given age, can be taken as an indicator of female bargaining
power and a woman’s relative position within the household.

This paper is an important contribution to the existing literature as most of the studies about
marriage payments have been carried out in South Asia. The African context, in which a bride price
is paid, is substantially different and the dynamics that apply in many parts of Asia cannot be
extrapolated to the African continent. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first large-scale
analysis of bride price dynamics in Africa and the first study that is interested in the relationship
between bride price payments and fertility decisions in general and in rural Africa in particular.

For the purpose of this study, we employ a unique dataset of married couples from rural Senegal
consisting of 2241 observations. The data were collected in two survey rounds in 2009 and 2011 as
part of a gender and female empowerment module of a larger survey on rural infrastructure develop-
ment in Senegal. The dataset is representative for rural Senegal in seven out of 14 regions and allows
us to quantify the effect of the bride price on the number of children a woman gives birth to.
Employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Poisson regressions controlling for region and marriage
cohort effects, we find a negative relationship between bride price payments and the number of
children indicating that women who receive a higher bride price have fewer children. At the mean
bride price, a woman reduces her number of children by 0.55. The main dynamic stems from the
difference in birth outcomes of those women receiving only a symbolic bride price and those
representing the top 5 per cent of the bride price distribution. Their difference in realised fertility is
about 0.2 children. This is a small but robust difference indicating that bride price payments have a
lasting implication on the life of women. We also address potential endogeneity bias stemming from
omitted variables by controlling for income and wealth dynamics. Simultaneity bias is accounted for
by including measures of bargaining power of both husband and wife at the time of the marriage.
Measurement error in the recall of the bride price is controlled for by including the mean bride price
between 2009 and 2011, instead of the actually reported values in every year. We demonstrate that our
findings are not driven by these sources of bias. Furthermore, we carry out a detailed heterogeneity
analysis by exploring various variables through which the marriage payments influence the fertility
decisions such as the age of the bride at marriage, the age difference between husband and wife,
income generating activities of the wife, the type of union (polygamy) and distance to the couple’s
parents.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the existing literature. A
simple theoretical framework of the link between bride price payments and fertility outcomes is
presented in Section 3. In Section 4 we present the study context and the data. Section 5 introduces
the empirical strategy and the main results. Sources of endogeneity and corresponding robustness
checks are discussed in Section 6. Heterogeneous effects are presented in Section 7. Section 8
concludes and presents the implications of our results.

2. Background on Marriage Payments and Fertility Decisions

Family and marriage dynamics have first been extensively studied in economics by Becker (1981).
Becker’s model of marriage rests upon the equilibrium of a matching exercise, which fits men and
women together as couples. This assortative mating model can explain the existence of dowries and
bride price payments. The latter arises particularly in polygynous societies where women are relatively
scarce. These payments allow, for example, to differentiate between single and divorced women with the
former being more highly valued on the marriage market (Goldschmidt, 1974; Papps, 1980). Thus,
Becker views the bride price payment as an investment. According to his analysis, bride price payments
are forfeited if husbands divorce their wives without cause. This explains why husbands have an
incentive to maintain the social contract they have engaged in. Wives, in turn, have to repay their ex-
husbands if they leave them for no reason (Kaye, Mirembe, Bantebya, Ekstrom, & Johansson, 2005).
Marriage payments are a known concept in almost all societies. Although they are hardly ever
practiced in the West, they are still prominent in many developing countries (Anderson, 2007). To
date, most of the studies about marriage payments have been carried out in South Asia. In this region,
marriage payments are mostly found in the form of dowries meaning that the bride’s parents give the
marriage payment to the groom. Several studies in the literature analyse the relationship between
dowry payments and various other factors such as the surplus of women in the marriage market (Rao,
1993), the caste system (Anderson, 2003), domestic violence (Srinivasan & Bedi, 2007), female
human capital endowment (Sharma & Frijters, 2009) and family planning (Peters, 2011).

Most African countries base the marriage contract upon bride price payments instead of dowries.1 A
plethora of reasons for this difference in marriage systems has been discussed (Botticini & Siow,

Bride price and fertility 893

2003): first, Africa is characterised by collective rights that prevent a dowry system from evolving
since possibilities for parents to transfer individual wealth to their children are limited. Second, Africa
has a non-plough agricultural system where female labour is more important than in the plough
agricultural system that exists in Asia (Boserup, 1970). Such a system of agricultural production limits
the possibilities to introduce dowries and bequests. Third, dowries are found in monogamous societies
whereas African societies have a polygynous structure (Bergstrom, 1994; Tertilt, 2005).

In recent years, the economics of bride price systems have received increasing attention. For
instance, it has been shown that higher bride price payments do not influence the behaviour of
husbands towards their wives whereas higher dowries do (Zhang & Chan, 1999). Kaye et al. (2005)
similarly argue that bride price payments in Uganda enhance the social status of women, but due to the
economic dependence of women on their husbands they cannot expect less domestic violence. In a
different study using Ugandan data, Bishai and Grossbard (2010) interpret the bride price as the
women’s sexual fidelity to men because this marriage payment is associated with a lower rate of extra-
marital sexual relationships for women, yet not so for men. In the specific case of Senegal, Gaspart and
Platteau (2010), Platteau and Gaspart (2007) show that the value of the bride price is determined not
only by a woman’s socio-economic characteristics but also by strategic behaviour by herself and her
parents. The bride and her altruistic parents can prefer a (relatively) low bride price in the case of a
love marriage or to reduce the risk of ill-treatment and failure of the marriage. Yet, the persistence of
the bride price system even under changing socio-economic conditions has been documented for the
case of Indonesia and Zambia where females with a higher level of education upon marriage results in
higher bride prices (Ashraf, Bau, Nunn, & Voena, 2015).

The ancient practice of bride price payments is performed in many sub-Saharan African countries.2
In the specific case of Senegal, the value of the bride price is determined in negotiations between the
two families. The bargaining process preceding a marriage may only involve the couple or may even
take into consideration the advice given by the extended family. Before the actual marriage celebra-
tion, several consultative visits and mutual invitations take place between the future spouses and/or
close family members. To conclude this period of negotiations, the bride’s parents have to choose a
date for the marriage ceremony and announce the desired value of the bride price. This bride price can
be composed of cash and material goods such as furniture and jewels. Moreover, most Senegalese are
Muslims and according to Islamic law, a minimum amount is necessary to validate the marriage.
However, this amount is low enough to be only of symbolic value (less than 23 Euros). It is common
practice that people pay a higher bride price than that which is required by their religion. The bride
price is given to the bride and her family. In this context it is impossible to disentangle which share of
the marriage payment goes to the bride herself and which share her family keeps (Horne et al., 2013).3
Moreover, in sub-Saharan African countries bride price payments result from tribal traditions and are
practiced regardless of religious affiliations; Muslims as well as Christians adhere to these traditions.
As the bride price that exceeds the amount set by Islamic law is not fixed, its precise amount depends
on the appreciation of the bride by her family and in-laws, the bride’s socio-economic conditions, her
relative bargaining power, the prestige of both families as well as customary law. In the extreme case,
the bride price payment asked for by the girl’s family might be prohibitively high to prevent the union
with an unpopular man. In a different context, the girl’s family might abstain from any claim for
altruistic reasons. As the actual negotiation is a dynamic process that depends upon the socio-
economic conditions of the two families,
the value of the realised bride price payment varies
considerably across couples.

Next to the literature on marriage dynamics in developing countries this paper also draws upon the
literature on the fertility transition and factors that shape fertility preferences and decisions. Over
recent decades we see a global decline in fertility (United Nations, 2015). Female education has been
identified as an important driver for the fertility transition (Baird, Chirwa, McIntosh, & Özler, 2010;
Baird, McIntosh, & Özler, 2011; Drèze & Murthi, 2001; Fafchamps & Shilpi, 2014; Osili & Long,
2008). It is suggested that the fertility reducing effect of education works through delayed marriage
and birth of the first child (Marchetta & Sahn, 2016) as well as increased female labour market
participation (Bbaale, 2011). For Senegal, existing evidence points to delayed marriage and

894 L. M. Mbaye and N. Wagner

motherhood but findings about labour market participation are mixed. A study by Beguy (2009)
suggests that women’s participation in the labour market is not associated with a decline in fertility in
the city of Dakar. In turn, in rural, northern Senegal an increase in female off-farm labour due to a
boom in horticulture exports led to a lower fertility rate (Van den Broeck & Maertens, 2015).

Next to education, there is widespread agreement that social norms regulate fertility across societies
and changes of these norms due to shocks, social programmes and over time can lead to fertility
transitions. One such change in social norms, such as the introduction of contraceptives, has been
studied by Munshi and Myaux (2006). The open question that the study at hand addresses is related to
the social norm of bride price payments, which is deeply embedded in Senegalese culture. We assess
whether the amount of the bride price influences the fertility pressure on women and along which
channels. To answer this question, we start with a simple theoretical model of a husband’s demand for
a wife and children.

3. Theoretical Framework

We set up a basic, static model depicting the relationship between bride price payments and realised
fertility. In line with anthropological evidence we argue that with the full payment of the bride price a
woman loses her reproductive autonomy and subordinates her fertility preferences to the husband
(Horne et al., 2013). Then, every man in a traditional society maximises the following utility function:

U ¼ UðW ; N Wð

Þ; CÞ

(1)

where W denotes the direct utility from being married. This contains the services a wife provides
for her husband, such as taking care of the household, and her level of education but also less
tangible traits such as her beauty and her reputation within the local community. This builds on
existing evidence that the amount of the bride price reflects a woman’s socio-economic character-
istics (Gaspart and Platteau, 2010; Horne et al., 2013; Platteau and Gaspart, 2007). The second
component entering male utility is his number of children, which is a function of a woman’s traits
W. Building on existing anthropological evidence we argue that men in traditional societies aim for
large families as it increases their standing within the community (Caldwell & Caldwell, 1990). A
priori, we remain agnostic about the relationship between a woman’s traits W and the number of
children.4 Lastly, men derive utility from a composite consumption good. We impose the standard
assumption that utility is increasing in all its factors at a decreasing rate, that is Ui > 0 and Uii < 0
for i = W, N, C.

A man wants to maximise utility subject to his budget constraint:

I ¼ pW W þ pN N Wð

Þ þ pC;

where I is the combined income from all sources. The income is used to come up with the marriage
payment with the bride price being captured by pW, the costs of raising a child as denoted by pN and
the costs of consumption p. The costs of raising a child contain expenditures for nutrition, health care,
and the time devoted to the child.5 The price associated with the composite consumption good is set
to 1.

From the maximisation we obtain the following expression for the relationship between a woman’s

traits and her number of children:

¼ UW   pW UC
pN UC   UN

dN
dW

0

<

(2)

This expression together with the budget constraint allow us to draw two conclusions about the impact
of the bride price on the number of children: first, for a given level of income I a man has to reduce the

Bride price and fertility 895

number of children in response to a marriage with an ‘expensive’ bride, for whom he pays pw. This is
the income effect. Second, from Equation (2) we obtain that an increase in the bride price increases the
dW < 0 suggesting that women with more ‘expensive’ traits want a smaller number of
probability that dN
children. Based on the literature about the fertility transition and the impact of education on fertility we
refer to this latter effect as the education effect, which has already been observed by Ashraf et al.
(2015).

In this admittedly simple model we have only considered the role of women as perceived by men.
However, by making the number of children dependent on a woman’s traits we implicitly model a
woman’s bargaining power, which is low for women whose traits are not valued by the husband.
Concomitantly, an increase in female bargaining power will result in a decreasing fertility pressure as
the woman is more valued for who she is as captured by W. Thus, whenever the groom pays a high
bride price, he demonstrates his willingness to treat his wife well and to avoid the risk of divorce,
which would correspond to a financial failure of his investment. In consequence, a husband who has
paid a higher bride price gives more independence to his wife by reducing the pressure on her to
produce offspring. Put differently, a lower bride price reduces a woman’s bargaining power in the
household, which in turn increases the fertility pressure on her.6

Our model is a simple formalisation of the evidence provided by Beegle et al. (2001) showing for
the case of Indonesia that the more assets a woman owns, the bigger her say on fertility decisions. In
what follows we will empirically disentangle if, controlling for income, higher bride prices imply a
reduction in realised fertility.

4. Survey Context and Data

4.1. The Survey
Data are provided by a household survey carried out in rural areas of seven regions of Senegal.7 The
survey was part of the programme evaluation of a rural electrification initiative by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) known as multifunctional platform. The dataset includes two
waves: the baseline survey was carried out between May and July 2009 and the second survey
between April and June 2011. Villages were randomly selected based on the criterion of not having
access to the national grid, which is not a severely restricting criterion as the overall rural electrifica-
tion rate was only roughly above 20 per cent in 2008 including off-grid solutions (Mawhood & Gross,
2014). Within the villages, households were also selected at random from the list of resident house-
holds supplied by the head of the village. The sample can therefore be considered representative for
rural Senegal in seven out of 14 regions, in which subsistence agriculture is the most prevalent form of
income generation.

For the purpose of our analysis, we restrict the sample to married individuals at the time of the
survey, who responded to the gender questionnaire. Consequently, we establish an unbalanced panel
of married couples, which allows us to compare the dynamics of marriage payments across regions.
While at the household level we have a balanced panel, at the level of the individual couple it is
unbalanced. This is because within a household the same couple was not necessarily interviewed
during both survey rounds. We employ a dataset that consists of 2241 responses by married couples,
with repeated observations for 58.19 per cent of the sample. Put differently, 1304 of the observations
in our sample represent 652 couples that were interviewed twice. The remaining 937 couples were
interviewed once either in 2009 or in 2011. The subsample of repeated observations at the couple
level shows that the amount of the bride price recalled by the same woman can differ from one
survey round to the next. We exploit the variation in women’s declaration about their bride price to
address recall bias, which is a novel aspect of this study that has not yet been addressed in the
literature.

4.2. Descriptive Statistics

We present summary statistics in Table 1. The ethnic and socio-economic composition of the
sample underlines the representativeness of the dataset. An important majority of households
declare their ethnic group as being Wolof (43%), Pular (24%) or Serere (18%). Moreover, almost
one fifth of the households are casted8 and 42 per cent of the couples report living in a polygamous
union.

Household ownership of farmland, durable goods and livestock is reported by 86 per cent, 89 per
cent and 93 per cent of households, respectively. On average, households own 2.51 plots of arable land
indicating that they are in agriculture and derive their living from farming. In order to capture the
economic conditions at the time of the marriage, we build five cohorts derived from the difference

Notes: Pooled summary statistics for the survey years 2009 and 2011. The total number of observations is
2241. The reference group for the ethnicity is Wolof. The reference group for the year of marriage cohort is
the cohort [25, .].

Bride price and fertility 897

between the year of the survey and the year of marriage. For instance, the year of marriage cohort [0, 5[
is an indicator variable equal to one if the marriage was celebrated less than five years before the survey.
The year of marriage cohort [5, 10[ codes for women who were married between five and 10 years
before the survey. We further construct the year of marriage cohorts [10, 15[, [15, 20[ and [25,.] by
following the same logic; 13 per cent of the marriages were celebrated between 0 and 5 years before the
survey.

At the level of the individual couple we derive most information from the woman’s questionnaire.
Women have on average 5.20 children. This number includes children who are alive and those who
have died. The average woman is almost 37 years old. Considering the span of reproductive age is 15–
49 years old, which is applied by the Demographic and Health Surveys, the average woman has
already completed almost two-thirds of her reproductive life. Thus, we have a considerable share of
women in the sample with (almost) completed fertility profiles. Nevertheless, in the empirical analysis
we will control for current age and age at marriage. Moreover, the sampled women are on aver-
age14 years younger than their husbands. This gender age gap is not surprising in rural Senegal and
gives an indication of the timing of marriages and the underlying marriage market processes: men first
need to acquire the necessary assets to set up a family. The bride price paid at the wedding constitutes
a non-negligible part of these assets. From our survey we have detailed self-reported bride price
information reflecting the complete amount of the bride price that was paid. While the average bride
price in the sample is FCFA 240,917 (367 Euros), there is considerable variation and the mean is
driven by some large amounts as the median of FCFA 75,000 (114 Euros) shows.9 All bride prices are
denoted in nominal terms. Our analysis shares this feature with a similar study by Gaspart and Platteau
(2010) who also had to rely on nominal values.

Women marry young as the average age at first marriage indicates; they are below 18 years of age
on average. Similarly to the anthropological literature discussed above, we find that women’s position
is weak: only 16 per cent of women know how to read and write, whereas 44 per cent of their
husbands are alphabetised. Yet, almost 47 per cent of the women in the sample are economically active
beyond household chores and family farm work and 91 per cent of men pursue additional economic
activities. At the time of their marriage, some 14 and 16 per cent of women own livestock and durable
goods, respectively. A relatively low share of women (7%) have had an occupation before getting
married while this proportion is as high as 45 per cent for men. Women’s subordinate position is also
demonstrated with respect to their living arrangements. Women live close to their in-laws since on
average the couples live only 2.55 kilometres away from the husband’s parents. This distance is
estimated at 20 kilometres for the woman’s parents. This last pair of descriptive statistics represents
virilocality in the rural communities where wives have to take care of their parents-in-law and the
domestic activities in the in-laws’ home. Last, but not least, these descriptive statistics also show that
the majority of couples come from the same region as indicated by the relatively short distances to the
parents in general.

Overall, summary statistics leave no doubt that the sample at hand represents rural villages in
Senegal, in which women are in a considerably weaker position in terms of education and (economic)
empowerment compared to men.

5. Econometric Framework and Main Results

5.1. Empirical Strategy

We set up a linear model for the theoretically derived link between bride price payments and fertility
decisions to empirically analyse whether realised fertility is indeed a function of the bride price along
with other female and overall socio-economic characteristics. We specify the model in terms of its
conditional mean:

where the subscript i denotes wife, h household, t year and r region. The dependent variable yihrtis the
number of children a woman has given birth to at the moment of the survey. It is conditioned on all
right-hand side variables, which are collected in Conditionihrt. The variable of interest is the logarithm
of the bride price log(BP)ihrt. More specifically, we use log(1 + BP)ihrt to take into account amounts of
bride price equal to zero. We also control for the socio-demographic characteristics of the women Wihrt
such as contemporaneous age and its square, the age of the women at her current marriage and its
square, and a binary variable equal to one if the women is literate. The variable literacy is used to
proxy for the education level. Similarly, we control for the husband’s characteristics Hihrt such as his
age and its square, and a binary variable equal to one if he is literate. In addition, we take into account
household characteristics HHhr by controlling for ethnicity and caste as well as the type of marriage
practiced.10 The marriage form is captured by an indicator variable coding for polygamous unions. We
further control for household wealth by including the number of plots owned by the household.

In addition, we include µt in our basic regression model to capture year of marriage cohort fixed
effects. Economic conditions at the time of the marriage are considered as underlying factors that can
influence both the amount of the bride price and the ensuing number of children. In order to deal with
this source of omitted variable bias, we include year of marriage cohort fixed effects. Controlling for
the marriage cohorts allows us to take into account positive or negative shocks such as weather events
that prevailed around the wedding period and economic variables such as the level of prices.
Furthermore, we need to control for marriage cohort fixed effects as all bride prices are denoted in
nominal terms. Alternatively, we could have included information about the inflation history of
Senegal but since this information is at the national level and does not change within marriage cohort,
we opted for cohort-fixed effects. Gaspart and Platteau (2010) in their analysis of bride price dynamics
face the same problem and present a detailed discussion of the evolution of bride prices over time.
Moreover, our data highlight that the recalled bride price information is susceptible to recall bias and
reported relative to current conditions. Therefore, controlling for inflation at the time of marriage
would not necessarily do justice to the data.

We employ five-year windows for the cohorts to rule out any impact of the economic context at the
beginning of the marriage on both the bride price negotiations and the initial fertility decisions. Finally,
regional heterogeneity is controlled for by including region fixed effects λr in Equation (4). Standard
errors are clustered at the regional level to account for intra-cluster correlations.

While the linear fixed effects model is our benchmark model, we also employ a fixed effects
Poisson model as robustness test. The Poisson model better encompasses our outcome variable,
number of children, which is a count variable that is censored at zero and skewed to the right. The
conditional mean of the Poisson model is defined as follows:

where the variables are the same as described above. Since coefficient estimates from the linear model
and the Poisson model differ by construction, we assess the robustness of the OLS coefficient
estimates relative to the comparable marginal effects from the Poisson model.

Moreover, endogeneity is a key concern in our analysis. First, it is important to disentangle between
the income or wealth effect and the bride price effect on the number of children while at the same time
income and wealth are considered endogenous themselves. However, even if these variables tend to be
endogenous, by not controlling for them we may introduce omitted variable bias. Therefore, we
compare our results with and without income variables. At the very least, it allows us to see whether
our findings are robust to their inclusion. As we do not have detailed information on income, we have
to use proxy variables. A primary candidate to proxy for income is the number of plots owned by the
household. We believe that this variable is a good proxy for permanent income and can be considered
exogenous due to the lack of active land markets in rural Senegal. In addition, land is considered as a
suitable wealth indicator because inheritance is patrilineal in rural Senegal. However, a concern is
whether the number of plots is a good predictor of wealth that controls for income adequately.

Bride price and fertility 899

Therefore, we use alternative measures of income such as ownership of durable goods and livestock to
challenge the robustness of our results to the introduction of these variables.

Second, the year of marriage cohort fixed effects help us to address another source of endogeneity
introduced by measurement error in the amount of bride price due to the recall nature of the data. As
with all analyses that employ recall data we face the challenge that human memories are adaptive. It is
likely that the precise amount of the bride price is not correctly expressed by the interviewed women.
These variations in the amount can be due to the duration between the year of the survey and the year
of the marriage. Although we address the potential measurement error in the recalled amount of the
bride price by including year of marriage cohort dummies, we further use an alternative specification,
which considers the mean bride price between 2009 and 2011.

Third, by including region fixed effects, we can rule out sources of bias stemming from regional

characteristics that are common across couples residing in a particular area.

A fourth source of endogeneity is simultaneity bias arising from the fact that both bride price
payments and the number of children are driven by the bargaining power of the bride. We control for
the bargaining power of both husband and wife at the time of the marriage by including a proxy of the
husband’s income and the assets of the bride at the time of marriage.

Lastly, to gain a more precise picture of the differential impact of bride price payments we carry out a
heterogeneity analysis with respect to five variables: (i) the age of the bride at the time of the marriage, (ii) the
age difference between husband and wife, (iii) the income generating activities (IGA) of the wife, (iv) the type
of union (polygamy) and (v) the distance to the couple’s parents. We allow the coefficient associated with
bride price to vary with these different sets of variables and split the sample between these categories. We
replace log BPð
with j being
equal to any of the five variables, for which we assess heterogeneous effects. Consequently, we report the
interaction term of bride price with these different categories of variables and directly interpret the differences
in coefficient estimates by means of the F-test. Since we interact both categories (Dummyihrtj ¼ 1 and
Dummyihrtj ¼ 0) with bride price, the bride price itself is no longer directly included in the regressions as this
would result in perfect multicollinearity.

5.2. Main Results

The main results are presented in Table 2 and clearly show that the bride price is negatively related to
the number of children.

We start the analysis by assessing a simple correlation between bride price and the number of
children. In Column 1 of Table 2, the OLS framework yields a significant (α = 5%) and negative
coefficient associated with the log bride price payment, namely −0.164. Column 2 of Table 2 shows
the results with regional and year of marriage cohort fixed effects. The coefficient associated with
bride price remains significant and negative. Yet, the magnitude and the size of the coefficient is lower
as compared to Column 2 indicating that the overall economic conditions around the wedding play a
role in ensuing fertility decisions. In addition to these fixed effects, we control for wife and husband
characteristics, polygamy, ethnicity and caste and confirm the significant (α = 5%) and negative
relationship between bride price and the number of children (Column 3 of Table 2). The coefficient is
−0.044 indicating that at the mean bride price of FCFA 240,917 a woman gives birth to 0.55 children
less. At the median bride price, a woman has 0.49 children less on average. Put differently, every other
woman who receives a bride price between the median and the mean value of our sample compared to
a woman who does not receive a marriage payment, gives birth to one child less. While the effects
seem to be large at first glance, they need to be qualified relative to the model we employ. The main
dynamic stems from the difference in birth outcomes of those women receiving only a symbolic bride
price of up to FCFA 10,000 or less, which make up for the bottom 5 per cent, and the top 5 per cent,
which receive a bride price of FCFA 650,000 and above. Their difference in realised fertility is about
0.2 children. This is a small but robust difference that is found across all specifications and consistent
with the theoretical model. Given that the bride price is paid at the beginning of the marriage and is a

sunk cost at the time of child bearing, this early marriage decision has a considerable long-term
impact.

We have not yet accounted for wealth in the analysis although assets and wealth clearly influence
both bride price payments and fertility decisions. Therefore, we include the number of plots owned in
Column 4 of Table 2. This does not affect the coefficient associated with bride price (compare Column
3 of Table 2). At the same time, the wealth effect is non-negligible and is represented by the positive
impact that the number of plots has on realised fertility. The coefficient is twice as big as the one
associated with the bride price indicating the importance of contemporaneous income streams for
raising children. Moreover, this positive effect associated with land also has to be understood as a
demand for labour, as households owning more farmland need more hands to work on it (Jacoby,
1995).

As the analysis is an ex post analysis of realised fertility at the time of the survey and we rely on
contemporaneously observed fertility outcomes, we control for the age of the husband and wife as well
as their age at marriage. Unsurprisingly, older women have given birth to more children but this
relationship is non-linear. The turning point is at the age of 55, which roughly corresponds to the
average age of natural menopause according to medical research (McKinlay, 1996). At the same time,

Bride price and fertility 901

we observe that the younger a bride was at her marriage, the more children she has given birth to at the
date of the survey. However, the relationship between the age at marriage and the fertility decisions is
U-shaped with 32 years marking the threshold. Since the average woman in our survey is 37 years old,
our analysis seems to be a valid representation of the fertility-age dynamics. Similarly, literacy has the
expected negative sign showing that more educated women tend to have fewer children. Yet, the
coefficient associated with literacy is not significant.

While we do not find any significant differences in fertility patterns across castes, the ethnic group
of the Serere tends to have one more child on average. This result has also been found in the
Demographic and Health Surveys and confirms the representativeness of our dataset for rural
Senegal (see the Appendix for the full set of results of Table 2). As motivated above, the Poisson
model might be more suited for the analysis as our dependent variable is a count variable. We
employ the Poisson model akin to the linear model. Marginal effects are presented in Column 5–8 of
Table 2 and show identical results. Therefore, in the remainder of the paper we only present the OLS
results.

Turning to the impact of the covariates on fertility decisions, the contextual dimension of both
marriage arrangements and ensuing family planning is emphasised. The analysis demonstrates that the
individual characteristics of husband and wife and the timing of their marriage jointly shape fertility
decisions. In what follows, we test the robustness of our results by considering various sources of
endogeneity. We also look at the extent to which the characteristics of the couple are linked to bride
price payments. By carrying out a differential analysis we improve our understanding of the institu-
tional settings of the marriage market in rural Senegal.

6. Endogeneity Bias and Robustness Checks

In our econometric approach we use the detailed information provided by the household survey
and control for the characteristics of the couple and the household. We rule out sources of biases
that possibly come from time-invariant regional characteristics and trends in bride price through
the region and the marriage-year cohort fixed effects. Although we pay attention to all these
elements, we may still face endogeneity problems due to the omission of relevant variables such as
income.

6.1. Omitted Variable Bias

One concern related to the use of the number of plots as a measure for wealth is that a household with
one large plot can be richer than a household with many small plots. To address this, we replace the
variable number of plots with a dummy taking the value 1 if the household owns any land (Column 1
of Table 3). The coefficient associated with bride price remains significant and negative and of
identical magnitude as before. The ownership of land is insignificant.

We further disentangle the income from the bride price effect by including income generating
activities (IGA) undertaken by the wife and the husband in our empirical specification jointly with
the number of plots and two additional dummy variables equal to 1 if the household owns durable
goods or livestock, respectively. By including IGAs, we control for the labour market participation
of women and men. We construct two indicator variables, the first variable is binary and equal to
one if the wife is economically active, the second one is similarly constructed for economically
active husbands. The coefficient associated with the bride price remains negative and significant,
although at the 10 per cent level (Column 2 of Table 3). The magnitude of the coefficient is
smaller probably due to the demanding specification. We observe that income-generating activities
by the wife increase her number of children while such activities by the husband have no impact
on fertility decisions. This result demonstrates that women provide most of the resources for

raising their children themselves and paternal contributions are limited (Desai, 1992). The own-
ership of durables or livestock is not significantly different from 0.

6.2. Simultaneity Bias

A second concern is simultaneity bias since it is female bargaining power that drives both bride price
and fertility decisions. Therefore, we checked the robustness of our results to the inclusion of variables
that proxy for the bargaining power between husband and wife at the time of the marriage. In Column
3 of Table 3, we control for labour market participation of the husband before getting married and the
economic activity of the woman before getting married. To further capture the bargaining power of
women, we add dummy variables for her ownership of livestock and durable goods at the time of
marriage. The results are robust to the inclusion of these variables. Moreover, a husband with an

occupation before getting married and a wife with durable goods at the time of marriage reduce their
number of children.

6.3. Bias from Measurement Error

the average bride price in 2009 is different

Although we control for the economic conditions at the time of the marriage, we want to make sure
that the measurement error resulting from the recall of the bride price does not invalidate our
results. We note that
from the one in 2011.
Consequently, we implement an alternative specification that uses the log of the mean bride
price between 2009 and 2011 instead of the actually reported values in every year. In Column 4
of Table 3, the relationship between the mean bride price and the number of children is shown to
be similarly negative and significant. The magnitude of the coefficient is higher in absolute terms
when we use the mean bride price rather than the values reported for every period. However, we
prefer being conservative in assessing the magnitudes and focus on the results in Table 2, which
are lower in absolute terms.

6.4. Other Robustness Checks

For about half of the couples, we have two observations. In order to make sure that it does not affect
our results, we include a dummy for the repeated observations and the results do not change (Column
5 of Table 3).

All our estimates are clustered at the region level. However, given the small number of regions, a
simple clustering of standard errors can underestimate them. Following Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller
(2011), we present in Column 6 of Table 3 the main result controlling for multi-way clustered standard
errors. The latter option allows us to account for the small number of clusters by implementing Wild
boostrapping. The results remain statistically significant at the 5 per cent level.

7. Heterogeneous Effects

To gain a more precise picture of the differential impact of bride price payments we consider
heterogeneous effects. We report the interaction term of bride price with five different categories of
variables. We allow the coefficient associated with bride price to vary with these different sets of
variables and split the sample between these categories. The coefficient estimates are directly inter-
preted by means of the F-test. Since we interact both categories with bride price the latter is no longer
directly included in the regressions as this would result in perfect multicollinearity.

7.1. Age at Marriage and Age Difference Between Husband and Wife
First of all, we consider the woman’s age at the time of the marriage. We split the sample into brides
below and above 20 years of age at the time of their marriage (Column 1 of Table 4). At first glance,
results suggest that there is a difference between older and younger women in the relationship between
bride price payments and pressure for offspring. However, the F -test of 20.34 per cent reveals that the
dynamics and expectations linked to the bride price are similar for women who get married very young
(below the age of 20) and at a slightly older age (above the age of 20). We also tried other thresholds
for the age of marriage subsamples. The results did not change.

Bride price dynamics can be further nuanced by analysing the nature of the marriage, namely an
arranged versus a love marriage. While we cannot directly control for these two types of marriage, we
have information on the age difference between husband and wife. By controlling for the age
difference of the couple, we build on anthropological evidence that
in rural Senegal arranged
marriages between young girls and older men are not uncommon (Foley & Drame, 2013). In
Column 2 of Table 4, we present the results controlling for age difference and its interaction with

Bride price and fertility 905

the bride price payment. We find a direct effect of age difference: the bigger the difference is, the more
pressure the woman has to give birth. Yet, there is a threshold at which a higher age difference
decreases the number of children. When the age gap exceeds 23 years, fertility is decreasing again. In
addition to including the age difference, we interact the bride price payments with a dummy variable
equal to one if the age difference is higher than 10 years. The interaction term further reinforces the
finding that higher bride prices reduce the number of children a woman has to give birth to in arranged
marriages. The coefficient is similar in size and significance to the one found in the main model
(Column 2 of Table 2). The interaction between bride price payments and (almost) no age difference is
not statistically significant. This term, which represents a marriage between individuals of similar age,
is considered to code for marriages out of mutual affection. In love marriages, bride price payments are
not needed to regulate fertility decisions taken by the couple. Yet, for arranged marriages, in which a
considerably older husband has chosen a young girl, the bride price is decisive for the woman’s
pressure for offspring (p-value of the F -test 4.65%). In this type of marriage, if the bride and her
family can negotiate a substantial payment for her, she will face less pressure for reproductive success.

7.2. Income Generating Activities of the Wife

Results in Column 3 of Table 4 show that women who are economically dependent on their husbands
while having received a low bride price tend to have more children, indicating that the concerned
women are less valued and have to gain respect through reproductive success (p-value of the F-test
5.4%). This finding highlights that economically inactive, poor women are at a considerable risk of not
being honoured with a bride price and face pressure to gain respect through offspring. Poor women
have little bargaining power to ask for high bride price payments. This limits them in their choice of a
husband and might result in less affectionate but rather affordable marriage arrangements. Being in
such a marriage of convenience puts a high reproductive pressure on them.

7.3. Polygamous Versus Monogamous Households

Being in a polygamous household increases the number of children a woman gives birth to (Column 4
of Table 4). This result comes from the competition between wives particularly with respect to
inheritance. The higher the number of children of any individual wife, the higher will be the share
she and her children inherit upon the death of the husband. For women living in a polygamous
household, a lower bride price payment increases fertility pressure while in a monogamous household
the bride price payment has no effect on the couple’s decisions concerning fertility (p-value of the
F-test 2.46%). Indirectly, this finding also supports the results about age difference: whenever a couple
is close due to affection, marriage payments have no significance and thus do not influence fertility
decisions. In turn, if a woman is just an addition, her value and appreciation is defined by the bride
price she receives.

7.4. Distance to Parents

We also examined the geographical distance between the married couple and their parents. While the
first variable has no effect on the fertility decisions of the couple, we find an inverse relationship between
the number of children and the distance to her in-laws. Put differently, women who live near their in-
laws encounter higher reproductive pressure. However, the magnitude of the coefficient is close to 0 and
despite being precisely estimated the coefficient has no economic significance (Column 5 of Table 4).
In addition, we split the sample between women living more than 20 kilometres from their parents
and those who live within a radius of 20 kilometres from their parents. We find no differential effects
with respect to the impact of bride price payments on fertility decisions (p-value of the F-test 57.55%).
However, when we compare women living far from their parents-in-law, which means that their
residence is at least located 20 kilometres from them, to those who live closer, bride price dynamics
with respect to distance appear. In response to high bride price payments, women close to their

906 L. M. Mbaye and N. Wagner

parents-in-law reduce the number of children considerably less as compared to women who live far
away from their in-laws (p-value of the F -test 3.78%). In other words, the fertility pressure is stronger
for women who receive a low bride price and live close to their in-laws compared to those who live far
from their parents-in-law. When women live close to their in-laws, they are pressured by the family
and judged according to the number of children they give birth to. Living further away from the in-
laws implies a higher level of (economic) independence and concomitantly less fertility pressure.

8. Conclusion

The bride price system has a long tradition in many sub-Saharan African countries and to this day is deeply
embedded in local cultures. This system of marriage payments has considerable implications for the
bargaining power and status of women. This paper contributes to the existing anthropological literature
suggesting that upon receipt of the full bride price payment a woman loses her reproductive autonomy
(Horne et al., 2013). The literature to date mainly assesses the role of bride price payments per se but not
whether differences in the amount of the bride price paid have differential effects on fertility. We
complement this literature with an assessment of the relationship between the size of the bride price
payment and related fertility decisions. Our econometric results suggest that a woman’s say in her marriage,
as captured by her realised fertility, is crucially influenced by the payment from the groom’s family to the
bride and her family upon the marriage. As outlined by the anthropological literature, a marriage represents
a social contract between a man and a woman and their respective families. Whenever the groom is
disposed to pay a high bride price, he demonstrates his willingness to treat his wife well and to avoid the
risk of divorce, which would correspond to a financial failure of the investment. The woman, in turn, can
judge from the bride price payment she received how much she is appreciated and whether she needs to
gain reputation within the groom’s family by giving birth to many children.

Bride price payments are not only an African phenomenon. In recent years they have gained
increasing importance in China and marriage migration for high bride prices is not uncommon
(Davin, 2005). Thus, bride prices are an important marriage market
institution that remains in
existence even as countries and regions develop.

This type of marriage contract seems odd to Western observers. Yet, in poor rural societies this
mutual insurance is prominent, covering not only the spouses but also their families. Therefore, efforts
to eradicate the tradition of bride price payments and formalise marriages according to national legal
standards might make the concerned women particularly worse off.

Already to date, bride price payments have less power over women who are economically
independent. A direct change of the bride price system might be too challenging a task. But economic
empowerment will give leeway to girls even in traditional societies. The established marriage contract
can be broken indirectly by giving women more possibilities for economic independence. Another
possible entry point to counteract the continuance of this tradition are family planning programmes.
On the one hand, our findings suggest that these programmes may be inefficient if they do not take
into account norms and values, which define women’s behaviour with regard to fertility decisions in
traditional societies. At the same time, these programmes can be used to educate women. Moreover,
family planning programmes, which are integrated in broader support structures, can offer women
opportunities to increase their (economic) independence such that the social contract that stipulates the
marriage arrangements is a tool of empowerment for young couples and also fosters marriages of
mutual affection.

Notes

1. Bride price payments are also practiced in some Asian countries such as Thailand (Cherlin & Chamratrithirong, 1988) or
rural China where it is possible to find the two systems of marriage payments to coexist (Anderson, 2007; Brown, 2009).
2. The following sub-Saharan African countries practice bride price payments: Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal,
South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. The list is non-exclusive. The mentioned countries participated in an international
conference about the system of bride price payments in Uganda in 2004.

3. It is important to keep in mind that in African societies, particularly in traditional societies, the group is more important
and valued than the individual taken on her own. Consequently, the specific share received by the bride is of minor
importance since she is initially considered as part of her family of origin. What is of importance is the transaction from
one family to another. Whenever the family of the bride receives a transfer, the bride will be considered as the one who
received the payment and was valued by her in-laws regardless of the share of the transfer that she has direct control
over.

4. In contrast, Bergstrom (1994) assumes in his model of polygamy that fertility increases in the bride price.
5. We abstain from directly modelling child health since we are only interested in child ‘quantity’ and not in ‘quality’.
6. An historical overview of marriage laws in early African societies reveals that marriage payments have not always been
perceived as ‘bride price’. According to Kanji and Camara (2000), the term ‘prenuptial gift’ is more appropriate than
bride price. Historically, marriage payments were not viewed as a price or compensation. Such transfers were of
symbolic nature and represented the engagement of the groom towards his bride and her family. Yet, these nuptial
transfers were interpreted as bride price as time evolved and the concept bride price was further shaped by tribal,
religious and political influences.

7. The regions are Diourbel, Fatick, Kaolack, Kolda, Louga, Tambacounda, and Thies. The newly established region

Kedougou is also part of the survey but is here considered as part of the region of Tambacounda.

8. Senegal has a caste system, which is historically based on labour division. The dummy caste equals 1 if households belong
to the Ñeeño, who work in handcraft jobs and music; being a member of the Geer caste is coded with 0. The latter are not
bounded by job categories (Mbow, 2000).

9. Very few bride prices are higher than FCFA 1,000,000. To avoid deleting these outliers and losing some observations, we

associate them to an amount of FCFA 1,000,000.

10. We cannot systematically disentangle lineage in the analysis since Senegalese society shifted from a matrilineal to a
patrilineal one, although matrilineal traditions still exist. Therefore, we proxy for different tribal and regional occur-
rences by including ethnicity and regional fixed effects in the analysis. Yet, even based on these indicators we are not in
a position to disentangle lineage effects since a variety of matrilineal and patrilineal
traditions are found across
Senegalese society, which cannot be clearly attributed to one tribe or another inhibiting us from assessing lineage per
se. In line with Horne et al. (2013) we argue that in both contexts, matrilineal and patrilineal societies, the marriage
payment from the groom to his wife affects the woman’s reproductive autonomy while bride price payments tend to be
lower in matrilineal societies.
