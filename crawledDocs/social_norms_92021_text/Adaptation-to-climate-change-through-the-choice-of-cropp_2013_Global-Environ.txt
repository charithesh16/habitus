Adaptation options

Multiple cropping systems provide more harvest security for farmers, allow for crop intensiﬁcation and
furthermore inﬂuence ground cover, soil erosion, albedo, soil chemical properties, pest infestation and
the carbon sequestration potential. We identify the traditional sequential cropping systems in ten sub-
Saharan African countries from a survey dataset of more than 8600 households. We ﬁnd that at least one
sequential cropping system is traditionally used in 35% of all administrative units in the dataset, mainly
including maize or groundnuts. We compare six different management scenarios and test their
susceptibility as adaptation measure to climate change using the dynamic global vegetation model for
managed land LPJmL. Aggregated mean crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa decrease by 6–24% due to
climate change depending on the climate scenario and the management strategy. As an exception, some
traditional sequential cropping systems in Kenya and South Africa gain by at least 25%. The crop yield
decrease is typically weakest in sequential cropping systems and if farmers adapt the sowing date to
changing climatic conditions. Crop caloriﬁc yields in single cropping systems only reach 40–55% of crop
caloriﬁc yields obtained in sequential cropping systems at the end of the 21st century. The farmers’
choice of adequate crops, cropping systems and sowing dates can be an important adaptation strategy to
climate change and these management options should be considered in climate change impact studies
on agriculture.

1. Introduction

The number of undernourished people remains highest in sub-
Saharan Africa compared to other world regions and population
will be more than doubled in 2050 compared to 2000 (FAO, 2006).
Among effective strategies like ﬁghting poverty, stabilizing
economies and ensure access to food, increased food production
in smallholder agriculture will be a key strategy for ﬁghting hunger
(FAO, 2008). Agricultural production can be increased by expand-
ing agricultural land and by increasing the intensiﬁcation of crop
production through higher crop yields and higher cropping
intensities. The cropping intensity in less-developed countries
can be increased by about 5–10% during the next 35 years if
adequate amounts of input are available (Do¨ o¨ s and Shaw, 1999).

Multiple cropping systems allow for this intensiﬁcation by
growing two or more crops on the same ﬁeld either at the same
time or after each other in a sequence (Francis, 1986b; Norman
et al., 1995). They already are common farming systems in tropical
agriculture today (Table 1). In multiple cropping systems the risk of
complete crop failure is lower compared to single cropping
systems and monocultures providing a high level of production
stability (Francis, 1986a). Furthermore the second crop in a
sequence may beneﬁts from an increased amount of nitrogen
derived from ﬁxation (Bationo and Ntare, 2000; Sisworo et al.,
1990) or phosphorous from deep-rooted species (Francis, 1986a)
as well as from decreased disease pressure (Bennett et al., 2012)
which helps to reduce the use of mineral fertilizer and pesticides.
Cropping intensity is not only important in terms of agricultural
production; the duration crops cover the soil will also inﬂuence
albedo, ground cover, carbon sequestration potential and soil
erosion (Keys and McConnell, 2005).
In sub-Saharan Africa,
multiple cropping systems mostly consist of cereal-legume mixed

Deﬁnition, description

A cropping system with only one crop growing on the ﬁeld (Bennett et al., 2012). Interchangeable with monoculture or continuous
cropping.
A cropping system with two crops grown on the same ﬁeld in sequence during one growing season with or without a fallow
period. A speciﬁc case is double cropping with the same crop grown twice on the ﬁeld.
A cropping system with two intercropping systems grown on the same ﬁeld in sequence during one growing season with or
without a fallow period.
The period of time from sowing to maturity determined by the sum of daily temperatures above a crop-speciﬁc temperature
threshold = phenological heat unit sum (PHU).
The period of time in which temperature and moisture conditions are suitable for crop growth, in the sub-tropical and tropical
zones determined by the start and end of the main rainy season.
-‘‘[. . .] may refer to either growing more than one crop on a ﬁeld during the same time (intercropping), after each other in a
sequence (sequential cropping) or with overlapping growing periods (relay cropping)’’ (Francis, 1986b; Norman et al., 1995).
Examples in sub-Saharan Africa are:
- groundnut–millet succession in the northern part of central Africa (de Schlippe, 1956)
- wheat–chickpea succession in Ethiopia (Berrada et al., 2006)
- maize double cropping in western Nigeria (Francis, 1986b)
- cowpea–maize sequence cropping in the moist Savannah zone of northern Nigeria (Carsky et al., 2001)
- soybean and wheat sequences in Zimbabwe (Beets, 1982)
- sorghum and pigeonpea in northern Nigeria (Francis, 1986a)
- sorghum double cropping in southern Guinea and Savannah zones of West Africa (Kowal and Kassam, 1978)

cropping dominated by maize, millet, sorghum and wheat (Van
Duivenbooden et al., 2000). Maize- and cassava-based mixed
cropping systems are common in humid East and West Africa,
whereas millet-based mixed cropping is widely applied in dry East
and West Africa (Francis, 1986b). Intercropping is the traditional
and most frequently applied multiple cropping system in sub-
Saharan Africa, however sequential cropping and mixed sequential
cropping systems are also common indigenous management
practices (Table 1).

Agricultural activities and consequently the livelihoods of
people reliant on agriculture will be affected by changes in
temperature and precipitation conditions in large parts of sub-
Saharan Africa (Boko et al., 2007; Christensen et al., 2007; Mu¨ ller
et al., 2011). Under climate change, many areas in sub-Saharan
Africa are likely to experience a decrease in the length of the
growing season, while in some highland areas rainfall changes may
lead to a prolongation of the growing season (Thornton et al.,
2006). The degree of climate change impacts on agricultural
production differs between crops (Challinor et al., 2007; Liu et al.,
2008; Schlenker and Lobell, 2010; Thornton et al., 2011) and
agricultural systems (Thornton et al., 2010). Therefore the farmers’
choice of an adequate cropping system and crop cultivar, especially
in precipitation-limited areas, might be an important adaptation
strategy to changing climate conditions (O’Brien et al., 2000;
Thomas et al., 2007). Lobell et al. (2008) note that the identiﬁcation
of practicable adaptation strategies for cropping systems should be
prioritized for regions impacted by climate change. However, few
studies investigate the impact of climate change on agriculture in
sub-Saharan Africa considering the cropping system applied or
make an effort to identify the least impacted cropping systems. The
study of Thornton et al. (2009) is an exception, analysing crop yield
response to climate change of a maize–bean cropping sequence in
East Africa under which beans grow in a separate second growing
season.

Analysing different multiple cropping systems in a climate
impact study for sub-Saharan Africa requires a dataset reporting
their spatial distribution in the region, which to our knowledge is
not available. Some crop calendars available at
the global
(Portmann et al., 2010; Sacks et al., 2010) or African scale (FAO,
2010) report the growing periods of individual crops but lack
reporting calendars for multiple cropping systems, while some
others only cover Asian regions (Frolking et al., 2002, 2006). Fischer
et al. (2002) identiﬁed potential double and triple cropping zones
by comparing temperature and moisture requirements of four crop

groups with climatic conditions worldwide. Thornton et al. (2006)
developed a classiﬁcation for agricultural systems in Africa by
combining a global livestock production classiﬁcation system, a
farming system classiﬁcation, and global land cover maps. Both
datasets do not report the crop cultivars or the cropping systems.
The knowledge about the spatial distribution of multiple
cropping systems needs to be expanded by more detailed
information on the sub-national level. We analyse a household
survey (Dinar et al., 2008) carried out in 385 districts and provinces
containing more than 8600 households in ten countries of sub-
Saharan Africa to ﬁll this gap. From this survey we are able to
identify the traditional rainfed sequential cropping systems with
two crops grown within one year. As these are advantageous
management strategies because they allow for risk spreading and
increased crop productivity, we test their susceptibility to future
climatic conditions in comparison to alternative management
strategies by simulating crop yields with the dynamic global
vegetation model for managed land LPJmL (Bondeau et al., 2007).
We analyse the ability of each management strategy to maximize
future crop productivity or lower negative impacts from climate
change on crops. We perform this analysis in locations where
sequential cropping systems are already applied by local farmers
today and also for the entire region of sub-Saharan Africa in order
to estimate potential beneﬁts.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Input data for current and future climate data

To describe current climatic conditions, we used time series of
monthly temperature and precipitation as well as the number of
wet days from the climate database CRU TS 3.0 (Mitchell and Jones,
2005) for the 30-year period 1971–2000 on a spatial resolution of
0.58  0.58. Future climatic conditions for the 30-year period 2070–
2099 were projected from the three Global Circulation Models
(GCMs) MPI-ECHAM5 (Jungclaus et al., 2006), UKMO-HadCM3
(Cox et al., 1999), and NCAR-CCSM3 (Collins et al., 2006) as in the
World Climate Research Programme’s (WCRP’s) Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model dataset
(Meehl et al., 2007). As there is little consistency between GCM
projections on precipitation (Boko et al., 2007) they were chosen to
show a wide range of possible future precipitation patterns
without being outliers (Fig. 1). NCAR-CCSM3 is among the ‘‘wet
GCMs’’ projecting mostly increases in annual precipitation while

Fig. 1. Change in annual mean temperature and annual mean precipitation from the periods 1971–2000 to 2070–2099 projected from three GCMs under the SRES A2. Brown
and green colours in the lower three panels indicate a decrease or an increase in annual mean precipitation respectively.

MPI-ECHAM5 is among the ‘‘dry GCMs’’, projecting a strong drying
in southern Africa which is less pronounced in UKMO-HadCM3.
We choose climate projections for the SRES A2 emission scenario
as this generally shows highest average global warming of 3.4 8C
until the end of the 21st century compared to the SRES A1b and B2
(2.8 8C and 1.8 8C) which are also available in the WCRP CMIP3
dataset (Meehl et al., 2007). The monthly mean temperature and
precipitation sums from these three GCMs were interpolated to a
ﬁner spatial resolution of 0.58  0.58 using bilinear interpolation
and smoothed using a 30-year running mean. The temperature and
precipitation anomalies from each GCM were calculated relative to
the 1971–2000 average climate from CRU TS 3.0 and were then
applied to this baseline while preserving observed variability
(Gerten et al., 2011). Daily mean temperatures were obtained by
linear interpolation between mean monthly temperatures, and
daily precipitation data were provided by a weather generator
which distributes monthly precipitation to the number of observed
wet days in a month, considering the transition probabilities
between wet and dry phases (Geng et al., 1986; Gerten et al., 2004).
We kept the number of wet days constant at their average number
from the time period 1971–2000. Geng et al. (1986) conﬁrms that
the rainy days as well as the amount of precipitation generated
from this procedure are in general very close to observations in
different environments. In this analysis we keep atmospheric CO2
concentrations constant at 370 ppm. Increasing atmospheric CO2
concentrations can increase the productivity of plants (especially
C3 plants), but the effectiveness on increasing crop yields is
uncertain (Long et al., 2006; Tubiello et al., 2007) and does require
adaptation in management (Ainsworth and Long, 2005).

2.2. Household survey dataset

A subset of a household survey (Dinar et al., 2008) containing
8697 households in 10 sub-Saharan African countries (Burkina
Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Senegal, South
Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) is used to calculate the growing

periods (Table 1) of crops grown in different cropping systems. This
dataset is the product of a World Bank/Global Environmental
Facility project that was coordinated by the Centre for Environ-
mental Economics and Policy for Africa (CEEPA) at the University of
Pretoria, South Africa.

Half of the households are small-scale farmers, the other half are
medium- or large-scale farmers. Each farm type was surveyed in
each country but in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Ghana more than 80% of
the households are smallholders. In contrast, 73% of all households
in Senegal belong to a large-scale farm. The household survey
reports sowing and harvest dates from 56 crops which are grown on
up to three plots in up to three seasons within 12 months. In the
households surveyed up to six crops are grown simultaneously on a
plot. For each of these countries, data from 416 to 1087 households
in 17 to 61 representative sample units (district or province) were
collected for only one farming season (2002/2003 or 2003/2004).
Sowing and harvest dates were reported on a daily, weekly or
monthly basis and were converted into a uniform date speciﬁcation
using the day of the year. For weekly data we assumed the ﬁrst day
of the week, for monthly data the 15th day of the month is assumed.
The length of the growing period in days is derived from these daily
sowing and harvest dates for each crop. As harvest sometimes
occurs shortly after sowing but the year of sowing and harvest
events is not always reported, we assume a minimum length of 2
months for the growing period (6 months for cassava).

2.2.1. Identiﬁcation of sequential cropping systems

We identify the sequential cropping and single cropping
systems applied within one farming season in a sample unit by
combining the information of the crops’ growing periods in each
plot and season. As only nine out of 56 crops (cassava, cowpea,
groundnut, maize, millet, rice, soybean, sunﬂower, and wheat) are
included in the dynamic global vegetation model we combine the
remaining crops to a group of ‘‘other crops’’.

We assume sequential cropping systems if two crops are
reported to be planted one after another without overlaps of more

used in this study. (A) Two single cropping systems with large overlap, (B) one single cropping system, (C) two single cropping systems, one spanning the turn of the year and

than 15 days and if their growing periods sum up to less than 365
days (Fig. 2D–G) i.e. the growing period of a crop here is restricted
by the occurrence of the associated crop on the plot. In contrast, we
assume single cropping systems if only one single crop is reported
to grow on a plot (Fig. 2B) or if more than one crop is grown on a
plot but the sum of their growing periods is larger than 365 days
and/or their growing periods overlap by more than 15 days (Fig. 2C,
A), i.e. the conditions for a sequential cropping system are not met.
An overlap of 15 days corresponds to the maximum possible
error in sowing and harvest dates owing to the conversion from
monthly to daily data. We only consider rainfed systems in this
study because irrigation systems are rarely available in sub-
Saharan Africa. If various sequential cropping systems exist within
a district, we identify the most frequently applied sequential
cropping system in a district and assume this system to be the
traditionally applied sequential cropping system. Based on the
distance between the centre coordinates of the districts and those
of the 0.58  0.58 grid cells, the sequential cropping systems found
in a district are allocated to the closest grid cell. If a district covers
more than one grid cell the sequential cropping systems are
distributed to all corresponding grid cells.

2.3. Management scenarios for adaptation

Farmers choose a cropping system according to economic
market trends, consumer demands, availability of inputs such as
seeds, fertilizer and pesticides, agronomy traditions as well as
current land-use, climatic conditions and soil properties (Bennett
et al., 2012; Castellazzi et al., 2008) in order to maximize their yield
and proﬁt and/or to minimize the risk of crop failure through
diversiﬁcation. Rainy seasons long enough for growing two crops
in a sequential cropping system allow for intensiﬁcation and more
harvest security for farmers because crop yields are obtained two
or more times a year (Andrews and Kassam, 1976). If necessary,
farmers respond to perceived changes and variability in climate by
e.g. changing the sowing date of cultivated crops or switching to a
more suitable crop or crop cultivar with a different growing period,
heat tolerance or drought resistance. These strategies were already
observed in Tanzania (O’Brien et al., 2000), semi-arid West Africa
(Mation and Kristjanson, 1988), and South Africa (Benhin, 2006). It
can thus be expected that farmers will adapt their traditional
cropping system to a changing climate to some extent. We deﬁne
three management scenarios, analysing different cropping system
with the aim of comparing changes in crop yields with changing

climate of the 21st century in order to ﬁnd the most suitable
strategy:

- TS: Traditional sequential cropping system: the baseline strategy.
Farmers grow the sequential cropping system most frequently
applied in their district composed of two short-growing crop
cultivars.

- SC: Single cropping system: farmers only grow one long-growing
cultivar of the ﬁrst crop of the traditional sequential cropping
system.

- HS: Highest-yielding sequential cropping system: farmers grow
the sequential cropping system composed of two short-growing
crop cultivars with the highest yields.

Sowing dates in these scenarios change dynamically with
changes in the start of the main rainy season allowing for inter-
annual variability. In order to assess the importance of adapting
sowing dates to changing climate or weather conditions three
additional scenarios are designed in which the sowing dates are
kept constant with the simulated sowing dates in the ﬁrst
simulation year 1971.

- TSco: Traditional sequential cropping system as described above

with constant sowing dates.

- SCco: Single cropping system as described above with constant

sowing dates.

- HSco: Highest-yielding sequential cropping system as described

above with constant sowing dates.

Accordingly, each of the six management scenarios is a
combination of a speciﬁc cropping system and sowing date
setting, as these are important management options for farmers.
We assume that farmers prefer short-growing crop cultivars in
sequential cropping systems in order to reduce the risk of crop
failure in the second half of the growing season (Table 1) or,
alternatively,
long-growing crop cultivars in single cropping
systems in order to increase the yield. Sequential cropping systems
are advantageous farming systems but cannot be applied if the
growing season is too short. In this case a single cropping system
may be the most suitable cropping system. Adapting sowing dates
to shifts in the start of the rainy season ensures optimal growing
conditions and low risk of drought at important crop growth stages
and, therefore, allows for better use of rainwater and potentially
increased crop yields (Van Duivenbooden et al., 2000).

2.4. Dynamic global vegetation model for managed land LPJmL

LPJmL is a process-based global vegetation model for natural
and agricultural vegetation, simulating biophysical and biogeo-
chemical processes as well as productivity and yield of the most
important crops (Bondeau et al., 2007; Sitch et al., 2003).
Carbohydrates from photosynthesis are allocated to different crop
organs at daily time steps depending on the phenological stage of
the crop and environmental conditions. To simulate the pheno-
logical development of a crop, the heat unit theory is applied
(Bondeau et al., 2007). Heat units (in degree-days [8Cd]) are
calculated from daily temperatures above a base temperature
(Table 2) and are summed over all phenological stages (potential
heat unit sum, PHU [8Cd]). This empirically derived quantitative
measurement describes the effect of air temperature on the growth
of crops (Boswell, 1926) and reﬂects the length of a crop’s growing
period.

Temperature and water stress inﬂuence crop development and
growth (Bondeau et al., 2007). Increasing temperatures lead to a
shortened growing period because crops reach maturity earlier in
the year and crop yields potentially decrease. Stress due to extreme
temperatures does not damage the crop irreversibly in the model,
but temperatures beyond the optimal temperatures for photosyn-
thesis reduce productivity. A water stress factor is calculated from
the ratio of water supply through plant water uptake from the soil
and atmospheric water demand (Sitch et al., 2003) and inﬂuences
leaf growth (Bondeau et al., 2007). We extended this approach to
also account for changes in root growth in response to water stress
(Supporting Material A). Water stress effecting leaf and root
growth negatively might occur more frequently in the second crop
cycle because water stored in the soil was already consumed by the
preceding crop.

It is possible to simulate different crop cultivars with LPJmL for
wheat and rapeseed (spring and winter cultivar), as well as for
maize and sunﬂower (temperate and tropical cultivar) by varying
the PHU (Bondeau et al., 2007). We extend this approach by
calculating PHUs for a short-growing crop cultivar grown in
sequential cropping systems (PHUseq) and a long-growing crop
cultivar grown in single cropping systems (PHUsin) from observed
growing periods and daily temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa.
The base temperatures are taken from LPJmL (Bondeau et al.,
2007) for groundnut, millet, rice, soybean, sunﬂower and wheat
and from SWAT (Neitsch et al., 2002) for cassava, cowpea and
maize (Table 2).

The start of the growing season in subtropical and tropical
environments is determined by the start of the main rainy season

and is simulated dynamically in LPJmL from monthly climatology
(Waha et al., 2012). This procedure follows the commonly used
approach of identifying the onset and end of the rainy season with
a criterion based on the average rainfall or radiation of a speciﬁc
period, e.g. 5 days (Marengo et al., 2001; Omotosho et al., 2000;
Wang and Ho, 2002). This criterion is deﬁned here as the 3-month
averaged ratio between precipitation and potential evapotranspi-
ration which is based on the methodology for the global scale
described in Waha et al. (2012) but additionally allows for
calculating the end of the growing season.

where P/PET is the mean 3-month averaged precipitation-to-
potential evapotranspiration ratio, P/PETm is the precipitation-to-
potential evapotranspiration ratio of each individual month m.
Potential evapotranspiration is calculated in LPJmL using the
Priestley–Taylor equations (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) with a
Priestley–Taylor coefﬁcient of 1.391 (Gerten et al., 2004).

Consequently, the onset of the growing season is deﬁned as the
ﬁrst month in a 3-month period where precipitation-to-potential-
evapotranspiration ratios exceed the mean ratio. Within this
month the growing period of an individual crop starts at the ﬁrst
wet day with daily precipitation above 0.1 mm; in sequential
cropping systems the following crop is assumed to be sown
immediately after the harvest of the ﬁrst crop. In temperate
environments such as parts of South Africa the start of the growing
season is determined by daily temperature as described in Waha
et al. (2012). The start of the main rainy season in sub-Saharan
Africa as simulated here agrees well with the observed start of the
main growing season derived from satellite data (Supporting
Material B). A second growing season which occurs in areas with a
bimodal rainfall distribution is not simulated.

The growing period is limited to a maximum of 330 days
allowing for a short fallow period between two consecutive years.
The simulated harvested carbon in gC/m2 is converted to crop yield
in Mcal/ha to allow for a comparison between crops and cropping
systems with:

Y Mcal ¼ H
0:45

 100
DM

 Cal  105

where Y Mcal is the caloriﬁc yield in Mcal/ha, H the harvested carbon
in gC/m2, DM the crop-speciﬁc dry matter content in %, and Cal the
crop-speciﬁc calorie content in Mcal/g fresh matter (Table 2). 0.45
converts from gC/m2 to gDM (Rojstaczer et al., 2001). Dry matter

content and calorie content of crop products are taken from
Wirsenius (2000) and from FAO Food Balance Sheets (FAO, 2001).
The overall crop yield in sequential cropping systems is the sum of
two individual crop yields in Mcal/ha.

Management intensity in a cropping system is described by
three parameters: the maximal attainable leaf area index, the
maximal harvest index and a parameter scaling leaf-level biomass
to ﬁeld level as described in Fader et al. (2010). The management
intensities per crop and country were chosen to match observed
production levels of FAO in the 5-year-period 1999–2003
(Supporting Material C).

2.5. Modelling the spatial variation of PHUsin and PHUseq

PHUsin and PHUseq are calculated by accumulating daily
temperatures above a base temperature threshold (Table 2)
summed over the growing period that is reported in the household
survey. In order to estimate PHUsin for each crop in each grid cell in
sub-Saharan Africa, we use a multiple linear regression model

between PHUsin and climatic parameters in each grid cell. We
found a correlation, although light for maize and groundnut,
between PHUsin, mean annual temperature and moisture condi-
tions during the growing season:

PHUsin ¼ a þ bT þ gPgs þ dPETgs

where T is the annual mean temperature, Pgs the sum of monthly
precipitation during the growing season, PETgs the sum of monthly
potential evapotranspiration during the growing season, and a, b, g
and d are empirical parameters.

Precipitation and potential evapotranspiration represent the
atmospheric water supply and water demand, respectively. Thus
their ratio in the growing season represents the water availability
during the period of high agricultural activity. The start and end of
the growing season is calculated using the criterion described in
the previous section.

We compare PHUsin and PHUseq with the aim of verifying the
assumption that farmers apply short-growing crop cultivars in

sequential cropping systems and long-growing crop cultivars in
single cropping systems. We test if PHUsin is statistically greater
than PHUseq for each crop using the non-parametric Wilcoxon
signed-rank test (Wilcoxon, 1945). In order to estimate PHUseq for
each crop in each grid cell, we derive a uniform crop-speciﬁc factor
PHUgap from the calculated PHUsin and PHUseq to account for the
deviation between them:

sequential cropping systems are based on maize, whereas in
Southern Africa wheat-maize systems are additionally applied.
Systems based on groundnut as the ﬁrst crop can be found in
Ghana and in Cameroon, which is the country with the highest
diversity in sequential cropping systems. The highest-yielding
among all 13 traditional sequential cropping systems are mostly
based on maize (Table 3).

2.6. Theoretical potential of sequential cropping systems

In addition to the analysis of climate change impacts on crop
yields in districts where sequential cropping systems are already
grown, we apply a similar analysis to the entire region of sub-
Saharan Africa that currently has growing periods larger than 5
months (HarvestChoice, 2010) to analyse the adaptation potential
of sequential cropping systems. Crop yields from 13 sequential
cropping systems and six single cropping systems are simulated
with LPJmL and compared in all sub-Saharan Africa grid cells that
are currently used for crop production following Fader et al. (2010).

3. Results

3.1. Sequential cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa

In 35% of the surveyed districts one or more sequential cropping
system exist, but only in seven out of 10 surveyed countries and
about 17% of the districts sequential cropping systems are
composed of crops included in our model. The remaining
sequential cropping systems consist of at least one crop other
than the LPJmL crops, most of them are vegetables, fruits, beans,
peas or perennial crops. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the 13
traditional sequential cropping systems in the surveyed districts.
The sequential cropping systems frequently applied are mostly
based on groundnut and maize and to a smaller extent also on
cassava, rice, wheat, and cowpea, but only few sequential cropping
systems exist with sunﬂower or soybean, which are of minor
importance in the surveyed households. In Eastern Africa all

3.2. Growing periods and PHUs of different crop cultivars

The lengths of the growing periods calculated from the
household survey of most of the crops lie within the range of
values found in the literature, except for cowpea, groundnut and
maize (Table 4). The growing periods from the household survey
and the corresponding PHUs differ signiﬁcantly between single
and sequential cropping systems as well as between crops (see
level of signiﬁcance and PHUgap in Table 2). The results of the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicate that PHUsin signiﬁcantly
exceeds PHUseq by 900 8Cd on average. The deviation between
large PHUsin and small PHUseq per individual crop is signiﬁcant as
well and can be described by the crop-speciﬁc factor PHUgap, which
accordingly is less than 1 (Table 2).

Using the multiple regression model to determine the heat sum
requirements for phenological development, simulated growing
periods from LPJmL differ from growing periods in the household
survey: for wheat, rice and cowpea simulated growing periods are
on average 5–32 days shorter than the growing periods in the
household survey while those for groundnut, cassava and maize
are on average 7–33 days longer than the growing periods reported
in the household survey (Fig. 4).

3.3. Changes in crop yields

3.3.1. Decreasing crop yields

Future crop yields averaged over all locations contained in the
household survey (Fig. 3) decrease between 6% and 24% because of
climate change depending on the GCM and management scenario
(Table 5). The decrease is always weakest in the management
scenarios with traditional sequential cropping systems. There are

differences in mean crop yields and crop yield changes between
the three GCMs, with the highest crop yields under CCSM3 and the
lowest under ECHAM5. Southern and Western Africa are the most
heavily impacted regions with declines in crop yield of up to 45%
and 18% respectively depending on the management scenario
(Fig. 5). However, impacts in Southern Africa are diverse and crop
yields in some locations also increase by up to 6% in the TS scenario.
Some traditional sequential cropping systems based on rice in
Burkina Faso and based on groundnut in Ghana and Cameroon are
most heavily impacted with crop yield declines by at least 25%
(Supporting Material D). In contrast, some traditional sequential
cropping systems based on maize and wheat in Kenya and South

Africa gain by at least 25%. Mean future crop yields are higher (+11
to 17%) in the TS, SC and HS scenarios with adapted sowing dates
compared to the corresponding TSco, SCco and HSco scenarios with
constant sowing dates (Table 5). As an exception, adapting sowing
dates is not beneﬁcial for crop productivity under climate change
in some single and sequential cropping systems. These are the rice
single cropping system at Bama/Burkina Faso, maize double
cropping system in Nyong-et-Kelle/Cameroon, groundnut-maize
systems in Manyu/Cameroon and several cropping systems in
Aberdeen/South Africa where crop yields in scenarios with adapted
sowing dates is lower than in scenarios with constant sowing dates
under current and future climate (Supporting Material D).

sub-Saharan Africa are excluded because the crop area is smaller than 0.001% of the grid cell area or the growing season length is less than 5 months. The high standard
deviation in Southern Africa is mainly determined by the large difference in climate projections.

3.3.2. Sequential cropping systems vs. single cropping systems

Crop caloriﬁc yields in management scenarios with single
cropping systems (SC/SCco) only reach 38–54% of crop caloriﬁc
yields obtained in management scenarios with sequential cropping
systems (TS/TSco and HS/HSco) under current climatic conditions
averaged over all locations contained in the household survey
(Table 5). As an exception, the single cropping systems (SC/SCco)
with maize in Kenya and South Africa yield higher in some
locations than the traditional sequential cropping system, but only
under current climatic conditions (Supporting Material D).

Crop yields in the highest-yielding sequential cropping systems
(HS) exceed crop yields in the traditional sequential cropping
systems (TS) by 24–28% depending on the GCM (Table 5). However,
frequently the traditional sequential cropping systems are more
resilient against negative climate change impacts than the highest-
yielding sequential cropping systems like e.g. groundnut–cassava

systems in Cameroon, maize–maize systems in some locations in
Kenya, wheat-maize systems in some locations in South Africa and
maize–wheat systems in Zimbabwe (Supporting Material D).

3.3.3. Potential of sequential cropping systems in sub-Saharan Africa
If only the most stable sequential cropping systems would be
chosen everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa, crop yields would be
also less impacted by climate change than crop yields in single
cropping systems in many locations (Fig. 6). Crop yields in both
systems mostly decline, most severely in western Mali, southern
Mauritania and Senegal, but increase in small parts of South Africa,
Kenya and Ethiopia. However, in the last-mentioned locations
there is also the highest variability of climate change impacts
on crop yields. The single cropping systems least impacted by
climate change are cassava and maize, and to a smaller extent
also rice. The sequential cropping systems least impacted are

4. Discussion

4.1. Changes in crop yield

Crop yield decreases, mostly for single cropping systems, were
reported by other studies as well (Jones and Thornton, 2003; Lobell
et al., 2008; Schlenker and Lobell, 2010; Thornton et al., 2011).
Lobell et al. (2008) show declines in crop yield by up to 30% for
maize in Southern Africa, millet in Central Africa and cowpea in
Eastern Africa as early as 2030. In contrast to our results, Thornton
et al. (2011) report higher mean production decreases for maize in
2090 in Western Africa than in Southern Africa, but in line with our
results they project higher declines than in Eastern Africa.
However, a comparison between these results and our study is
difﬁcult due
time horizons, methodological
approaches, climate projections and crop parameterization.

temperatures in all

Mean crop yield decreases on average are most severe in
Western and Southern Africa due to climate change (Table 6).
Increasing annual
regions lead to an
accelerated phenological development and thus reduce growing
periods by 31–65 days. Furthermore, growing season precipitation
decreases in Southern Africa indicating a higher risk of water
stress, in contrast to Eastern Africa with considerable increases in
growing season precipitation. Water stress during the growing
period affects photosynthesis as well as leaf and root growth,
depending on the phenological stage (Supporting Material D).
Therefore, total biomass as well as the biomass of harvested crop

organs is reduced, depending on the crop type and cropping
system. In contrast, in the temperate zone of South-East Africa
precipitation is projected to increase or to remain constant from all
three GCMs, leading to increased crop yields in some traditional
sequential cropping systems (Fig. 5) and also in some single
cropping systems (Supporting Material D).

4.2. Beneﬁt of adapting the sowing date and the cropping system

Farmers can lower the negative impact of changing climate on
crop yields by adapting the sowing date to the start of the main
rainy season, which is already done in many locations today. While
in the Northern provinces of South Africa only 3% (Gbetibouo,
2009) and in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia only 5% (Deressa et al., 2009)
of surveyed farmers shift their planting dates to match delayed or
early rainfall, Hassan and Nhemachena (2008) found that 16% of
more than 8000 households in 11 African countries change
planting dates as response to perceived changes in temperature
and precipitation.

Simulation studies for Cameroon indicated that crop yields of
maize and groundnut with an optimal planting date are usually
higher compared to crop yields obtained using traditional planting
dates if climate changes (Laux et al., 2010; Tingem and Rivington,
2009). This is in agreement with our ﬁndings, as the adaptation of
sowing dates in our study usually results in higher crop
productivity in most regions and cropping systems (Table 7).
The beneﬁts from adapting sowing dates at two locations in
Cameroon are even higher in these studies, as they optimize the
sowing date in order to maximize crop yields whereas in our study
the sowing date is adapted to a shifted start of the rainy season.

140

K. Waha et al. / Global Environmental Change 23 (2013) 130–143

There are, however some exceptions with lower crop yields in
scenarios with adapted/optimized sowing dates in both studies as
well as in our study. One reason for this is that at some locations,
temperature and not precipitation is the limiting factor for
agricultural production like in the case of a mountainous location
in Cameroon (Laux et al., 2010) and South Africa (this study). At
other locations, the method of calculating the start of the main
rainy season might not be detailed enough to adapt sowing dates to
changing precipitation patterns.

With few exceptions, mean crop yields in sequential cropping
systems exceed mean crop yields in single cropping systems
because the second harvest will often also be successful under
changing climatic conditions. The most productive sequential
cropping systems are not always the most stable systems against
negative climate change impacts. Instead the traditional sequential
cropping systems which are already applied today will provide
lower but more stable crop yields in many locations and poor
farmers which rely on stable crop production will prefer them to
highest-yielding cropping systems.

4.3. Limitations of the modelling approach

LPJmL is a vegetation model for managed land designed and
parameterized for global or regional studies driven by aggregate
soil and climate information. Detailed local soil and climatic
conditions, speciﬁc agronomic practices, the occurrence of pests
and diseases, various socio-economic aspects – despite their
importance for local crop yields and farmers management
decisions – therefore cannot be considered. Crop growth in
advanced development stages is not terminated in the model by
severe heat stress or desiccation. Crop yields are expected to
decline by more than 10% per 8C temperature increase considering
the effect of heat damage on maize grown in areas with growing
season temperatures of more than 25 8C (Lobell et al., 2011).
However, temperature and water stress negatively affect photo-
synthesis, leaf and root growth and the production of storage
organs during the growing period in the model and crop growth is
terminated under poor growing conditions at the beginning of the
phenological development. Therefore resowing within the same
month is possible. The crop’s inﬂuence on soil properties is not
considered in the model but can noticeably beneﬁt the yield of the
subsequent crop by e.g. leaving nitrogen in the soil if cowpea is
grown (Madamba et al., 2006) or by improving the P-uptake of
subsequent maize through mycorrhizal associations (Adjei-Nsiah
et al., 2007) if cassava is grown. Furthermore crop rotations can
reduce disease pressure from soil-or root-borne pathogens and
pests and weed densities (Bennett et al., 2012), which is not
considered in our study.

As the cultivated area of each cropping system within the study
area is still unknown, it remains unclear how the total crop
production will be affected by climate change in each country if
sequential cropping systems are considered. Furthermore, devel-
opments in the demand for certain agricultural products, popula-
tion size and availability of land and water resources must be
considered when deciding on the most suitable management
strategy for a location. The positive effects of elevated atmospheric
CO2 concentrations and technology development on crop yields
are not considered in this study. Crop yields are expected to
increase by 10–20% for C3 crops (e.g. wheat, rice) and 0–10% for C4
crops (e.g. maize, millet) if atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise
from 380 ppm to 550–600 ppm (Tubiello, 2007), but only if other
biotic (like pests) or abiotic (like nutrients) factors do not become
limiting (Long et al., 2006). It is therefore unlikely that CO2
fertilization will have a strong effect on crop yields at current
management intensities in sub-Saharan Africa. If effective to some
extend, the CO2 fertilization effect will potentially reduce the

superiority of maize-based systems, with maize being a less
affected C4 crop.

4.4. Uncertainties from the household survey

Although the questionnaire used in the household survey only
asked for crops cultivated within one farming season, the length of
the growing periods calculated for single and sequential cropping
systems indicates that farmers also reported agricultural activities
beyond that period. Despite excluding some obvious cases from
the study it remains unclear if the reported farming activities refer
to only one farming season in all cases. Moreover, crop failure was
not reported in the survey, leading to uncertainty about the
validity of the reported sowing and harvest dates in cases where
farmers were forced to resow the chosen crop but did not report
the new sowing date. In addition some crops, such as cassava,
maize or legumes might have an extended harvest period because
of uneven ripening, better in-ground than out-of-ground stor-
ability or because multiple harvest products can be obtained from
one crop (green and dry maize) (Fermont and Benson, 2011) This
might lead to longer growing periods reported in the household
survey than found in literature (Table 4). The geographic position
of the households interviewed for the survey is not known, only the
position of the districts they are located in. These were later used
for the conversion from districts to grid cells. Therefore a
considerable range of different cropping systems and growing
periods can be found in a single grid cell,
leading to some
uncertainty in the multiple regression model between PHUsin and
the climate parameters which were used to describe the crop’s
development. However, the simulated lengths of growing periods
differ only slightly between 5 and 33 days on average from those
reported in the household survey, but with 50% of all values having
a deviation of up to 58 and 65 days for cassava and groundnut
respectively (Fig. 4).

4.5. Farmers’ adaptation options

Although sequential cropping systems are advantageous in
terms of maximizing crop yields and minimizing climate change
impacts compared to single cropping systems in many locations,
farmers in 65% of the surveyed administrative units do not apply
them. The growing season length in e.g. Senegal, Niger and parts of
Ethiopia is not suitable to grow more than one crop. In districts
climatically suitable for sequential cropping systems, growing a
second crop requires sufﬁcient labour and is risky if the rainy
season ends too early and the crop fails. The ﬁrst crop needs to be
harvested, processed and stored or sold on the market during the
period of land preparation and sowing of the second crop, which
leads to a high demand for labour and possibly for draught animals
(Gill, 1991). Moreover, introducing an unknown cropping system
may also require some adjustments to current technology and
management, which is often made more difﬁcult by a lack of inputs
like seeds or fertilizer, missing knowledge about cultivation and
processing of the new cropping system and lacking market access
to sell the products (Lotze-Campen and Schellnhuber, 2009). It
therefore remains unclear if farmers will be able to apply the most
beneﬁcial cropping system.

Farmers will not only decide on the crop and cropping system
with respect to productivity but also pay attention to other crop
characteristics, such as its performance on local soils, the colour,
shape and taste of harvestable organs, bacterial tolerance, market
acceptability and storability (Haugerud and Collinson, 1990;
Sperling et al., 1993). In West Africa, farmers prefer e.g. an
early-maturing millet cultivar at the beginning of the growing
season because their food supply is very low after a long dry season
and they need to harvest fast (Kowal and Kassam, 1978). In

K. Waha et al. / Global Environmental Change 23 (2013) 130–143

141

addition to adapting the cropping system and the crops’ growing
period to the best growing conditions, the farmers’ options for
adapting to changing climate include managing water resources by
using e.g. water harvesting techniques (Kahinda et al., 2007; Rost
et al., 2009), managing biodiversity, integrating animals into farming
systems (Mortimore and Adams, 2001), diversifying livelihoods
(Cooper et al., 2008) and diversifying the whole agricultural system
(Lin, 2011). We consider none of these options in our analysis here. In
Tanzania, 33 different practices which are potentially suitable for
adaptation to climate change, ranging from agricultural water
management practices and adjustments of farm and crop manage-
ment to diversiﬁcation beyond the farm, are already used by farmers
today (Below et al., 2011). Indigenous soil conservation techniques
and agro-forestry practices are additional examples for adaptation
options not covered in this study. They are well known and already
applied in local communities, as they conserve soil moisture and soil
carbon (Nyong et al., 2007) and protect crops from dry spells,
extreme temperatures and storm events (Lin, 2011).

5. Summary and conclusions

Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa grow a wide range of crops and
apply different cropping systems, but as shown in our study clearly
prefer long-growing crop cultivars in single cropping systems and
short-growing crop cultivars in sequential cropping systems. For the
ﬁrst time, this study also shows the spatial distribution of sequential
cropping systems applied in seven sub-Saharan Africa countries and
enables us to analyse climate change effects on crop yields
considering the cropping system type. They need to be included
in climate change impact studies because simulated crop yields
differ considerably between crops and cropping systems and also
depend on the timing of sowing. Our newly developed modelling
approach therefore helps to identify the best management strategy
for adaptation to climate change. In single cropping systems crops
grow longer but are only harvested once a year, leading to lower crop
yields than in sequential cropping systems with shorter growing
periods but higher cropping intensities. However, only farmers in
regions with adequate temperature, precipitation and solar radia-
tion can beneﬁt from higher cropping intensities in sequential
cropping systems. It is important to note that farmers are able to
reduce the negative effects of climate change and minimize the risk
of crop failure by applying low-tech adaptation options on a farm
level. Despite the advantage of sequential cropping systems over
single cropping systems in many locations, since both higher crop
yields and lower declines in crop yield in future are possible, farmers
might not always be able to apply them if inputs and labour for
agricultural production are lacking. This implies that farmers would
beneﬁt from improved knowledge and further ﬁeld studies about
crops and cropping systems, also ones currently uncommon in their
country, and from reliable weather and seasonal climate forecasts.
Furthermore stable economic and political conditions would
support private trading and the further development of market
opportunities. Such conditions would strengthen the farmers’
adaptive capacity, perhaps also allowing them to take advantage
of sequential cropping systems while at the same time facing the
challenge of changing climate conditions.

Authors’ contribution

The contribution of the different authors was as follows: K.W.
and C.M. conceived the original idea of studying the susceptibility
of multiple cropping systems to climate change, K.W., C.M., A.B.,
J.P.D. and H.L.-C. were involved in developing the methodology.
K.W., C.M., A.B. and J.H. implemented the concepts in the model,
