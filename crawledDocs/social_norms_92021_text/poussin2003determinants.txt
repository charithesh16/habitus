Abstract

Determinants of irrigated rice yield were studied in 45 rice fields in the Senegal River valley during 2 years in both wet
and dry growing seasons. Grain yields were highly variable, ranging from 0 to 9.5 t ha1, with an average yield over
years and seasons of 5 t ha1, indicating an average yield gap of about 4/5 t ha1 between actual farmers’ yields and
potential yields. Soil P and K status of farmers’ fields were mostly above critical limits and pH and electrical
conductivity values were in the optimal range for irrigated rice. Average yield levels for three out of the four seasons
were not significantly different. However, cold temperatures at the onset of the dry season induced slower development
rate and lower above-ground biomass despite higher plant and tiller density at panicle initiation (PI). Analysis of
growth cycle and spikelet sterility levels in the sample fields using the RIDEV simulation model showed that yield losses
due to cold or heat stress around flowering could be neglected. Yield variability was, therefore, assumed to be mostly
due to differences in crop management (other than choice of sowing and harvest dates) at the farmer level. Plant density
in the dry season was significantly higher than in the wet season in both transplanted and direct-seeded fields, with
farmers compensating for retarded growth at the onset of the dry season due to cold temperatures. Low transplanting
density and the use of relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and tiller densities determined at PI. Principal
component analyses conducted with three variables, i.e. plant density, tiller density and rice*/above-ground dry weight
determined at PI and yield components at maturity allowed to determine the effect of crop management. Sub-optimal
weed and N fertilizer management were major factors driving yield variability in farmers’ fields. Increasing the
productivity of irrigated rice will require collective action at both field and scheme level.

1. Introduction

Senegal is one of the countries in West Africa
that rely to a large extent on imports to face a
growing demand for rice (/600 000 t year1).
Domestic production covers only about 20% of
this demand, of which most is produced in the

Senegal River valley, from a surface area that
ranges from 25 000 to 35 000 ha year1. Until the
late 1980s, the local
irrigation authority SAED
(Socie´te´ Nationale d’Ame´nagement et d’Exploita-
tion des terres du Delta et des valle´es du fleuve
Se´ne´gal et de la Fale´me´) was responsible for the
development of
irrigation in Senegal. SAED
managed irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
land preparation, purchase of inputs, and bought
paddy at subsidized prices (Le Gal and Dia, 1991).
In 1987, SAED withdrew from the rice production
process. Since 1994, all rice irrigation schemes
have been privatized and most irrigation schemes
are now managed by farmer organizations.

Double cropping (growing rice in the wet and
dry seasons on the same field) is possible, but
hardly practised in the Senegal River valley (Le
Gal and Papy, 1998). The potential grain yield that
can be obtained ranges from 8 to 9 t ha1 in the
wet season (July sowing) and from 6 to 11 t ha1
in the dry season (February sowing). Potential
yields generally decline moving inland because of
heat stress at
flowering (Dingkuhn and Sow,
1997). Farmers’ yields are on average between 4
and 5 t ha1, and, therefore, far below potential
yields. Crop management practices among farmers
are highly variable (Poussin, 1995, 1998), espe-
cially as far as weed and fertilizer management is
concerned (Diallo and Johnson, 1997; Wopereis et
al., 1999; Haefele et al., 2000).

Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley
often need rehabilitation because of land leveling
problems and poor condition of irrigation canals.
Land preparation is mostly done under dry soil
conditions, usually with a disk plow. The resulting
seedbed is often uneven with large soil clods
(Kante´, 1996).

Farmers rarely buy certified seeds. Almost 50%
of rice area is sown with seed retained from the
previous harvest (Poussin, 1997; Be´lie`res et al.,
1997). In the Senegal River delta, the majority of
the farmers direct seed rice rather than transplant
the crop. Moving inland, transplanting becomes
more and more important.

Weed infestation is one of the most important
factors reducing rice yields in Senegal (SAED,
1997; Haefele et al., 2000). Yield losses of between
30 and 90% were observed in direct-seeded rice
and up to 40% in transplanted rice (Diallo and
Johnson, 1997). Haefele et al. (2000) demonstrated
that benefits from improved weed control were in
the order of 1 t ha1 or almost 25% above
farmers’ practice. The most common herbicides
are propanil and 2,4-D amine, mostly mixed before
spraying. The dosage applied (average of 4.6 and
1.5 l ha1, respectively; Be´lie`res et al., 1997) are
close to recommended doses (6 and 1 l ha1,
respectively). Farmers often delay herbicide appli-
cation until weeds are impeding rice growth
(Haefele et al., 2000), resulting in poor weed
control.

SAED recommends farmers to apply fertilizer in
three splits. The first is a basal application of 100
kg ha1 of diammonium-phosphate (DAP, con-
taining 18% N and 20% P). The second consists of
100 kg urea (46% N) at the start of tillering for
direct seeding, or after the transplanting shock in
case of transplanting. The third application con-
sists of 100 kg urea ha1 at panicle initiation (PI),
i.e. at about 1 month after the second split. In
practice, farmers rarely apply fertilizers in three
applications. Because of late arrival of fertilizers
and because farmers want to avoid that weeds
profit from basal fertilizer, DAP is often mixed
with urea and applied at the start of tillering
(Wopereis et al., 1999). Fertilizer use is generally
profitable in Sahelian West Africa (Donovan et
al., 1999). Soil salinity is very pronounced in the
delta of the Senegal River, but salinity levels
decrease moving inland (Wopereis et al., 1998).

The objective of this paper is to shed more light
on the importance of soil and weather variability
and crop management on yield formation in
farmers’ fields under irrigation in the Senegal
River valley.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Site description and surveys

The surveys were conducted in the region of
Podor (16840?N, 158W), situated in the Senegal
River middle valley, about 200 km east of the
mouth of the Senegal River (see map in Fig. 1).
Irrigation schemes in the Senegal River valley have
been mostly installed on heavy clay (i.e. arid
Vertisol, Soil Survey Staff, 1981), locally known
as Hollalde´ or Faux-Hollalde´. The first rice crop is
sown during the hot dry season (mostly in
February) and the second crop during the wet
season (mostly in July). Late sowing in the wet
season results in a risk of spikelet sterility due to
cold in November (Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Air
temperatures in February to March are relatively
low, slowing down crop development in the dry
season. From May to June, hot and dry winds
around flowering may cause spikelet
sterility
(Dingkuhn et al., 1995a,b). Rice fields are flooded

for 100/120 days during each growth cycle.
Irrigation water from the Senegal River is supplied
to the field by floating pumps. The potential yield
level that can be obtained in Podor with July
sowing in the wet season and February sowing in
the dry season is about 8/9 t ha1 (Dingkuhn and
Sow, 1997).

Our sample included 45 rice fields cultivated by
11 farmers in 11 irrigation schemes in the Podor
region. The survey included 9 fields in the 1994 dry
season, 17 fields in the 1994 wet season, 6 fields in
the 1995 dry season and 13 fields in the 1995 wet
season. Farmers used four indica cultivars: Aiwu
(short duration, slender grain), I Kong Pao (short
duration, bold grain) and IR1529 and Jaya
(medium duration, slender grain). Out of the 45
fields, 27 were transplanted and 18 direct-seeded.
Each farmer cultivated various fields in the area in
different irrigation schemes and used sometimes
more than one crop establishment method. One to
four (the exact number depending on field size) 16
m2 micro-plots were installed in each farmer field,
yielding 18 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season, 38
in the 1994 wet season, 14 in the 1995 dry season
and 28 in the 1995 wet season. On this total of 98
micro-plots, 4 micro-plots in the 1994 dry season,
6 in the 1995 dry season and 1 in the 1995 wet
season had no panicles at all at maturity, leaving a
total of 87 plots with harvested yield.

2.2. Soil analyses

The topsoil (0/0.2 m depth) from all fields was
sampled before the onset of the growing season
(one composite sample from 5 samples taken at
random per field). Soil analyses (P-Olsen, pH,
electrical conductivity, CEC and exchangeable K)
were conducted in the IRD laboratory in Dakar,
Senegal following standard methodologies.

2.3. Fertilizer and weed management practices

Weed management (mode, dosage, timing and
type of herbicide used if any) was monitored for
each field. Visual scores of weed infestation were
taken at PI and maturity. Three classes of surface
area coverage by weeds were distinguished: less
than 10%; between 10 and 30%; and more than

344

30%. These visual estimates were calibrated by
estimating oven-dry weight (2 days, 70 8C) of
above-ground weed biomass in 25 micro-plots,
taking four 0.32 m2 samples per micro-plot, using
0.64 m diameter rings.

Fertilizer management (timing and dosage of
fertilizer application) was also monitored. Data
obtained for each fertilizer application and farmer
were grouped into five classes:

i)

timely application, sufficient dosage (/50
kg N ha1);

spikelet sterility due to cold stress (mainly in the
wet season, but cold may also affect early sowing
in the dry season) and heat stress (exclusively
during the dry season). Simulations were con-
ducted year-round, using 14 years of weather data
from the Podor region for direct-seeded I Kong
Pao, a short-duration rice cultivar widely grown in
the region in 1994 and 1995. Spikelet sterility
percentages were also determined for actual farmer
sowing dates and varietal choice using 1994 and
1995 weather data from Podor to investigate if in
some cases heat or cold stress affected farmer
yields.

2.4. Crop establishment, development and yield
components

Four 0.32 m2 samples were taken at PI and
maturity using 0.64 m diameter rings placed at
random in each micro-plot. At PI, the canopy
structure was determinated from the number of
plants, number of tillers, and oven-dry weight (2
days at 70 8C) of above-ground rice biomass per
unit area. At maturity, rice grain yield (corrected
for 14% moisture) and yield components were
determined. Yield components included panicle
number, spikelet number, straw weight (oven-dry
weight of rice green and dead biomass) per unit
area, and filled spikelet percentage, and the
average weight of one single rice grain (in mg,
corrected for 14% moisture) determined from 1000
grains.

2.5. Crop modeling

The RIDEV model (Dingkuhn et al., 1995b;
Dingkuhn, 1997) was used to determine best
periods for rice cropping in both growing seasons.
The model uses daily minimum and maximum air
temperatures, sowing date, variety-specific photo-
thermal constants and crop establishment method
as
inputs. Outputs are growth duration and

Data analysis first allowed to estimate the effect
of year, season and cultivar on yield formation.
We subsequently removed these effects through
data transformation to analyze the effect of crop
management (weeding and N fertilization), regard-
less of season, year or cultivar.

For each plant variable measured at maturity,
i.e. year (with two
the effects of three factors,
terms: 1994 and 1995), cultivar (with four terms:
Aiwu, I Kong Pao, IR1529, Jaya) and season (with
two terms: dry season and wet season) were
estimated and subsequently removed through
within-group reduction. For each plant variable
and micro-plot i , the average of a given term over
all micro-plots was subtracted from the actual
value for this term in micro-plot i , yielding the
transformed value. For example, for all micro-
plots i with cultivar c , the transformed value Xi
equaled the margin between the original value Xi
and the average of X for all micro-plots i with
cultivar c . At PI, only the effect of season was
removed through normalization (cropping season
had an effect on the averages and standard
deviations). For each plant variable and micro-
plot i , the average of a given term over all micro-
plots was subtracted from the actual value for the
term in micro-plot i , and the result was divided by
the standard deviation of the term. For example,
for all micro-plots i cropped in the dry season, the
transformed value Xi equaled the margin between
the original value Xi and the average of X for all
micro-plots i cropped in dry season, divided by the

can be made under the hypothesis that no inter-

Two principal component analyses were con-
ducted using the transformed data. The first
principal component analysis (PCA1) was con-
ducted for the variables plant density, tiller density
and above-ground biomass measured at PI. The
factorial axis of PCA1 reflected the canopy
architecture measured in the fields at PI. The
second analysis (PCA2) included panicle density,
straw weight,
filled spikelets
percentage and single grain weight measured at
maturity. Yield was introduced as a supplemen-
tary variable in the PCA2 to evaluate the weight of
each factorial axis in explaining its variability. The
factorial axis of PCA2 reflected the yield structure
at maturity. We used software package ADE-4
(Thioulouse et al., 1996).

The effects of crop installation (direct seeding or
transplanting) and management (weeding and N
fertilizer) were measured on the factor loadings of
PCA1 and PCA2 through ANOVA.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Effects of soil variability

Soil analyses showed that P Olsen ranged from
5.9 to 32 mg kg1, with an average of 15.1

mg kg1. Dobermann et al. (1995) reported cri-
tical levels for Olsen plant available P from 4 to 29
mg kg1. The range of critical levels reported in
literature for K availability in rice soils is between
0.1 and 0.4 cmol kg soil1 (Dobermann et al.,
1995). In our fields, exchangeable K values varied
from 0.2 to 1.2 cmol kg1. CEC ranged from 10 to
32 cmol kg1 and were strongly correlated with
clay content (r2/0.857). CEC may affect avail-
ability of micro-nutrients, but no signs of defi-
ciency were observed in any field. Soil texture has
an influence on soil-water status, but all fields were
well-watered and drought stress did not occur in
harvested plots. The pH of the topsoil varied
between 5.1 and 7.5. Electrical conductivity (EC)
values ranged from 0.02 to 0.23 mS cm1. These
values do not constitute a constraint to irrigated
rice cropping (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We
assumed, therefore, that initial soil P and K status
and soil salinity levels were not hampering rice
growth.

3.2. Effects of weather variability

Rice grain yields ranged from 0 to 9.5 Mg ha1
(Table 1), with an average yield of 5 t ha1 over
both years and seasons. Yields may have been
over-estimated somewhat due to the relatively
small size of the micro-plots. The average yield
gap between potential yields and farmers’ yields
was, therefore, about 4/5 Mg ha1. Three fields
were not harvested in the 1995 dry season and one
field in the 1994 dry season due to extensive bird

a specific year), it would be best to sow I Kong
Pao in Podor between 7 December and 3 Septem-
ber. If this percentage may not exceed 30% in any
year (the maximum spikelet sterility must still be
lower than 30%), the most favorable periods are
from 22 December to 1 January, from 31 January
to 22 February and from 22 March to 24 August.
January sowing may lead to flowering in April,
when temperatures are still relatively low, in some
years leading to spikelet sterility due to cold.
February and March sowing may lead to flowering
in May to early June, when temperatures are very
high, which may lead to spikelet sterility due to
heat. For transplanting, these best sowing periods
need to be moved forward by 10/15 days.

At the scheme level, the first two sowing periods
(from 22 December to 1 January and from 31
January to 22 February) are too short to sow all
the fields. Therefore, the favorable sowing period
is from the end of March to the end of August, i.e.
about 5 months. The average growth duration in
the dry season is about 4 months (Fig. 3), leaving
only 1 month to prepare the field for the next crop
on the same field. Double cropping requires good
collective organization at the scheme scale (Le Gal
and Papy, 1998). Farmers will often prefer to grow
two crops on different fields or schemes.

RIDEV simulations using actual sowing dates
of sample farmers showed that sowing dates were
well chosen. Only 1 farmer may have experienced a
10% spikelet sterility problem in the 1995 wet
season. The relatively low filled spikelet percentage
values in Table 2 are, therefore, due to grain filling
problems, and not spikelet sterility.

Yield losses due to late harvesting could not be
analyzed in this study as all micro-plots were
harvested at physiological maturity. Farmers har-
vested their fields shortly after physiological ma-
turity in the dry seasons of 1994 and 1995. During
the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995 they harvested
their fields about 15 days after physiological
maturity.

The canopy architecture measured at PI signifi-
cantly differed (P B/0.0001) in the dry and wet
seasons for both crop establishment methods
(Table 3). Cold temperatures during crop estab-
lishment in the dry season induced lower levels of
above-ground biomass and slower development

damage and breakdown of pumps. Only 1994 dry
season yields were statistically different from the
other seasons (Table 1). Yield components are
shown per cultivar and season in Table 2. Panicle
density was significantly higher, and filled sterility
percentage and single grain weight significantly
lower in the dry season as compared to the wet

with higher level of tillering. Farmers compensated
for these harsher conditions by using a higher
density of sowing or transplanting in the dry
season as compared to the wet season.

All farmers used pre-germinated seed, however,
the large majority of farmers did not use certified
seeds. In direct-seeded fields, between 80 and 200
kg ha1 was
380/950
grains m2. Plant density measured at PI was
265 plants m2, i.e. less than half of the density of
seeds sown. Plant density was higher in the dry
season than in the wet season. Farmers increased
their sowing densities to compensate mortality
induced by cold during emergence. Plant density
was very variable, both within and between fields.
Poor seed quality and poor land preparation and
leveling explain the low ratio of plant density over
seed density. The variability between fields is
related to the use of different seeding rates, but
differences in weed infestation levels were also
important. The variability of densities was greater
in the dry season than in the wet season. Cold
temperatures at the onset of rice development
increased the effects of variability in emergence
conditions (seed quality, land preparation, weed
infestation).

Farmers transplanted relatively old seedlings.
Seedling age varied from 21 to 42 days (average 32
days) in the wet season and from 26 to 49 days
(average 38 days) in the dry season. The number of
hills per m2 was substantially greater in the dry
season (36) as compared to the wet season (19).
Like in direct-seeded fields, farmers compensated
for cold at
the dry season by
transplanting a higher number of seedlings per
hill, and a higher number of hills per m2. The
number of seedlings per hill was relatively high, i.e.
3.8 in the wet season and 4.6 in the dry season.

because they are taller and can support higher
in the field. However, older

al., 1990).

3.3.2. Weed management

Calibration of visual weed estimates showed
that a weed surface cover of
less than 10%
corresponded to between 0 and 24 g dry weed
biomass m2. A surface cover between 10 and
30% corresponded to a weed biomass between 13
and 228 g m2, and a cover of more than 30%
corresponded to a biomass greater than 130
g m2. Weed infestation was more pronounced
and intervened earlier in the growth cycle in direct-
seeded fields, and weed pressure was higher at the
end of the cycle than at PI. At PI, high levels of
weed infestation (weed cover /10% of the area)
was observed in 33 out the 50 direct-seeded plots
and only 11 out the 37 transplanted plots. At
low levels of weed infestation (weed
maturity,
cover B/10% of
the area) concerned only 7
direct-seeded plots vs. 17 transplanted plots.

In direct-seeded fields weed control was mainly
chemical. Only 1 field did not receive any herbi-
cide. The large majority of farmers used post-
emergence herbicides. These herbicides require
field drainage and should ideally be applied at
the 2/3 leaf stages of weeds. These conditions
were, however,
rarely followed, as was also
observed by Le Gal et al. (1990), Diagne (1995),
Diallo and Johnson (1997). The dosage applied
was smaller than recommended in 18 out of the 22
fields treated with herbicides. Some farmers hand
weeded at
tillering stage, however none hand
weeded prior to the second N application, which
explains the increase in weed biomass towards
maturity. In the transplanted fields, 14 out of the
17 fields were treated with pre- or post-emergence
herbicides at rates below recommended levels.
Only 2 farmers hand weeded before the second N
split, and weed biomass increased towards matur-
ity.

3.3.3. Nitrogen fertilizer management

The average total amount of N applied was 141
kg ha1 and 33 out of the 45 fields received more
than 100 kg ha1. The average total amount of P
applied was 23 kg ha1 and 34 fields received less
than 20 kg ha1.

variables panicle density (PAD), straw weight (SW), spikelet density (SD), filled spikelet percentage (FSP) and single grain weight

In the 27 direct-seeded fields, 10 fields received
only 1 split, 7 early in the growth cycle, and 3 late.
The first split was applied at the recommended
development stage (start of tillering) and at the
recommended dosage (/50 kg ha1) in 15 fields.
The second split was applied at the recommended
stage (PI) in 18 fields, but the dosage was below
the recommended level (B/50 kg ha1) in 6 fields.
Only 8 farmers followed all recommendations for
N application. The majority of
farmers that
followed recommendations for the first split, also
did so for the second N application.

The 18 transplanted fields received all two splits
of N, and all farmers applied N to their rice
seedling nurseries. The first split in the main field
was applied at the recommended development
stage (after

farmers

Generally, farmers followed recommendations
as far as N dosage and number of splits was
concerned, but they did not follow recommended
application dates. Similar observations were made
elsewhere in West Africa (Becker and Johnson,
1999; Wopereis et al., 1999) and Asia (Singh et al.,
1995; Cassman et al., 1997). Transplanted fields
were generally better followed than direct-seeded
fields. The second split was applied at the recom-
mended stage and at the recommended dosage in
the majority of cases. N fertilization of the seedling

nursery will have compensated for late application
of the first N split, or application of a relatively
low dosage. Weed infestation levels were lower in
transplanted fields at the beginning of the growth
cycle, and N application will, therefore, have been
more effective in these fields.

3.3.4. Principal component analyses

The first axis (S1) of the PCA1 explained 80% of
the variability observed (Table 4),
indicating a
strong correlation between plant density, tiller
density and above-ground biomass at PI. S1
measures plant stand and growth at PI. Table 5
shows the effect of weed infestation at PI com-
bined with N management (first application) on
the S1 factor loadings. In the direct-seeded plots,
management of the first N application had a
significant effect on the S1 factor loadings (P B/
0.01). Negative factor loadings were found if
recommendations on the first N application were
not followed, and positive factor loadings if the
recommendations were followed. For transplanted
plots, management of the first N application did
not have a significant effect on S1 factor loadings.
For both direct-seeded and transplanted micro-
plots, good weed management (weed cover B/
10%) combined with a first N application follow-
ing recommendations resulted in the highest aver-
age S1 factor loading. The S1 factor loadings for
the transplanted micro-plots were significantly
lower than those of direct-seeded micro-plots
(P B/0.001). Positive S1 factor loadings were only

ing essentially the variability in filled spikelet
percentage and single grain weight. Yield (trans-
formed data,
i.e. margins after removing the
effects of year, variety and season on the averages)
was very well represented on the first axis. Table 6
shows that in both direct-seeded and transplanted
micro-plots, management of the second N applica-
tion and the level of weed infestation had a
significant effect (P B/0.001) on factor loadings
of the first factorial axis of PCA2 (S2). S2 factor
loadings for direct-seeded micro-plots were on
average not significantly higher than for trans-
planted micro-plots (Table 6).

Differences in yield components (margins after
removing the effects of year, variety and season on
the averages) between direct-seeded and trans-
planted plots were quite substantial although
yields were similar (Table 7). Transplanted plots
had higher spikelet density than direct-seeded
plots, compensated with slightly lower single grain
weight; they had also lower panicle density com-
pensated with higher number of spikelets per
panicle than direct-seeded plots. This lower panicle

transplanted plots was entirely due to an increase
in spikelet density linked with an increase in
panicle density and/or number of spikelet per
panicle. Our results agree well with observations
by Haefele et al. (2000) who reported an increase
of 2 t ha1 through improved soil fertility and
weed management.

4. Conclusions

Soil and weather variability had a relatively
minor effect on rice yield variability in farmers’
fields. Simulation analysis showed that farmers
used sowing dates within the window recom-
mended for wet and dry seasons, avoiding spikelet
sterility due to cold or heat stress around flower-
ing. Harvest dates were also close to physiological
maturity of the rice crop. Yield variability was,
therefore, mostly due to differences
in crop
management (other than choice of sowing and
harvest dates) at the farmer level. However, cold
temperatures at
the dry season
reduced crop growth and increased within-field
tiller density variability.

the onset of

Direct seeding resulted in relatively high but
strongly variable plant density and more vigorous
growth in the vegetative phase than with trans-
planting. Low transplanting density and the use of
relatively old seedlings seriously affected plant and
tiller densities at PI, as illustrated by the low S1

density is illustrated by the lower S1 factor
loadings at PI. Low S1 factor loadings lead to
low S2 factor loadings apart
from the well-
managed plots (weed infestation at maturity B/
10% area and second N application following
recommendation) as shown in Fig. 5.

Well-managed plots in terms of fertilizer and
weed management resulted in substantially higher
grain yields (increase on average of 2.8 t ha1, see
Table 7). This yield increase in both direct and

354

factor loadings in PCA1. Management of the first
N split and weed infestation levels had a relatively
minor effect on plant stand at PI in transplanted
plots, but a very important effect in direct-seeded
plots. Management of the second N application
and weed infestation levels affected panicle density
and the number of spikelets per panicle in both
direct-seeded and transplanted plots, but had no
effect on single rice grain weight and filled spike-
lets percentage. Wopereis-Pura et al. (2002) re-
ported benefits from a third N splits in terms of
yield and grain quality. None of the farmers in this
study applied N in three splits.

Results indicate the importance of good crop
management in general in irrigated systems in the
Sahel. Yields that are realized in farmers’ fields are
still far from the potential that can be obtained
with the rice cultivars that are being used. Kebbeh
et al. (2002) demonstrated that information on
improved and integrated crop management (ICM)
is crucial to help farmers bridge this yield gap.
Increasing fertilizer and herbicide use efficiencies
will also reduce losses of N and herbicides to the
environment.

Improved and ICM would increase the effi-
ciency of inputs, such as N fertilizer and herbicide
and seed quantity used. WARDA and partners
have developed improved ICM options for irri-
gated rice cropping in the Sahel that are within
farmers’ means, based on farm surveys, and
farmer participatory on- and off-station research
(Wopereis et al., 2002). For the Senegal River
Valley, these options have been summarized in a
manual and posters (WARDA and SAED, 2001).
These posters are based on RIDEV simulations
and are specific to location, crop establishment
technique, sowing date and cultivar choice, and
can be adapted easily. The posters give a farming
calendar with management options for a given
site/sowing date/cultivar choice/crop estab-
lishment
technique combination, and relevant
information is given to enable farmers to adapt
them according to their means.

However, ICM at the field level is also strongly
dependent on the collective organization at the
scheme level (Poussin, 1995, 1998; Le Gal and
Papy, 1998). Sowing date, crop implantation
method, herbicide and fertilizer quantities are not

decided individually and irrigation depends on
water allocation rules. IRD and partners have,
therefore, developed software that integrates the
RIDEV simulation model at the scheme level
(Poussin, 2000).
