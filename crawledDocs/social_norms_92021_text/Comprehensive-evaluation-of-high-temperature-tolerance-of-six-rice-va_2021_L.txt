In order to compare the high temperature tolerance of six rice varieties, field experiments using interval sowing 
population were conducted to select sowing batches at high temperature and normal temperature during grain 
filling period. High filling temperature decreased significantly head milled rice rate, setback, amylose content 
and the proportion of the short chain of amylopectin, and increased obviously chalkiness, breakdown, gelati-
nization temperature, gelatinization enthalpy, and the proportion of the medium chain of amylopectin. Analysis 
of variance indicated significant differences with respect to physicochemical indexes of the starches from six rice 
varieties under high temperature during grain filling stage. In addition, five starch physicochemical indexes 
including apparent amylose content, setback, breakdown, chalkiness and gelatinization enthalpy showed more 
sensitivity to high temperature. These indexes could be considered as key indexes to evaluate the high tem-
perature tolerance of these six rice varieties. The experimental results showed that the high temperature toler-
ance  of  the  six  varieties  –  Huanghuazhan,  Y  liangyou  957,  Taiyou  390,  Tianyouhuazhan,  Zhongzao  39,  Y 
liangyou NO 1 – ranged from strong to weak. The regression equation showed similar results and indicated that 
the high temperature tolerance of different varieties could be preliminarily evaluated using the key physico-
chemical indexes of starch.   

1. Introduction 

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important cereal crops, 
feeding more than half of the world’s population to meet their dietary 
requirements (Zeng et al., 2017). Starch is the major component of rice 
grain  accounting  for  more  than  80%  of  its  total  constituents,  and 
therefore  its  physicochemical  parameters  such  as  amylose  content, 
gelatinization temperature (GT), gelatinization enthalpy (ΔH), pasting 
properties including peak viscosity (PV), the trough viscosity (TV), the 
cool-paste viscosity (CPV), the setback (SB) and the breakdown (BD), are 
usually used to predict cooking and eating quality of rice (ECQ) (Kong, 
Zhu, Sui, & Bao, 2015; Calingacion et al., 2014). In general, the amylose 

content measured is mainly apparent amylose content (AAC), which 
cannot truly reflect the rice quality. The combined assay of AAC and 
pasting properties being measured using a Rapid Visco-Analyzer (RVA) 
were reported to be more effective method of evaluating the rice quality 
(Jia, Ding, Wang, & Deng, 2008). BD and SB could be used to distinguish 
different rice varieties with variations in AAC (Wu, Shu, & Xia, 2001). 
GT and ΔH measured by DSC are closely related to the crystal structure 
of rice, which determines the cooking time, and also two of the most 
important starch physicochemical indexes to evaluate ECQ (Yao et al., 
2020). 
Global warming has increased the mean daily average temperature 
at  rice  growing  season  therefore  being  a  threat  to  rice  production,

Changsha City, Hunan Province. The rice materials were respectively 
sowed on March 30, April 9, April 19, April 29, May 9, May 19, May 29, 
June 8, June 18, June 28 and transplanted accordingly on April 27, May 
4, May 15, May 27, June 5, June 14, June 25, July 4, July 14, July 23, 
and all varieties were arranged in three replications within each sowing 
batches. The field sowing, transplanting, management and taking sam-
ples methods were the same for all varieties of the three batches of rice 
used on our experiment (Yao et al., 2020). Air temperature was recorded 
by the temperature data log (HOBO, Onset Computer Corp, Bourne, MA, 
USA) being installed 100 cm above the soil in the field. 
2.2. Experimental samples preparation 

D. Yao et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
especially because rice varieties are most sensitive to high temperature 
during the grain filling period (Fan et al., 2019). The daily average 
filling temperature higher than 27 ◦C will greatly influence the physi-
cochemical properties of rice starch, resulting to the deterioration of rice 
quality (Deng et al., 2015; Wakamatsu, Sasaki, Uezono, & Tanaka, 2007; 
Zhu et al., 2019). Previous studies showed that high temperature at 
grain-filling stage could increase chalkiness degree (CHA), GT, ΔH and 
significantly  changed  the  relative  crystallinity,  while  there  was  no 
change in crystal type and the ratio of length and width (Yao et al., 2020; 
Yamakawa,  Hirose,  Kuroda,  &  Yamaguchi,  2007;  Lin  et  al.,  2010; 
Umemoto  &  Terashima,  2002;  Zhong,  Cheng,  Wen,  Sun,  &  Zhang, 
2005).  The  starch  pasting  property  detected  by  RVA  analysis  was 
affected by high temperature at grain-filling stage, but the response of 
RVA profiles characteristics to high temperature was different and the 
changes of SB and BD were more significant than PV, TV and CPV, which 
meant that SB and BD might be more sensitive to high temperature 
(Zhong et al., 2005; Chun, Lee, Hamaker, & Janaswamy, 2015; Liu et al., 
2013). One of the most effective measures of preventing high temper-
ature stress is to breed and select rice varieties that are tolerant to high 
temperature. Therefore, the accurate identification and evaluation of 
the high temperature tolerance of rice germplasms are very important 
for breeders, as this will help them in properly selecting which rice 
varieties to use. However, a lot of researches focused on the effect of 
high  temperature  on  rice  quality  and  rice  starch  physicochemical 
properties using greenhouse temperature control conditions, which was 
recently  controversial,  since  extrapolating  results  from  greenhouse 
could not be fully adopted in actual production (Zhang et al., 2016). We 
investigated the effect of high temperature on rice quality by means of 
natural field temperature via sowing on different dates and the results 
could provide more comprehensive and practical data to breeders. 
Previous studies revealed that complex relationships were associated 
with rice quality indexes and each index had a different response to high 
temperature, so it was difficult to evaluate the high temperature toler-
ance of different rice varieties comprehensively and accurately with a 
single  index.  Multiple  indexes  must  be  adopted  for  comprehensive 
evaluation and these related indexes need to be transformed into new 
independent comprehensive indexes based on the principal component 
analysis (PCA) method, and the comprehensive evaluation can be made 
according to the contribution rate of each comprehensive index (Liu, 
Zhao, Li, & Chen, 2018; Liu, Zheng, & Ding, 2008; Maione & Barbosa, 
2019). Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure physico-
chemical properties of rice starch at grain filling period via sowing on 
different dates to illustrate the effect mechanism of high temperature at 
grain-filling stage and further identify the key physicochemical indexes 
of starch being used to evaluate the high temperature tolerance among 
different rice varieties (Lange et al., 2019; Yang, Wang, & Zhou, 2003; 
Yano et al., 2019). Based on our previous work, we had reported the 
effect of high temperature on the physicochemical properties of rice 
starch during the grain filling period (Yao et al., 2020). In 2019, the ten 
sowing batches with six rice varieties were conducted to select sowing 
batches at high temperature and normal temperature during grain filling 
period to evaluate the high temperature tolerance of the varieties based 
on key starch physiochemical indexes. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Plant material and field arrangement 

After physiological maturation, six individual plants were randomly 
selected for each variety in each sowing period, and all the panicles on 
the six individual plants were collected, then immediately placed in a 
35 ◦C oven to dry until the rice moisture reached 14% (Zhu et al., 2019). 
All rice panicles were then threshed, dehulled, milled, and polished. The 
polished rice was analyzed for appearance and milling qualities. Starch 
extracted  from  the  rice  flour  was  used  to  measure  a  series  of 
starch-related physicochemical indexes. Starch was extracted using the 
alkaline steeping method (Yao et al., 2020). In brief, the dried polished 
rice sample was immersed in a 0.14% sodium bisulfate solution at room 
temperature for 24 h. The steeped grain sample was mixed with enough 
0.14% sodium bisulfate solution and ground into a slurry. The milled 
slurry was filtered through a 200-mesh sieve and then centrifuged at 3, 
000 rpm for 20 min. The faint-colored supernatant was removed, while 
the remaining sediment was re-suspended in MilliQ water and centri-
fuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 min; this process was repeated five times. The 
isolated starch was placed in an oven at 55 ◦C to dry rapidly, and then 
the dried starch was ground to pass through a 200-mesh sieve and kept 
in a dryer. 
2.3. Determination of starch physicochemical indexes 

According  to  the  temperature  data,  the  sowing  batches  at  high 
temperature  and  normal  temperature  during  the  filling  period  were 
screened, and the physicochemical indexes of starch of six rice varieties 
at high temperature and normal temperature were determined. At the 
same time, the response difference of the same starch physicochemical 
index to high temperature and normal temperature was determined by 
random sampling respectively in all plots of sowing batches of the high 
temperature and normal temperature of six rice varieties with three 
replicates in each sowing batch. 
Brown rice rate, polished rice rate, head milled rice rate, the ratio of 
grain  length  to  width,  and  CHA  were  determined  to  evaluate  grain 
milling and appearance quality according to our previous method (Yao 
et  al.,  2020).  Rice  starch  isolation,  AAC,  gelatinization  properties, 
pasting property were determined to evaluate the effect of the physi-
cochemical properties of rice starch using the methods described by Yao 
et al. (2020). 
Starch chain  length  distribution was  determined  by  ICS5000  ion 
chromatography  system  (ICS-5000,  Thermo  Fisher  Scientific,  Sunny-
vale, America) as performed by Nishi, Nakamura, Tanaka, and Satoh 
(2001) with a minor modification. The Dionex™  CarboPac™  PA200 
(3.0  × 250 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sunnyvale, America) ionic 
column was used according to the properties of the glucose chain. Mo-
bile phase A (aqueous solution), mobile phase B (100 mM NaOH, 1M 
NaAC) and mobile phase C (100 mM NaOH) were used, the flow rate 
controlled at 0.4 ml/min, and the column temperature at 30 ◦C. 
2.4. Comprehensive evaluation of high temperature tolerance 

In order to eliminate the influence of variety specificity, character 
stress indexes (I) of physicochemical properties for all rice varieties were 

Six rice varieties – Huanghuazhan, Y liangyou 957, Tianyouhuazhan, 
Taiyou 390, Y liangyou NO 1, and Zhongzao 39 – were used as the 
experimental  materials  in  this  study  and  respectively  numbered 
19Q001, 19Q002, 19Q003, 19Q004, 19Q005 and 19Q006, all of which 
were provided by Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Centre. In 2019, ten 
sowing batches were set up in order to cover sowing dates of all kinds of 
rice varieties and help select the maximum temperature difference be-
tween two sowing batches. Field experiments were conducted at the 

LWT148(2021)1118042D. Yao et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
calculated  as  the  experimental  data  to  evaluate  high  temperature 
tolerance of different rice varieties. These physicochemical properties 
were respectively measured at high temperature and normal tempera-
ture treatment, viz character values under high temperature (PVHT) and 
character values under normal temperature (PVCT). Character stress 
indexes were calculated by means of previous methods (Nachimuthu 
et al., 2014; Huang, Luo, Huang, Rao, & Liu, 1999) with minor modi-
fications  as  follows:  I  = PVHT/PVCT  or  I=PVCT/PVHT.  If  physico-
chemical  properties  under  high  temperature  increased,  the  former 
formula was used, the latter was used if otherwise. PCA was used to 
change key physicochemical indexes relevant to each other into several 
independent comprehensive indexes by SPSS 24.0 software (Yano et al., 
2019).  The  corresponding  subordinative  function  value  (U)  of  each 
comprehensive 
formula:  UX  =
(X-Xmin)/(Xmax -Xmin). X is a comprehensive index of a certain variety in 
one  rice  varieties’  group  and  Ux  is  its  corresponding  subordinative 
function value. Xmax and Xmin are respectively the maximum and the 

minimum value of the comprehensive index for all the test variety in this 
group (Jiang et al., 2014). Further, the weight (W) was determined by 
the ratio of each principal component contribution to the total contri-
bution rate of all principal components, and the comprehensive evalu-
ation value (D) was determined by the accumulation of the product of UX 
value and WX, and the formula: D =
[Ux∗Wx] (x = 1, 2, ……n), where 
n represented the last comprehensive index. 
2.5. Statistical analysis 

All parameters shown in the tables and figures used in this article 
represented the mean values of the experimental data obtained from 
triplicate tests for all varieties sown during the ten sowing batches. The 
analysis of all data was performed using the SPSS 24.0 statistical soft-
ware program. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s tests were 
used to determine whether statistically significant differences (P < 0.05)

The first, the sixth, and the tenth sowing batches were selected as 
experimental materials based on their obviously different mean daily 
average temperature of 30 days (MDT) after the heading stage except 
19Q006 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The first and sixth sowing 
batches of all the other varieties except 19Q006 were considered as high 
temperature treatment groups (HT1 and HT2) with MDT higher than 
27  ◦C,  and  the  MDT  of  the  tenth  sowing  batch  was  22–27  ◦C  and 
considered as the normal temperature treatment (CT). For 19Q006 with 
a short growth period compared with the other five varieties, the sixth, 
the seventh and the tenth sowing batches were selected as the experi-
mental  materials,  represented  as  HT1,  HT2,  and  CT,  respectively. 
Obviously, the daily average temperature of HT1 was higher than HT2, 
and the highest daily average temperature difference existed between 
HT1 and CT. Meanwhile, the daily mean temperature of 30 days after 
heading was higher than 29 ◦C for all varieties at HT1 treatment group, 
meaning that the duration time of high temperature stress lasted up to 
30 days, while the continuous time of the daily mean temperature higher 
than 29 ◦C for all varieties at HT2 treatment group exceeded 12 days, 
showing that all varieties had suffered with continuous high tempera-
ture for more than 12 days. 
3.2. Effects of high temperature on rice milling and appearance qualities 
The  effects  of  high  temperature  on  the  indexes  of  milling  and 
appearance qualities were shown in Supplementary Table 2. As per our 
previous studies (Yao et al., 2020), high temperature at grain filling 
stage did not change brown rice rate and polished rice rate, but signif-
icantly increased (P < 0.05) CHA and decreased head milled rice rate. 
Except for 19Q004 and 19Q006, the ratio of grain length to width had a 
significant decline under high temperature, which was contradictory 
with our previous study showing that high temperature had no signifi-
cant effect on ratio of grain length to width. Except for 19Q004, CHA 
showed a deterioration under both HT1 and HT2 for the other varieties. 
Especially, as the temperature rose, the CHA increased even more for 
19Q002 and 19Q006. Head milled rice rate showed only a decreasing 
trend under HT1 treatment for 19Q002, 19Q003, 19Q004, 19Q005. The 
above results indicated that CHA was more sensitive to high temperature 
comparing with other indexes of milling and appearance qualities.

rice starch

for 19Q001, 19Q002, 19Q004 and 19Q005. The AAC did not obviously 
change  under  HT1  and  HT2  for  19Q003  and  19Q006.  Moreover, 
different varieties were affected on different degrees by high tempera-
ture, for example, 19Q002 showed a significant decrease as the tem-
perature rose, while the other varieties did not exhibit this trend. High 
temperature caused little or no significant change in PV, TV and CPV, 
but significantly increased BD except 19Q003, GT (onset, T0; peak, Tp; 
conclusion, Tc) and  ΔH, and decreased SB for all varieties (Table 1, 
Table 2). SB of RVA were calculated by a relative value (setback value/ 
peak value). Setback value equal peak viscosity minus trough viscosity. 
For amylopectin chain length distribution (Fig. 2), except for 19Q001, 
the proportion of the short chain, ranging from DP 6-18, significantly 
decreased with the increasing filling-grain temperature. The amount of 
medium chain ranging from DP 21 to 33 clearly increased, while the 
longer chain above DP 34 did not obviously change when the filling- 
grain temperature increased further. For 19Q001, the chain with DP 
6-10  obviously  decreased  and  the  chain  ranging  from  DP  11  to  20 

Data  are  shown  as  the  mean  ± standard  error  of  triplicate  measurements. 
Different letters are followed after standard deviation to express significantly 
different (P < 0.05). 19Q001, 19Q002, 19Q003, 19Q004, 19Q005 and 19Q006 
represent  respectively  the  rice  varieties  of  Huanghuazhan,  Y  liangyou  957,

significantly increased, and the longer chain with above DP 21 had a 
little change with the increasing filling-grain temperature. Similarly for 
19Q005,  the  chain  above  DP  20  did  not  have  a  significant  change. 
Therefore, the proportion of the short chain of amylopectin obviously 
decreased,  while  the  proportion  of  the  medium  chain  significantly 
increased as the filling-grain temperature increased, which promoted 
the formation of more perfect crystals (Xiong et al., 2021). Additionally, 
the proportion of the medium and long chain of amylopectin was highly 
positive correlated with gelatinization properties measured by DSC (Lin

et al., 2016), which indicated polished rice treated at high temperature 
during grain-filling period might need more energy and higher tem-
perature to melt starch crystals, resulting to the polished rice being more 
difficult to cook. 

3.4. Physicochemical indexes of rice starch closely related to high- 
temperature tolerance 

The response difference of the same starch physicochemical index to 
high temperature and normal temperature was determined on 54 plots 
of six varieties with three sowing batches (the first, sixth and tenth 
sowing batches of 19Q001-19Q005 and the sixth, seventh and tenth 
sowing batches of 19Q006) and three replicates in each sowing batch to 
study the effects of HT1 and HT2 on the same physicochemical indexes 
(Table 3). The results showed that there were no significant changes in 
brown rice rate, polished rice rate and length-width ratio under the two 
temperature conditions (the data were not provided), while PV and CPV 
only  increased  significantly  under  HT1  stress,  but  did  not  change 
significantly under HT2 stress. However, AAC, BD and SB increased 
significantly under HT1 and HT2 conditions, especially AAC and SB 
reached an extremely significant level, indicating that AAC, BD and SB 
were  more  sensitive  to  high  temperature  than  PV  and  CPV.  From 
Table 3, we could find that chalkiness degree in HT2 reached significant 
levels and extremely significant levels by HT1 stress, while head milled 
rice rate, T0, Tp, Tc and ΔH reached significant levels under these two 
kinds of high temperature. The analysis of variation coefficients (CV) of 
all the indexes measured for two consecutive years using different va-
rieties with different sowing dates showed that AAC, BD, SB, CHA and 
ΔH  had  higher  coefficients  of  variation  (Supplementary  Table  3). 
Meanwhile, these indexes had more significant changes under higher 
grain-filling temperature indicating that they were more sensitive than 
the other indexes. Therefore, combining the significance analysis and CV 
analysis under high temperature conditions, AAC, BD, SB, CHA and ΔH 
were considered as the key physicochemical indexes of rice starch to 
evaluate the high temperature tolerance of different varieties. 

3.5. Comprehensive evaluation of high temperature tolerance of different 
varieties 

PCA  was  used  to  transform  multiple  indexes  into  independent 
comprehensive indexes to evaluate accurately high temperature toler-
ance of different varieties to provide more reliable theoretical data to 

breeders (Deepa et al., 2009). Taking CT as control, HT1 and HT2 were 
considered as two high temperature treatment conditions so that the 
experiments  could  be  divided  into  two  comparison  groups,  namely 
HT1/CT and HT2/CT. The stress degree of each physicochemical index 
under high temperature was evaluated by character stress index under 
two treatment groups and the standard data analyzed using the SPSS 
software were shown in Supplementary Table 4. The D value was ob-
tained by the PCA by changing ΔH, BD, SB, CHA, AAC relevant to each 
other into two or three independent comprehensive indexes to estimate 
the extent to resist high temperature. At HT1/CT treatment group, three 
principal components including F1, F2 and F3 were obtained by PCA 
with cumulative contribution rate of 96%, which could cover almost all 
the information of key physiological index. F1 explained 40.9% of the 
total variance (Table 4), and CHA and SB showed respectively high 
positive  loading  (0.958)  and  negative  loading  ((cid:0) 0.910),  which  sug-
gested that the varieties with high principal component value of F1 
exhibited high chalkiness and low SB values after high temperature 
treatment. F2 explained 34.4% of the total variance and the loading of 
BD was high on F2 (0.968), indicating that F2 was representative of BD. 
F3 explained 24.7% of the total variance and represented AAC (0.972). 
This component was also loaded with △H (0.669), which was consistent 
with the previous results that varieties with high AAC needed more 
energy to melt starch crystals (Lacerda, Leite, & da Silveira, 2019). Due 
to the high variance contribution rate of F1 and F2, CHA, SB and BD 
contributed  the  most  to  evaluate  the  high  temperature  tolerance  of 
different varieties. For the HT2/CT treatment group, three principal 
components were obtained with cumulative contribution rate of 98%. 
The principal components and its coefficient were shown in Table 4 at 
two groups. F1, F2 and F3 represented respectively BD and SB, CHA and 
△H,  AAC.  According  to  the  high  variance  contribution  rates  of  F1 
(47.4%) and F2 (31.4%), CHA, SB and BD were the most key indexes to 
evaluate the high temperature tolerance of different rice varieties, which 
was consistent with the results from the HT1/CT treatment group. Ac-
cording to the standard data of character stress index and principal 
component coefficient of each index, the principal component value was 
calculated. U, W and D value was shown in Table 5. According to D 
value,  the  high  temperature  tolerance  of  the  cultivars  ranging  from 
strong to weak was evaluated, viz the high temperature tolerance of the 
six  varieties  was  evaluated  in  the  same  order  under  HT1  and  HT2 
treatment, with the following varieties arranged from strong to weak – 
19Q001, 19Q002, 19Q004, 19Q003, 19Q006, 19Q005. The same results 
of high temperature tolerance were obtained in the two groups, which

19Q001, 19Q002, 19Q003, 19Q004, 19Q005 and 19Q006 represent respectively the rice varieties of Huanghuazhan, Y liangyou 957, Tianyouhuazhan, Taiyou 390, Y 
liangyou NO 1 and Zhongzao 39. F1, F2, F3 are respectively three principal components obtained by PCA. HT1 and HT2 represent the corresponding high temperature 
processed sowing batches. 

indicated that the high temperature tolerance of the varieties had similar 
internal response mechanism under these two kinds of high temperature 
conditions. Taking the comprehensive evaluation value as the depen-
dent  variable  and  the  character  stress  indexes  of  five  key  physico-
chemical  indexes  as  the  independent  variables,  the  multiple  linear 
regression equation was established under HT1 stress, D  = -0.961  +
0.582*BD-0.174*SB-0.115*AAC+1.144*CHA+0.910*ΔH.  The  deter-
mining coefficient of the equation was 0.99, viz R2 = 0.99,meaning that 
these key indexes could comprehensively evaluate high temperature 
tolerance of these six rice varieties. The regression equation under HT2 
stress  was  obtained 
same  way,  D  = -1.893  +
1.463*BD-0.484*SB+1.430*AAC+2.604*CHA-1.454*ΔH, 
the 
determining coefficient of the equation was 0.99, viz R2  = 0.99. The 
predicted high temperature tolerance (FV) of the six rice varieties ac-
cording to the regression equation was shown in Table 5 being almost 
the same as the D value obtained. The above results showed that the 
regression equation based on the character stress index of the five key 
indexes of the six varieties could be used to quantitatively evaluate the 
high temperature tolerance of the six varieties, and the reliability of the 
method used in this study was also demonstrated. 
4. Discussion 

and 

the 

in 

High temperature seriously affected the physicochemical character-
istics of rice starch, which resulted in poor rice quality, but different 
physicochemical indexes had different responses to high temperature 

stress (Mishra, Shekhar, Agrawal, Chakraborty, & Chakraborty, 2017). 
We obtained five key physicochemical indexes including AAC, BD, SB, 
Chalkiness and △H that were significantly affected by high temperature 
at grain filling stage and had large CV during different varieties and 
different sowing periods. With these five key indexes, the high tem-
perature tolerance of six rice varieties were evaluated by means of PCA, 
respectively from strong to weak 19Q001, 19Q002, 19Q004, 19Q003, 
19Q006, 19Q005. 
The frequency of hot weather during grain filling stage dramatically 
decreased  head  polished  rate,  and  increased  CHA  caused  by  the 
impairment of starch accumulation or other biosynthetic pathways in 
the grain (Sreenivasulu et al., 2015). At the same time, the physico-
chemical  properties  of  milled  rice  starch,  including  gelatinization 
characteristics, pasting property, starch chain length distribution and so 
on, were also significantly affected by high temperature (Chun et al., 
2015). Starch is the main component of milled rice and its physico-
chemical properties determine cooking and eating quality. The five key 
indexes  obtained  were  all  closely  related  to  starch  physicochemical 
properties in this paper, so we demonstrated that starch-related physi-
cochemical indexes could be used to  evaluate the  high temperature 
tolerance of different rice varieties. 
The composition and structure of rice starch are mainly affected by 
genetic and environmental factors. The changes of starch composition 
and structure under high temperature are mainly related to enzymes 
involved in starch synthesis. High temperature during grain filling stage 
inhibited  the  activities  of  adenosine  diphosphate  glucose  (ADPG)

enzyme,  soluble  starch  synthase  and  granule-bound  starch  synthase 
(GBSS), which was not conducive to the accumulation of starch, thus 
leading to a significant decrease for amylose content (Yan et al., 2008). 
In addition, high temperature during grain-filling stage could promote 
the activity of soluble starch branching enzyme (soluble Q enzyme), but 
the activity of starch debranching enzyme (DBE) decreased. Therefore, 
high temperature at grain filling stage could promote short chain of 
amylopectin to synthesize the medium and long chains of amylopectin 
(Bao et al., 2020). 
Changes in starch composition and structure led to the according 
changes in starch physicochemical properties (Bao et al., 2020). Our 
results showed that high temperature during grain-filling stage signifi-
cantly increased chalkiness, mainly because 6–20 days after anthesis 
was the key period for the formation of rice chalkiness. During this 
period, rice varieties exposed to high temperature would increase the 
space between starch granules, leading to the increase of chalkiness 
(Sheng, Tao, & Chen, 2007). Studies have shown that GT was negatively 
correlated with the content of amylose, and positively correlated with 
the proportion of medium and long chains of amylopectin. Therefore, 
the increase of GT and ΔH might be due to the decrease of amylose 
content and the increase of the medium chains of amylopectin under 
high temperature (Kong et al., 2015; Dou et al., 2018). Previous studies 
showed that the branching structure of amylopectin mainly affected GT 
and  crystallinity,  while  amylose  was  the  main  factor  affecting  the 
pasting  properties  measured  by  RVA  (Rehmani  et  al.,  2014).  The 
amylose content of the six rice varieties used in this study was different, 
so the changes of relevant parameters of pasting properties under high 
temperature were varieties dependent, which indicated that a single 
index could not evaluate the high temperature tolerance of different rice 
varieties. Generally, rice varieties with low SB, CHA, ΔH and high BD 
had better ECQ (Mo et al., 2020). Meantime, BD, SB and CHA were 
thought to be biggest contribution in comprehesive evaluation of high 
temperature tolerance of different rice varieties. Therefore, PCA of the 
key physicochemical indexes should be carried out in the comprehensive 
evaluation of high temperature tolerance. The variance contribution 
rate of each key index in the principal component should be weighed, 
which can better help breeders to develop high-temperature tolerance 
rice varieties with good rice quality.
