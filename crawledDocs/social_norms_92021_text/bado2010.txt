Abstract The effects of 18 years continuous crop-
ping of irrigated rice on soil and yields were studied
in two long-term fertility experiments (LTFE) at
Ndiaye and Fanaye in the Senegal River Valley
(West Africa). Rice was planted twice in a year
during the hot dry season (HDS) and wet season
(WS) with different fertilizer treatments. Soil organic
carbon (SOC) under fallow varied from 7.1 g kg-1 at
Fanaye to 11.0 g kg-1 at Ndiaye. Rice cropping
maintained and increased SOC at Ndiaye and Fanaye,
respectively and fertilizer treatments did not affect
SOC. Soil available P and exchangeable K were
maintained or increased with long-term application of
NPK fertilizers. Without
any fertilizer, yields
decreased by 60 kg ha-1 (1.5%) and 115 kg ha-1
(3%) per year at Fanaye and Ndiaye, respectively.
The highest annual yield decreases of 268 kg ha-1
(3.6%) and 277 kg ha-1 (4.1%) were observed at
Fanaye and Ndiaye,
respectively when only N
fertilizer was applied. Rice yields were only main-
tained with NPK fertilizers supplying at least 60 kg
N, 26 kg P and 50 kg K ha-1. It was concluded that
the double cropping of
irrigated rice does not
decrease SOC and the application of the recom-
mended doses of NPK fertilizer maintained rice
yields for 18 years.

Introduction

Weak soil buffering capacity due to low soil organic
carbon (SOC) and clay content, low cation exchange
capacity (CEC) and P deﬁciency are the main
limiting factors to agricultural productivity of the
upland soils of West Africa. Data from many long-
term experiments in upland soils usually show yield
declines over time as a consequence of a decrease in
soil organic carbon (SOC), soil acidiﬁcation and a
decrease of nutrient use efﬁciency (Bationo and
Mokwunye 1991; Bado et al. 1997; Bationo 2008). In
contrast to the poor upland soils, lowland soils of the
inland valleys have generally higher organic carbon
and clay contents, a better CEC and water retention
capacity,
crop
production.

As with Asia, rice has become the most important
cereal crop of the inland valleys of West Africa. Rice
is cultivated as a staple food by farmers in the small
inland valleys, or as a cash crop in many irrigated
schemes. Consequently,
the cropping systems are
becoming more and more intensiﬁed and, whenever
possible, many farmers grow two rice crops (during
the wet and hot dry seasons) per year. While the
simulated potential yield of

8–12 tonnes ha-1 (Dingkuhn and Sow 1997),
the
average yields in farmers’ ﬁelds vary from 4 to 6
tonnes ha-1 (Haefele et al. 2002; Kebbeh and Miezan
2003). This means that there is scope for increasing
rice yields with the sustainable intensiﬁcation of the
existing cropping systems.

The long-term and intensive cultivation of rice
with periodical ﬂooding can affect the dynamics of
SOC, soil pH, cation exchange capacity and nutrient
use efﬁciency (Kenneth et al. 1997). A key research
question is whether long-term intensive lowland rice-
rice cropping in the irrigated schemes is sustainable.
Some results from long-term experiments in Asia
showed yield declines of 70 to more
than
200 kg ha-1 with best management practices over a
period of 10–24 years (Flinn and De Datta 1984;
Cassman et al. 1995; Kenneth et al. 1997). There is
very little information on soil changes and rice crop
yields in long-term intensive rice cultivation in
Africa. Working with only 10 years data on two
long-term fertility experiments (LTFE)
in West
Africa, Haefele et al. (2002, 2004) found a slight
but not signiﬁcant yield decline (-27 kg ha-1 per
season) at one site and a signiﬁcant yield increase
(?86 kg ha-1 per season) at other site. A non-
signiﬁcant decrease in SOC was also observed. The
authors recognized that because of the short duration
of the experiments (10 years) and climatic inﬂuences,
the observed yield trends could not give an accurate
indication of the biophysical sustainability of the
cropping system.

The overall objective of this study was to assess the
sustainability of rice cropping in terms of soil fertility
and yield stability using more data (18 years or 36
cropping seasons) from the same LTFE. This research
is mainly focussed on soil P and K, SOC and yield
trends under long-term intensive cropping of rice.

Materials and methods

Experimental sites

Two long-term fertility experiments (LTFE) were
carried out over a period of 18 years (1991–2008) at
AfricaRice’s research farms in Ndiaye and Fanaye,
both located in the Senegal River Valley. Ndiaye
(16°140 N, 16°140 W) is located close to the coast
(about 40 km inland) in the Senegal River delta. Soil

123

salinity at the site and in the river delta is generally
high, due to the occurrence of marine salt deposits in
the subsoil (Haefele et al. 2002). The soil proﬁle at
Ndiaye corresponds to a typical Orthithionic Gleysol
(FAO 1998). The original soil contained at
least
10 mg C kg-1 of soil and 5 mg P kg-1 (P-Bray1).
Fanaye (16°330 N, 15°460 W) is located in the middle
valley of the Senegal River, *240 km inland, where
natural soil salinity is low or absent. The soil proﬁle
in Fanaye belongs to a Eutric Vertisol (FAO 1998).
The original soil contained at least 6.5 mg C kg-1 of
soil and 4 mg P kg-1 (P-Bray1). The climate of the
two sites is characterized by a wet season (WS) with
*200 mm rainfall per year from July to October, a
cold dry season from November to February and a hot
dry season (HDS) from March to June (Dingkuhn and
Sow 1997; Haefele et al. 2002).

Agronomic experiments

The LTFE was established at Ndiaye during the hot
dry season (HDS) of 1991. The ﬁrst rice crop was
cultivated to homogenize soil fertility variability with
the rice cultivar SIPI 692033, planted with a uniform
application of NPK fertilizer supplying 120, 26 and
50 kg ha-1 of N, P and K, respectively. At Fanaye,
soil fertility variability was homogenized by growing
different cultivars of rice during the cold dry season
with the same uniform dose of NPK fertilizer used at
Ndiaye. From 1991 to 1997, the medium duration
cultivar Jaya was used in the WS and the short
duration cultivar IR 50 in the HDS. From the WS of
1997 (Ndiaye) and the HDS of 1998 (Fanaye), both
cultivars were replaced by Sahel 108, a short duration
cultivar (Mie´zan and Diack 1994).

Six fertilizer treatments with four

replications
were laid out in a randomized complete block design.
Experimental plots measured 25 m2 (5 9 5 m) and
were separated by small 30 cm high dikes. The six
fertilizer treatments were: a control (without any
fertilizer); the recommended dose of N without PK
fertilizer (120 kg N ha-1, 0 kg P ha-1, 0 kg K ha-1);
the recommended dose of NPK fertilizer (R_NPK)
supplying 120 kg N ha-1, 26 kg P ha-1 and 50 kg K
ha-1); low dose of N-medium PK fertilizer (L_NPK:
60 kg N ha-1, 26 kg P ha-1 and 50 kg K ha-1); high
dose of N-medium PK fertilizer (H_NPK: 180 kg N
ha-1, 26 kg P ha-1 and 50 kg K ha-1); and medium
dose of N-high PK fertilizer (M_NPK: 120 kg N

ha-1, 52 kg P ha-1 and 100 kg K ha-1). Urea (46%
N), ammonium phosphate (18% N and 20% P) and
potassium chloride (47% K) were used.

Rice seedlings were transplanted at the rate of 25
hills m-2. Crop management was adjusted to the
farmers’ practice. For all fertilizer treatments, 50% N,
100% P and 100% K were broadcast at 21 days after
transplanting. The remaining N dose was split-
applied at panicle initiation (25%) and 10 days
before ﬂowering (25%). Herbicide (6 l ha-1 Propa-
nyl) and manual weeding were used for weed control.
Herbicide was applied once at 21 days after sowing,
1 day before the ﬁrst N application; thereafter, plots
were kept weed-free by manual weeding. Insecticides
(Furadan) were sometimes used at 25 kg ha-1 for
pest control at
tillering, maximum
tillering, panicle initiation and ﬂowering. A constant
water layer of 10-15 cm was maintained during the
whole cropping season and the harvested straw was
removed from the plots every season. Rice grain
yields were determined from a 4 m2 harvest area in
each plot at maturity and reported at a standard water
content of 140 g water kg-1 fresh weight.

Soil sampling and analysis

in the absence of

Soil from each of the six fertilizer treatments were
sampled at the end of the dry season of 2007 (after
17 years of cultivation). Data of the original soils of
the two sites are already published (Haefele et al.
2002). However,
the original
database with repeated values, it was not possible to
conduct an analysis of variance in comparison with
soil samples from the experimental plots. We have
selected some uncultivated areas (native fallow)
around the experiments to serve as a reference. These
areas also received the same water regimes (ﬂooding
and aeration) as the experimental plots. The sub-
samples were mixed thoroughly to get a composite
sample, air-dried immediately after collection and
dried in the laboratory at 60°C for 1 week. The
samples were analyzed in the soil
laboratory at
AfricaRice. Soil organic C was determined using the
wet digestion method (Walkley and Black 1934).
Available soil phosphorous was determined by the
Bray-P1 method using the extractant 0.03 N NH4F in
0.025 N HCl (Bray and Kurtz 1945). Soil exchange-
able K (Kexch) was extracted with 1 M NH4OACc
solution (Helmke and Sparks 1996).

Statistical data analysis

The statistical analyses of the rice yields were ﬁrstly
done using the four factors: year, site, season and
fertilizer treatments (Gomez and Gamez 1983). The
SAS software was used for data calculations (SAS
Inst. 1995). The relationships between rice yield
variations and years of cultivation were tested with
different models before selecting the simple linear
model which better described the
relationship
between the two factors (Eq. 1):

where Y = rice grain yields (dependent variable), X =

regression, respectively (Gomez and Gamez 1983).

Results and discussion

Soil organic carbon, phosphorous and potassium

The mean soil organic carbon (SOC) of the uncultivated
soil was higher (P \ 0.01) at Ndiaye (11.0 g kg-1) than
Fanaye (7.1 g kg-1) (Table 1). Data of the original soil
also indicated that the site of Ndiaye contained more
carbon (10.0 g kg-1) than Fanaye (6.6 g kg-1) (Haef-
ele et al. 2004). At Ndiaye, SOC varied from
10.6 g kg-1 in the control (without fertilizer) plots to
12.3 g kg-1 in the high N fertilizer-medium PK
treatment, with no signiﬁcant differences between the
fertilizer treatments. At Fanaye, SOC ranged from
12.9 g kg-1 in the control plots to 13.6 g kg-1 in the
plots receiving the recommended NPK treatment. SOC
was not decreased by long-term cultivation at either site
but was even increased at Fanaye.

Soil extractable P-Bray 1 of the uncultivated soil
was very low (3.8 mg P kg-1 at Fanaye and 4.9 mg P
kg-1 at Ndiaye). All NPK fertilizer
treatments
increased soil extractable P at the two sites (Table 1).
The soil available P ranged from 5.3 mg P kg-1
(control without any fertilizer) to 19.7 mg kg-1 in the
medium N fertilizer-high PK treatment at Ndiaye and
from 3.8 (control) to 7.1 mg kg-1 in the medium N
fertilizer-high PK treatment at Fanaye.

While soil exchangeable K (Kexch) was affected by
fertilizer application at Fanaye, Kexch was not
affected by fertilizer treatments at Ndiaye. In general,

soil Kexch was increased at the two sites with the
application of K fertilizers. The lowest levels of Kexch
were also noted at the two sites with the high doses
(180 kg N ha-1) of N fertilizers (Table 1).

Grain yields were highly affected by fertilizer applica-

site
(P \ 0.0001). However, grain yields were not affected
by the season (Table 2). Signiﬁcant simple interactions
(site-season; site-year; site-fertilizer; year-site; season-
site and year-fertilizer), triple interactions (site-year-
season; site-season-fertilizer; year-season-fertilizer and
site-year-fertilizer), and quadruple interaction (site-
year-season-fertilizer) were observed on grain yields.

The parameters of the linear regression models
used to analyze grain yield trends over the 18 years
are presented in Table 3. The intercepts of the linear
regression summarize the mean grain yields during
the ﬁrst year of cultivation. Considering the yield
trends (Table 3; Figs. 1, 2),
two main groups of
fertilizer treatments were identiﬁed: (1) the control
treatment and the recommended N dose alone
without PK, and (2) the NPK treatments.

Long-term cultivation without fertilizer application
decreased grain yields—by 115 kg ha-1 per year, with
a conﬁdence interval of 59–259 kg ha-1 (P \ 0.05) at
Ndiaye during the WS (Table 3). The same practice
induced an annual yield loss of 60 kg ha-1 at Fanaye
during the same WS. Thus,
long-term cultivation
without fertilizer decreased rice yields by 1.5% per
year at Fanaye and 3% at Ndiaye during the WS. While
a high yield of 7 Mg ha-1 was obtained in the ﬁrst year
of cultivation, N-fertilizer application alone induced
the highest annual yield decreases at both sites during
the two seasons (Table 1; Figs. 1, 2). The rice yield
decreased by268 kg ha-1 (-3.6%) at Fanaye and
277 kg ha-1 (-4.1%) at Ndiaye during the WS. A
signiﬁcant yield decrease of 147 kg ha-1 was
observed during the HDS at Ndiaye (Table 3). With
the NPK treatments, there was no signiﬁcant linear
relationship (P [ 0.05) between yield variations and
years. Otherwise, no signiﬁcant yield decline was
observed at the two sites when NPK fertilizers were
applied (Table 3; Figs. 1, 2). However, slight (and
(P [ 0.05) were
nonsigniﬁcant) yield decreases
always observed during the WS at both sites while
NPK fertilizers
seemed to increase rice yields
(P [ 0.05) during the HDS.

Discussion

In comparison with the uncultivated soil, SOC was
maintained at
the same level at Ndiaye or even
increased at Fanaye with rice cropping. Working on
the same two LTFE, Haefele et al. (2004) also
reported a higher SOC in cultivated soils at one site
(Fanaye), while a slight but nonsigniﬁcant decreasing
trend of SOC was observed at the other site (Ndiaye).
Probably because of the limited amount of data (three
sample dates) and special variability,
the authors
recognized that they could not conclude that SOC did
not change. Unfortunately, soil samples were not
taken every year in the LTFE and there are insufﬁ-
cient data to assess the trends of SOC over years. Our
data also conﬁrm higher SOC in the cultivated soil at
Fanaye and treatments with NPK fertilizer applica-
tions always had higher SOC. Consequently, we can
at least conclude that SOC did not decrease with rice
cropping and this is true at the two sites but was
rather increased at one site (Fanaye).

The recycling of crop residues and roots in the
ﬂooded conditions of
irrigated rice systems can
explain the status of SOC. The decomposition of
plant residues is typically slower in submerged than
in aerated soil (Powlson and Olk 2000; Regmi et al.
2002; Sahrawat 2004; Zhang and He 2004; Mirasol
et al. 2008). Crop residues are continuously recycled in
the soil twice a year as a source of carbon, which are
incorporated into young soil organic matter fraction

(Cassman et al. 1995; Olk et al. 1996, 2000; Bronson
et al. 1997; Witt et al. 2000). A signiﬁcant increase of
SOC was observed at Fanaye, probably because of the
initial low level of SOC. After 17 years of cultivation,
there was no signiﬁcant difference in SOC between the
cultivated soils at the two sites. The SOC had increased
in the low C content soil at Fanaye to the same level as
at Ndiaye. The buildup of SOC by periodical anaerobic
conditions seamed to raise SOC to an equilibrium of
11–13 mg C kg-1. More signiﬁcant increases of SOC
would probably not occur during the forthcoming
years.

Low yields and signiﬁcant decreases in yields over
the years in the control treatment and N fertilizer
without PK plots may be explained by the initial poor
soil fertility status. The low levels of extractable P in
the original soil conﬁrmed the need for P-fertilizer
applications to overtake the critical limit of soil P for
rice (Bado et al. 2008). The high yields obtained with
N-fertilizer alone without PK treatment during the
ﬁrst 3 years, followed by the quick yield decline,
showed the limiting effect of these nutrients with
time of cultivation.

In general, most of the irrigated lowland valleys in
the Sahel and Sudan savannah have considerable soil
K reserves (Buri et al. 1999; Wopereis et al. 1999;
Haefele et al. 2004). Probably because of
the
relatively high soil K status, the exchangeable K of
the LTFE did not show any signiﬁcant depletion with
the recommended doses of NPK fertilizer as already

noted by Haefele et al. (2004). However, the high-
est doses of N fertilizers (180 kg N ha-1 or more)
can probably induce K depletion with long-term
cropping.

As important factor of soil fertility, the mainte-
nance or buildup of SOC in ﬂooded conditions,
coupled with the improvement of soil chemical
properties (Sahrawat 2004) and better use of nutrients
both from soil and fertilizers, can explain the yield
trends during the 18 years of cropping. Except for the
control
treatment (without any fertilizer) and the
control without PK fertilizer, rice grain yields were

maintained during the 18 years with the seasonal
applications of chemical NPK fertilizers. Using the
yields of the best NPK treatment, Haefele et al.
(2002) observed a slight and nonsigniﬁcant yield
decline (-27 kg ha-1 per season) at Ndiaye and
signiﬁcant yield increase at Fanaye (?86 kg ha-1 per
season). Otherwise, no yield declines were observed
when the three NPK nutrients were applied. The
authors recognized that because of the short duration
of the experiments (10 years) and extreme conditions
of the Sahelian climate, the observed yield trends
could not give an accurate indication of

biophysical sustainability of the cropping system.
They probably did not observe the interactions within
the factors site, season and fertilizer as we did with 36
cropping seasons (Table 2). The climatic variability
and site-speciﬁc crop management at the two sites
may explain the inﬂuence of sites and season on grain
yield (Dingkuhn and Sow 1997). Compared to the
continental zone (Fanaye), the hot dry season was
found to be most productive in the coastal zone of the
delta (Ndiaye) because of the moderate air temper-
atures in the proximity of the sea. Cold-induced
spikelet sterility that frequently affects rice yield

(Dingkuhn and Sow 1997), climatic variations and
harvest operation may explain the diverse effects of
site and season on biomass and grain yields.

The data conﬁrmed that rice yields were main-
tained over 18 years (36 seasons) of continuous
cropping, probably because of the improvement of
soil chemical fertility with ﬂooding (Sahrawat 1998)
and the maintenance of SOC and NPK nutrient status
with the seasonal applications of NPK fertilizers.
This is conﬁrmed for all the three treatments of NPK
fertilizer and not only for the best
treatment per
season as observed by Haefele et al. (2002).

Conclusions

Soil organic carbon was always maintained or
increased irrespective of fertilizer application and
rice yields declined only when rice was cultivated
without NPK fertilizer or when only N-fertilizer was
used. However, these data suggest research axes to
develop alternative and better management options of
chemical fertilizers to improve irrigated rice produc-
tivity and proﬁtability. While N should be applied
each season, it is probably not necessary to apply P
and K each season. For example, seasonal applica-
tions of N (each cropping season) and annual
applications (one season per year) of P and K can
be an option to improve fertilizer management, rice
production and proﬁtability.
