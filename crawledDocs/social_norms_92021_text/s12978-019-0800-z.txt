Socio-cultural contextual factors that
contribute to the uptake of a mobile health
intervention to enhance maternal health
care in rural Senegal
Margaret E. MacDonald1*

and Gorgui Sene Diallo2

Abstract

Background: Although considerable progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality over the past 25 years in
Senegal, the national maternal mortality ratio (MMR), at 315 deaths per 100,000 live births, is still unacceptably high. In
recent years a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to enhance maternal health care has been introduced in rural and
remote areas of the country. CommCare is an application that runs on cell phones distributed to community health
workers known as matrones who enroll and track women throughout pregnancy, birth and the post-partum, offering
health information, moral support, appointment reminders, and referrals to formal health care providers.
Methods: An ethnographic study of the CommCare intervention and the larger maternal health program into
which it fits was conducted in order to identify key social and cultural contextual factors that contribute to
the uptake and functioning of this mHealth intervention in Senegal. Ethnographic methods and semi-structured
interviews were used with participants drawn from four categories: NGO field staff (n = 16), trained health care
providers (including physicians, nurses, and midwives) (n = 19), community level health care providers (n = 13); and
women belonging to a community intervention known as the Care Group (n = 14). Data were analyzed using
interpretive analysis informed by critical medical anthropology theory.
Results: The study identified five socio-cultural factors that work in concert to encourage the uptake and use
of CommCare: convening women in the community Care Group; a cultural mechanism for enabling pregnancy
disclosure; constituting authoritative knowledge amongst women; harnessing the roles of older women; and adding
value to community health worker roles. We argue that, while CommCare is a powerful tool of information,
clinical support, surveillance, and data collection, it is also a social technology that connects and motivates
people, transforming relationships in ways that can optimize its potential to improve maternal health care.
Conclusions: In Senegal, mHealth has the potential not only to bridge the gaps of distance and expertise,
but to engage local people productively in the goal of enhancing maternal health care. Successful mHealth
interventions do not work as ‘magic bullets’ but are part of ‘assemblages’ – people and things that are
brought together to accomplish particular goals. Attention to the social and cultural elements of the global
health assemblage within which CommCare functions is critically important to understand and develop this
mHealth technology to its full potential.

Plain English summary
This paper reports on the results of a qualitative study
of an innovative mobile health (mHealth) intervention to
improve maternal health care in rural and remote areas
of Senegal. CommCare is an application that runs on cell
phones distributed to community level health workers
known as matrones. Women enrolled in the system are
tracked throughout pregnancy, delivery and the postpar-
tum including postnatal check-ups and infant vaccina-
tions. With the help of the device, matrones offer health
information, moral support, appointment reminders, and
can also make referrals directly to a Nurse or Midwife.

While mHealth technologies are emerging as part of
the solution to many pressing global health issues, little
is known about what makes them successful or not. Evi-
dence is particularly wanting in terms of how mhealth
interventions are understood and received at the local
level. Social science scholarship demonstrates that tech-
nology adoption and use is complex and often unpre-
dictable: context matters. In this study we sought to
explore the socio-cultural factors that contributed to the
uptake and functioning of CommCare and identified five
key interconnected socio-cultural elements including:
convening women in an intervention called the Care
Group, a cultural mechanism for enabling pregnancy
disclosure, constituting authoritative knowledge amongst
women, harnessing the roles of older women, and add-
ing value to the roles of community level actors. We
argue that CommCare, while a powerful tool of informa-
tion, surveillance, and data collection,
is also a social
technology that connects and motivates people and
transforms relationships in ways that optimize the po-
tential of the technology.

Background
Although considerable progress has been made in redu-
cing maternal mortality over the past 25 years in Senegal,
the national maternal mortality ratio (MMR) sits at 315
per 100,000 live births [1]. When the data are disaggre-
gated by both region and cause of death, an even more
challenging picture emerges. Government statistics from
2013 showed that while the MMR was 389 in urban
areas, it was 459 in rural areas overall, and as high as
700 in the most remote, underserviced areas of the
country [2, 3]. Direct obstetrical causes (hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy, haemorrhage, infection, unsafe
abortion and obstructed labour) account for the majority
of maternal deaths globally with the remaining due to
indirect causes such as malaria and anaemia [4, 5]. The
underlying causes of maternal morbidity and death in
Senegal are much the same as they are for other low re-
source countries in Africa: insufficient access to health
care during pregnancy and birth, lack of skilled health
personnel to provide quality antenatal and delivery care,

inefficient referral systems to care for women in obstet-
ric emergencies, and the diminished socio-economic sit-
uations of many families that leave women in poor
health. Many of these factors are exacerbated for women
living in rural areas far from health facilities [6, 7].

The reduction of maternal mortality is a priority of
Senegal’s Ministry of Health and Social Action (MOHSA)
and mobile health (mHealth) technologies are emerging as
part of the national approach [8]. Indeed, mHealth inter-
ventions such as rapid diagnostic tests, cell phone apps,
and telemedicine, are changing the reality of health care
delivery in low resource settings around the world [9]. Ex-
amples of mHealth interventions for maternal, neonatal
and infant health include mobile phones used to send
SMS reminders of antenatal care (ANC) appointments
and encourage patient adherence and follow up, provide
peer group support, support health workers in remote lo-
cations, provide health promotion information, facilitate
referrals, collect clinical data and deliver test results [10].
It is worth noting that mobile phone penetration in
Senegal, including rural areas, is high [11]; the vast major-
ity of people either own or have access to a mobile phone
and the wifi coverage is extensive. The majority of
mHealth interventions for maternal health in low resource
settings have been small-scale, donor-funded initiatives
[12]. While they meet the demand within global health ad-
vocacy and funding circles to be innovative, they are not
typically evidence based. Little is known about what makes
them successful or not in terms of implementation and
uptake. Evidence is particularly wanting in terms of how
mHealth interventions are understood and received at the
local level [13]. Social science scholarship demonstrates
that technology adoption and use is complex and often
unpredictable in any setting; context matters [14–16].
Therefore, research that can illuminate the context of
technologies introduced in the name of global health
ought to be part of the multi-disciplinary evidentiary mix.
In Senegal, mHealth has the potential not only to
bridge the gaps of distance and expertise, but to engage
local people productively in the project of improving
maternal health. In rural and remote areas of the coun-
try, people rely mostly on health posts for primary care;
health centres and hospitals with resident physicians are
few and far between. Health posts are staffed by state-
trained and employed nurses -- often men -- known as
Infermièr(e)s Chef de Poste (ICP) and by midwives (Sage-
femmes) -- usually women. They are assisted in their
task of delivering primary health care to their vast con-
stituencies by a cadre of community health workers, in-
cluding Agents de
(ASC)
(community health workers) who offer limited primary
care in community based structures know as Cases de
Santé (health huts), and matrones, (community level
birth attendants). Both types of community level health

workers, while acknowledged by the state as essential,
are volunteers trained and supported largely by non-gov-
ernmental organisations.

Africare is a non-governmental organisation whose
mission since its founding in the 1970s has been “Im-
proving Lives and Building Futures” across Africa
(https://www.africare.org/country/senegal/).
In Senegal,
Africare delivers programs in economic development,
community health, and food security that support state
infrastructures and policies particularly in rural and
remote areas. Africare’s overall goal in the realm of ma-
ternal health has been to increase demand for quality
health services, support locally driven behaviour change,
and bolster the functioning of the state health system
and its trained personnel by training and supporting
community level health workers.

In 2014 Africare launched CommCare, an mHealth
application that runs on cell phones distributed to
matrones (or in some cases community health workers).
It features health information and a service platform
using text, pictures and voice in four languages, depend-
ing on the region. Building upon the community level
interventions put in place during two USAID funded
community health projects (Projet Santé Communau-
taire I (PSCI, 2008–2012) and II (2012–2016), Comm-
Care is part of a project called Collaborative Technologie
à base communautaire pour ameliorer la Santé Mater-
nelle et
(Collaborative
Community-based Technology to Improve Maternal and
Child Health in Senegal) funded by Grand Challenges
Canada in their Saving Lives at Birth (SLAB) stream.
The basic application was created by Dimagi – a mobile
health technology company – and tailored for use by
Africare for the communities in which they work. Afri-
care collaborated on the design of the CommCare plat-
form with intensive input from community level and
skilled health personnel.

(CCHT)

The way that CommCare works is that matrones regis-
ter pregnant women on the application, inputting all the
pertinent health and contact information about the pa-
tient. The matrone follows the woman throughout her
pregnancy, reminding her about the four recommended
antenatal consultations, accompanying her in person to
appointments, and supporting her in following medical
advice, including tests, prescriptions and making a birth
plan. CommCare also has an education and information
component; the matrone is directed by the device to im-
part information about proper rest and nutrition during
pregnancy and to inquire about danger signs and symp-
toms that might be cause for referral to the health post
– such as swollen hands and feet or vaginal bleeding.
The digital
file for each woman generated by the
matrone is automatically shared with the nurse or mid-
wife at the local health post or health centre who also

has a mobile phone with the application installed. A key
feature of CommCare is the ability for matrones to make
electronic referrals through the device directly to a nurse
or midwife. In addition, CommCare inputs are uploaded
in real time to the dashboard for monitoring and data
collection at the district level.

Recent data generated by Africare demonstrates posi-
tive trends in terms of measurable increases in ANC at-
tendance, deliveries with qualified personnel, and PNC
attendance [17]. This study was conducted to learn more
about why and how these improvements are working, fo-
cusing on the interconnectedness of the technology and
its social and cultural context.

Methods
This ethnographic study of Africare’s CommCare inter-
vention and its larger maternal health program was con-
ducted between January and June 2016 with follow up
visits in May–June 2017 and May 2018. Ziguinchor we
focussed on three regions: Tambacounda, Ziguinchor
and Sedhiou. The first author, a medical anthropologist
with training and extensive experience in qualitative
methods, conducted the interviews and ethnographic ob-
servation while the second author contributed to study
design and analysis. The qualitative methodology was
intended to produce knowledge that would complement
and augment data Africare collects routinely as part of
its monitoring and evaluation practices. Ethnographic
methods and semi-structured, open-ended interviews
were used to look closely at what is often described in
anthropological terms as ‘the particularities’ and ‘the
pragmatics’ of CommCare on the ground. The interview
schedule for each category of participant was designed
to elicit information, experiences and personal reflec-
tions concerning the design and functioning of
the
CommCare intervention in the community. Field notes
were also taken throughout. Evidence in ethnographic
research is not confined to data generated by interviews
but also includes the observations of the researcher in
the field. For example, the researchers learned about
Care Groups and the power dynamics within them not
only from having them described in formal interviews,
but by attending them. The total number of field visits
and interviews ensured that data saturation – under-
stood as a process, rather than a single point [18] – was
achieved, ensuring the quality and reliability of the data.
Triangulation is an inherent feature of ethnographic re-
search in that data are drawn from a range of sources
and by a range of methods – interviews, focus groups,
field description, and documents – thereby increasing
the validity of the research results [19, 20]. Recognition
of the value of ethnographic methods in global health re-
search has grown over the past decade [21–24]. While

produced by ethnographic methods can provide insights
that can contribute to national and global level health
policy and practice.

A total of 62 interviews were conducted with partici-
pants drawn from four categories: Africare executive,
technical and field staff coded as NGO (n = 16); state
trained health care providers
including physicians,
nurses, and midwives coded as HCP (n = 19); community
level health care providers including matrones and com-
munity health workers coded as MAT (n = 14); and
women belonging to a community intervention known
as the Care Group coded as CG (n = 13). The number of
participants in Care Group interviews varied depending
on the community, with the smallest being 6 and the lar-
gest more than 25. Interviews and Care Group group
meetings took place with aid of translators and were oc-
casionally attended in full or in part by other members
of the community, such as representatives of the com-
munity health committee. Individual meetings with Afri-
care staff and state trained formal health care providers
took place in French with the first author alone. Inter-
views were typically conducted over the course of a sin-
gle day field visit to each community in order to capture
as many of the desired participants as possible from the
target categories. The range in the number of partici-
pants from Care Group to Care Group was due to differ-
ing populations in communities and the availability of
individuals on a given day. Interviews were recorded
with permission of the participants and translated and
transcribed into French.

The purpose of the study was to observe and describe
the logic and structures of Africare’s maternal health in-
terventions
in Senegal, hear directly from Africare
personnel who implement the programs in the field, talk
to health professionals who deliver clinical and public
health services that intersect with Africare programs and
to hear from members of communities who are the tar-
gets of interventions about their motivations and experi-
ences. Data analysis involved careful reading and coding
of the transcripts and field notes in order ensure familiar-
ity with the data. Codes were developed in relation to the
broad objectives of the research and refined inductively in
the initial reading of the data by the first author while ap-
plying interpretive anthropological analysis [25–27] in-
formed by critical medical anthropology theory [28, 29].
For example, the initial code “Care Group” was refined
into several sub-codes including “early pregnancy disclos-
ure within Care Group” because the analysis of infor-
mants’ statements and field observations indicated the
critical importance of the Care Group in facilitating early
pregnancy disclosure. Saturation was achieved as broad
themes emerged from the coding process followed by dee-
per nuance and insights related to those codes. Prelimin-
ary analysis was validated in meetings between the first

and second author. Ethnography as a method provides op-
portunities for informal participant feedback throughout
the research which contributes to the validation of prelim-
inary findings and alerts the researcher to unexplored
themes. Preliminary findings were also presented and vali-
dated at a series of participant feedback meetings in the
health districts of Tambacounda and Ziguinchor and with
Africare personnel in Dakar, a process intended to in-
crease the “trustworthiness” and applicability of the re-
search findings [30]. Five key elements were identified that
together shape the use of CommCare in the context of
Africare’s maternal health work in Senegal.

Results
The main finding of this study is that successful inter-
ventions do not work as ‘magic bullets’ – even if a novel
and powerful technology is deployed -- but rather func-
tion within assemblages. By assemblage we mean a set of
elements, ideas, and actors that are brought together de-
liberately or spontaneously to accomplish a particular
goal [31, 32]. While one aspect of an assembled global
health intervention may be the most visible – as is the
case with CommCare -- attention to how all the ele-
ments work together is critically important to under-
stand and develop the intervention to its full potential.
The key features of the CommCare assemblage include:
convening women, enabling pregnancy disclosure, con-
stituting authoritative knowledge, harnessing the roles of
older women, and adding value to community level
health workers. Access to electricity, phone credit, and
the wifi network in rural areas where the project runs is
also essential and Africare is working on its own innova-
tive solutions in those area -- including partnerships
with telecom companies and providing solar energy
charging stations to health posts -- but in this research
we focus on the social and cultural elements of the as-
semblage which tend to be under studied in global
health research. Describing these elements in turn will
illuminate our central argument that CommCare, while
a powerful tool of information, clinical support, surveil-
lance and data collection, is also a social technology that
connects and motivates people and transforms relation-
ships

Convening women: the Care Group

Everything we do in maternal health here is carried by
the Care Group. It is the Care Group that allows us to
move things forward (NGO 8)

A main vehicle through which Africare delivers its
work to improve maternal health in Senegal is known as
the Care Group. Care Groups consist of up to 25 women

MacDonald and Diallo Reproductive Health          (2019) 16:141 

Page 5 of 12

in a community who meet weekly and subscribe to the
group with a small fee given each week into a communal
pot. The Care Group draws on the tradition of women’s
associations in Senegalese society and has therefore been
well received. Care Group membership is voluntary and
the percentage of women from each community who be-
long to a Care Group is variable. But when one Care
Group begins to function well in a community, others
have formed spontaneously and have reached out to
Africare field staff for training and support. The purpose
of the Care Group is twofold. First,
it functions as a
place where women receive information about the bene-
fits of skilled care during pregnancy, birth and the post-
partum period, and are encouraged to seek out prenatal
care, make a birth plan, and deliver at a health facility
with a skilled attendant posted by the MOHSA -- either
a nurse with midwifery skills or a midwife. Second, the
Care Group has a savings and lending function so that
women can afford both the routine and unexpected
costs of antenatal care and birth – medications, diagnos-
tic tests, and transport -- a reality in the context of a
health system that charges user fees.

We contribute money to the Care Group every
Saturday, and it is also the occasion when we discuss
our health problems. Whenever a woman has a health
problem she can count on the group to give her enough
money for her care and then she can pay it back. (CG
2, 2016)

I think that since the setting up of the Care Group
women come earlier for their prenatal consultations
and then follow them. Children are vaccinated, women
are better informed, and women receive support and
guidance from marraines (godmothers) (CG 1, 2016)

Care groups are accepted in the communities. Village
chiefs, to whom we made courtesy visits as a matter of
protocol before beginning our research for the day, were
generally positive towards the intervention because they
supported the goal of improving women’s health and
noted the practical value of women saving money col-
lectively for health care.

Nurses and Midwives posted to rural areas also ob-

serve the value of the Care Groups.

The Care Group is an organization that aims to unite
women for better management of their health. Since
their installation, we have seen results. Honestly
speaking, there have been results because I always say
that it is not because they do not want to go to the
hospital but because they do not know the dangers
that lie ahead. So with the Care Group this allowed

them to accentuate -- to multiply the talks, to multiply
the home visits. At least every month they have four
meetings. So every week, a meeting. And with their
means of contribution that they make, the 50 Francs
subscription, the money is there. So there is no “my
husband has no money” problem. So that solved that
problem. (HCP 19)

The Care Group provides the social platform and
enabling structure for other things to happen that
are key to the success of the CommCare interven-
tion. Several
features of the Care Group, discussed
below,
facilitate the uptake and optimal use of
CommCare because of the way they incorporate cul-
tural norms.

Enabling pregnancy disclosure
For CommCare to work, women must disclose their
pregnancies and be registered. This simple truth illus-
trates the central role of the Care Group in encouraging
women to disclose their pregnancies early and start
antenatal care in a timely manner. Cultural norms in
rural Senegal have women keeping their pregnancy sta-
tus private for as long as possible. Women are con-
cerned that a pregnancy disclosed too early is at risk of
attracting mauvais esprits (bad spirits) and negative at-
tention from others, which they identify as risks to
themselves and their fetus. They prefer to wait until they
begin to physically show – often well into the second tri-
mester – which runs counter to best practices for ante-
natal care to begin in the first trimester and complete
four antenatal consultations. Delaying disclosure pre-
sents a paradox for women who, as they become in-
the benefits of prenatal care through
formed about
Africare’s education and information activities,
find
themselves in the difficult position of having to weigh
the risks they perceive in early disclosure against the ob-
stetrical risks of delayed antenatal care.

The power of the Care Group is that it works with,
not against, the desire of women to keep their pregnan-
cies private from the wider community well into the sec-
ond trimester. During the Care Group meeting, a
woman can signal discreetly to the others in the group
that she is pregnant, often without even saying so aloud.
Interviews with Africare technical and field staff alerted
us to the practice which was confirmed during multiple
field observations of Care Group meetings and Care
Group interviews.

Within the Care Group, women have a code. If
someone falls pregnant, she wears a single earring and
everyone knows that she is expecting. One doesn’t have
to say anything. It’s the code of the group and no-one
but the groups is aware. (NGO 8, 2016)

MacDonald and Diallo Reproductive Health          (2019) 16:141 

Page 6 of 12

Before the formation of the Care Group, to identify a
pregnant woman was a real problem. A woman would
hide her pregnancy. But when we put in place the
Care Group, in effect, we put in place a method for
detecting pregnancy. So, when you come to a meeting,
there is a secret code that says, see, this woman is
pregnant. And like that, the Care Group members will
know (CG 11 2017).

The pregnant woman is then matched with a marraine
from the group who becomes her guide and support per-
son throughout her pregnancy, accompanying her to the
community level health birth attendant – the matrone –
as well as to antenatal consultations with the midwife or
nurse at the health post. This creative use of the Care
Group allows women to both comfortably disclose their
pregnancies to the small group and discreetly begin preg-
nancy care, while at the same time keeping it secret from
the larger community until a later date. This mechanism
for enabling early pregnancy disclosure within the Care
Group facilitates CommCare registration which, in turn,
supports the course of clinical care.

Before, the midwife had a hard time identifying
women who needed prenatal care. But with
registration in CommCare, each time a woman falls
pregnant the Care Group directs her to go for her ANC
visits. And when she is registered, it makes following
her care a lot easier and they get better care. Truly,
this CommCare has improved the situation of
pregnant women and also their health during their
reproductive years generally (CG 7, 2017)

Harnessing the authority of older women
Another way that the Care Group works with cultural
norms, is by harnessing the power of older women, ra-
ther than seeing them largely as the perpetuators of
traditional knowledge and practices. Older
harmful
women in Senegalese
and
mothers in law) are sometimes the source of strain for
pregnant women trying to navigate the new information
and behaviour change expected of them in global health
projects. As elders, they also tend to have more personal
authority vis a vis younger men and women, especially
their sons and daughters in law. “The husband has
power, but mothers in law do too!” » (HCP 7, 2016).

(grandmothers

society

In another subtle manoeuvre, the Care Group ac-
knowledges the authority of older women and includes
and transforms the traditional roles of older women in
(belle-meres) become
the community: grandmothers,
marraines, and some former traditional birth attendants
become matrones, rather than making them redundant
and setting them up as “barriers” to progress around

which daughters and daughters in law are expected to
awkwardly (and impossibly) sidestep.

In the Care Group we have women of reproductive
age, pregnant women, breastfeeding women and we
have grandmothers and this is a layer that should not
be overlooked because they are the ones who often
make the decisions about maternal health and having
them in the Care Group also allows us to educate
them. (NGO 7, 2016).

In one Care Group interview, I asked a young mother to
describe her recent experience with maternity care and
childbirth. She told a brief story about her healthy preg-
nancy and delivery at the health post in which we were
assembled. When the new mother fell quiet, the mid-
wife, who had ambled over to join the meeting, cut in:

There is the mother in law right there! She is the one
who belongs to the Care Group. The daughter in law is
new to the village and this is her first child. It was the
mother in law sitting right there who went to her
house and asked her: Are you following your antenatal
appointments? No. She had done one and two but not
three and four. So the mother in law brought the
matrone to make the appointment and they went to
the health post (CG 13, 2018)

The other women in the group were nodding in agree-

ment. The midwife went on:

This lady, she is my friend in this work. Truly. Because
she is really engaged. She is available. She
accompanies the younger women. She is like the
mother in law to all the women in this village. The
others too (looking around) but at almost every
delivery, she is there. (CG 13, 2018)

Understanding and working with cultural norms around
gendered and age related authority facilitates and
strengthens the entire maternal health assemblage: it fa-
cilitates the uptake of health education and information
and encourages early disclosure, which facilitates early
enrolment
the viability of
CommCare depends upon these elements.

in CommCare.

Indeed,

Constituting authoritative knowledge
When the Care Group is functioning well and is ac-
cepted by the larger community, it becomes a source of
“authoritative knowledge” - a social science concept that
is defined as “knowledge that gets to count” [33, 34]. Au-
thoritative knowledge is knowledge upon which vital de-
cisions can be made, such as the dispensing of money to
buy medication for a pregnant woman, or the decision

MacDonald and Diallo Reproductive Health          (2019) 16:141 

Page 7 of 12

to transport her to a facility to give birth. Respect for the
Care Group’s authority by the community as a whole
marks a shift in the decision-making power in the com-
munity regarding pregnancy and birth towards women
as a group. This aspect of the Care Group works with
the reality that reproduction is not a solo endeavour in
Senegal. (Nor is reproduction a solo endeavour in the
West, but this characterization of women’s embedded-
ness in the power of family tends to be exaggerated for
women in the global south). Senegalese women do not
always have a great deal of individual decision making
power, but rather they belong to families and communi-
ties in which husbands and belle-meres have a great deal
of say over them. The Care Group generates collective
power and authority,
than asking individual
women to stand up against community norms, expecta-
tions or constraints. The collective authority of the Care
Group does not preclude the expression of individual
‘rights’ or empowerment – concepts at the centre of glo-
bal health ‘reproductive and sexual health and rights’
frameworks -- but it does not demand it. It does not as-
sume that women’s empowerment must be individual-
ized to be real or to be effective in reaching the end
goal: maternal survival and health. The Care Group al-
lows women to develop social and financial solidarity.

rather

In the communities where we work, even if men
appear to have the decision making power, women are
the foundation … Care Groups educate and support
not only women. I have seen Care Groups in which
men are involved. I have attended community
meetings in which men stand up and say that it is
because of the Care Group that they now understand
so much more about childbirth, and who credit care
groups with helping not just pregnant women but the
entire community (NGO 9, 2016)

The testimony of the head of the community health
committee who was present at a CG meeting bears this
out.

This project has allowed our mothers, our women and
the ICP and his team to work well together. And as
much as there have been difficulties in the past --
before this intervention many women hid their
pregnancies -- today, as we speak this no longer
happens, because in these women's groups, they help
each other to push the woman who is able to go to the
post to try to eliminate the complications in the
pregnancies. Because if you do not go for prenatal
visits there are many complications that can happen. I
first learned about all this from my brother who
started talking about it. At times I did not understand
what the Care Group was. I would hear about it and I

looked at it like one would a TV [from the outside].
But after these explanations I found it extremely
important (CG 12, 2018).

Reflecting on the subtle changes seen over time with
regard to women’s empowerment in the communities in
which they work, this respondent from Africare said

What does the app bring in terms of the confidence of
women in themselves, the power unleashed to women?
You see, that is quite interesting. Because when I look
at, when I visit [the region of] Maka, today, when I
compare it to my first visit, I see that this is really
something that has been brought out in women. They
are more confident. They are more organized and
engaged (NGO 11, 2018)

Overall we contend that the authority of the Care
Group subtly shifts power away from the sources of au-
thority that hamper maternal health -- whether it is con-
trolling treatment by belle-meres, the withholding of
funds and decision making power by fathers and hus-
bands, or misinformation that circulates in the commu-
nity – to women as a group. Understanding the power
of the Care Group in terms of its ability to build social
and financial solidarity,
to work with local cultural
norms, to increase women’s confidence in managing
their reproductive health affairs, and thereby to generate
respect and authoritative knowledge is key to under-
standing CommCare as a social technology. Understand-
ing and supporting these features optimizes its potential.

Adding value to community health workers
CommCare was designed to be used by matrones –
community level health care providers responsible for
maternal and newborn health. Although skilled attend-
ance in a functioning health facility remains a key goal
of the global maternal health policy of the MOHSA in
Senegal to improve maternal survival, the fact remains
that many women – more than 50% in some regions of
Senegal – continue to give birth in their communities
[3]. Africare has been training and supporting matrones
as a core feature of their maternal health programming
for many years before the start of the CommCare pro-
ject. The value of training of traditional birth attendants
to contribute to maternal health has a been a matter of
significant scientific debate. Training programs have
been criticised for their brevity, poor quality, lack of fol-
low-up, failure to account for cultural context, and lack
of integration with the formal health care system [35–
39]. Training programs for matrones in Senegal seek to
avoid some of these pitfalls. Matrones train for up to 1
year (depending on previous experience) in an empirical,
apprenticeship style with midwives and nurses, often

living in Health Centres and Posts for the duration. In
one of the first field visits during the research we were
invited into the living quarters of the resident midwives,
adjacent to the busy health post in which they worked.
The midwives explained that the matrones had lodged
with them for the duration of their training becoming
close and growing to understand and respect each other,
despite differences of socio economic background, edu-
cation and language (Field Notes Feb 17, 2016). In these
ways, matrones become strongly linked to the formal
health care system; they are not outsiders. Furthermore,
matrones reduce and ease the work burdens of nurses

they appreciate:

in ways

This matrone reflects on her work, noting both chal-

lenges and positive changes:

With the training, one must practice, one must make
an effort. But there have been many changes. There
are women who miss their appointments. Sometimes
the network isn’t working. But you have the example of
the young woman sitting right there. She fell pregnant
and we talked to her, we talked to her mother and she
attended all four prenatal consultations and she gave
birth under good conditions and has also followed the
vaccinations (MAT 2, 2017)

Health care providers in rural Senegal offered testi-
relying on
monies on the practical necessity of
matrones in rural areas. They praised their training
and abilities with regard to identifying the signs of
danger, making referrals correctly and even adminis-
trating some medications, such as misoprostol, at the
community level, noting how CommCare had aided
matrones’ abilities and motivation. « They are often
at my side during births and they help with getting
women to follow their prenatal and post natal ap-
pointments » (HCP 6, 2016).

One ICP recounted the following story when asked

about how he viewed the work of matrones:

When I was posted in [another town], there was a
referral that went very well. The matrone sent me a
message about a woman who was about to give birth
with a posterior breech presentation. The message
reached me just when I arrived in Bignona and when I
saw it I came to the health post immediately and I
met the ambulance and we sent the mother to
Ziguinchor. [What’s important about the story] is that
the referral was done properly, on time, and the

matrone used the mobile to inform me. Otherwise it
would have been a catastrophe (HCP 11, 2017)

Another ICP with more than 20 years of experience, in-
cluding many years at the most remote health post in
the country, acknowledged that he could not do his
work without matrones “I have confidence in them”
(HCP 16, 2018) he stated. One challenge with the task
shifting to matrones is that they continue to be engaged
as volunteers who are trained and logistically supported,
but not paid for their work. Most matrones are diligent
and competent but we knew of several matrones who
had lost their mobile phones or ‘given up’ their involve-
ment in the CCHT project because of the need to work
at other things.

status;

skills and social

CommCare adds value to the role of matrone in terms
of her
the
matrone’s social and affective ties to the women in her
care; and it strengthens the matrone’s professional ties
to nurses and midwives and increases the respect to
which they are accorded. It is not the case that every
matrone excels or every relationship is always positive,
but what the observations in this study signal is the im-
portance of the relationships of confidence and rapport.
In these ways CommCare both relies on social relation-
ships to function and contributes positively to the kinds
of sociality and care that make good health care systems.
As western biomedical systems are now realizing, the
caring gap filled by auxiliary health workers is not a
superficial extra, but an essential element of high quality
care that contributes to good clinical outcomes. Recent
scholarship identifies the crucial role of good client-pro-
vider communication and quality of care in both low
and high resource settings [40–42].

This final quote below speaks to the positive attitude
towards the value and capabilities of matrones, amongst
skilled health care providers who work in rural and re-
mote areas and a shift in perspective towards to seeing
the task of
improving maternity care increasingly in
terms of public health education and community en-
gagement, of which matrones are an important part.

If the matrone is trained, she can do it. They give them
the criteria: this woman you can care for; this woman
you must refer. There is a chart on the wall of the
Case and the device reminds them. And they do it
correctly. It is community health, you see? It is a
necessary evolution in a region such as this where
access to a Health Post could be many kilometers
away (HCP 17, 2018)

The matrone is recognized by the Ministry of Health
and Social Action in Senegal as having a role to play at
the community level and as an adjunct to the clinical

care of a skilled clinician; they are publically valorized

Worker [43, 44].

Discussion
The idea of technology as social is well developed in
medical anthropology and Science and Technology
Studies
rarely have mainstream global
health scholars engaged with this literature in order
to understand how mHealth technology works (or
not) on the ground. An excellent example of an STS
approach to mHealth technology in a global health
setting is a study by anthropologist Eileen Moyer on
the use of cell phones to send peer to peer SMS mes-
sages to improve Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) adher-
ence amongst HIV positive individuals
in a poor
neighbourhood in Nairobi, Kenya [45]. In her study,
the peer mentors’
Moyer notes several aspects of
work that mirrors our observations here
about
matrones. Peer mentors use the technology to fulfill a
she observes, but also to care
logistical
about patients; these dual roles increase patient par-
ticipation in treatment programs and the commitment
of the peer to peer counselors. In contrast
to our
findings, however, Moyer notes
that often formal
health care workers do not know about or value the
peer mentors’ technology-facilitated care and that this
is, a weakness of the ART mHealth project. Thinking
about technology as social is a novel approach in glo-
bal health research and it can reveal
important but
hard to see aspects of how global health technologies
work and the ways in which they can be supported.

power in the management of their own maternal health:
the influence of mothers and mothers-in-law. These em-
pirical observations counter dichotomous models of gen-
der
literature.
Recognizing and working with the powerful influence of
older women in families and communities means that
interventions to improve the use of ANC and increase
the number of births with skilled attendants should not
only target women of childbearing age and their hus-
bands, but also, where relevant, older women [47, 48].

Finally, these findings are relevant to long standing in-
ter-disciplinary debates on the role of traditional birth at-
in global maternal health [49–52]. Recent
tendants
scholarship has re-ignited the question of whether and
how TBAs can play a role in reducing maternal mortality,
arguing that given the practical necessity of community
level birth attendance in many places, their potential
should be properly evaluated and their participation tai-
lored to the particularities of the local context, so that
trained community level maternity care workers can be
part of the solution instead of part of the problem [53, 54].
This observation finds support within global level policy
and research on local interventions for task shifting and
task sharing defined as.

“the rational redistribution of tasks among health
workforce teams [in which] specific tasks are moved,
where appropriate, from highly qualified health
workers to health workers with shorter training and
fewer qualifications in order to make more efficient
use of the available human resources for health” [55].

Another relevent social science notion for understand-
ing the social context of
technology is authoritative
knowledge. A central concept in a branch of medical an-
thropology known as the anthropology of reproduction,
authoritative knowledge was first developed as a way to
understand heirarchies in knowledge about birth and
why some knowledge is privileged over other knowledge
and becomes the basis on which critical decisions about
care are made [33, 34, 46]. Using this idea, we identified
subtle shifts in collective power and authority of Sene-
galese women who belong to Care Groups, vis-à-vis
community norms and gender dynamics. The notion of
authoritative knowledge reminds us that authority is not
distributed in a dichotomous way beween men (who
have power) and women (who do not) but is more subtle
and mutable. Women’s authority in the global south
need not look exactly like it does in the global north for
us to acknowledge and work with it to further the ends
of reducing maternal deaths.

Relatedly, the findings of this study contribute to an
under-researched area within an otherwise extensive lit-
erature exploring women’s unequal decision-making

In addition, the emergence of a range of technical and
pharmaceutical interventions proposed for use by TBA-
like community actors (in some cases appropriately
described as auxiliary midwives) is a major factor in revi-
siting and re-thinking the policies that have sidelined
them. New clinical research is emerging to show that
matrones in Senegal, for example, are capable of cor-
rectly managing PPH with misoprostol [56–58]. Such
studies can trickle up to the national and global policy
level [59].

Taken together, our findings signal a shift in how to
think about and navigate the social and cultural context
of mHealth interventions in global health settings. First,
understand the particulars of a given setting rather than
rely on broad generalisations about ‘other cultures’. Sec-
ond, work with social and cultural norms rather than
conceiving of them as barriers to knock down or over-
come. Third, consider qualitative methodologies to illu-
minate the subtle aspects of the interconnectedness of
technology and people.

There are a number of limitations of the study. First,
participants were recruited because they were already

MacDonald and Diallo Reproductive Health          (2019) 16:141 

Page 10 of 12

involved in Africare’s community health activities and,
therefore, may have been less likely to share highly crit-
ical opinions or experiences. Second, focus group inter-
views can privilege some voices over others. Yet this
very limitation yielded insight into an important dy-
namic – the powerful role that older women play in the
lives of their sons, daughters, and daughters in law. To
mitigate against this, three small focus groups were con-
ducted for young married women only. (All were older
than 18). A final limitation of the study is that, given the
need for translators to conduct some interviews or por-
tions of interviews, some nuance may have been lost in
the moment, though we did have the benefit of reading
the transcripts later.

interventions. The authors of the Lancet Commission on
Technologies for Global Health 2012 wrote: «Technol-
ogy should be combined with other innovations, such as
effective delivery mechanisms and novel approaches to
financing if it is to be scaled-up and have a substantial
effect on global health » [60]. Our findings accord with
this observation and seek to add to it by naming and
elaborating the range of novel and sometimes hard to
see ‘innovations’ at the community level. Ethnographic
and other modes of qualitative research that can illumin-
ate the social and cultural context of technologies intro-
duced in the name of global health ought to be part of
the multi-disciplinary contributions to global health re-
search and implementation.

Conclusion
CommCare is an mHealth innovation that has captured
the imagination of local people and engaged a range of
actors in the project of improving maternal and infant
health in Senegal. It may seem an obvious point to make
that technology is not autonomous, that it is, quite liter-
ally, in the hands of users who are part of communities
and cultures. Although CommCare is the most visible,
most attention grabbing feature of Africare’s efforts to
improve maternal health in Senegal, it is a social tech-
nology, one part of an assemblage that is grounded by
the Care Group and relies on the work of matrones and
the skills and social relationships they develop in their
communities and with formal health care providers.
CommCare -- while a powerful tool of information, de-
cision making support, recording keeping, accompani-
ment, and data collection – also connects and motivates
people and transform relationships.

There was a diversity of vantage points across re-
spondent groups. Though some midwives, nurses and
Africare staff who worked closely with communities
expressed frustration from time to time about matrones
who lost cell phones or failed to learn how to use them
quickly, and though some matrones and Care Groups
complained they needed more support, all were in broad
agreement about the value and potential of the Comm-
Care intervention. There was also broad agreement
across respondent groups about the socio-cultural fac-
tors that inhibited women’s uptake of ANC and assisted
deliveries and therefore an appreciation of the ways that
CommCare was socially embedded within the workings
of the Care Group and matrone in a hands-on way.

The Ministry of Health and Social Action in Senegal
(MOHSA) intends to roll out CommCare across the
country and also add to its functionality with other fea-
tures. Keeping the CommCare assemblage as we have
described in this paper firmly in view may facilitate this
scale up. But the findings from this study are not limited
