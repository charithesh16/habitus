elastic sowing dates (eSDs) are correlated with rice grain yield. eSD is the easiest factor for farmers 
to manipulate in mechanized large-scale farming. In this study, field experiments were conducted 
over a 2-year period to determine the effects of different sowing dates on growth duration, effective 
accumulated temperature, and yield attributes in two early- and late-season machine-transplanted 
rice cultivars. in early rice (eR), a delay in the sowing date led to decreased grain yield and shorter 
growth duration. In late rice (LR), delayed sowing led to significantly lower grain yield and prolonged 
growth duration. In LR, significantly positive correlations were detected between effective accumulated 
temperature in the post-heading stage and both filling ratio and yield. Reproductive redundancy 
increased markedly in LR, by 7.72% over a 5-day interval. We determined that the ESDs for LR were 
10 days later than the control, and that of ER was recommend early sowing rather than late sowing. 
These findings suggest a new strategy to meet the demands of mechanized large-scale rice farming: the 
development of thermal sensitive high-yield long-duration eR cultivars and high-yield short-duration 
LR cultivars.

Double rice cropping is a typical rice production system in China, accounting for >20% of the total rice pro-
duction area, and is considered an efficient system for the improvement of multiple-crop indices and total rice 
production1. Yang et al.2 reported that rice production in China increased by 4.0% with the concomitant favorable 
adoption of a multiple-cropping system. Therefore, rice production plays a pivotal role in ensuring national food 
security3. Machine transplanting is a labor-saving alternative rice cultivation technology4. As efficient agriculture 
and land transfer systems have been popularized in recent years, mechanized large-scale farming technology has 
developed rapidly for rice production in China5,6, leading to increases in the time required for farming operations 
(e.g., land preparation and seedling transplantation)7; therefore, reasonable seedling transplantation practices in 
terms of sowing date and seedling age are needed. Important non-monetary factors affecting potential rice yield 
include transplanting time (sowing date if seedling age is constant) and seedling age at transplanting8. Sowing 
date is correlated to rice grain yield, and is the easiest factor for producers to manipulate9,10. However, little infor-
mation is available on the role of elastic sowing dates (ESDs) in mechanized large-scale farming because seedling 
age is generally limited to 20 days for early rice (ER) and 15 days for late rice (LR).

Under small-scale manual transplanting practices, ESDs are March 25–30 for ER and June 25–28 for LR in 
China. Due to increases in the length of farming operations in mechanized large-scale farming systems, delayed 
sowing dates have been adopted by most farmers; however, delayed sowing reduces the effectiveness of accumu-
lated temperature due to decreasing daily temperatures in LR fields6, resulting in poor rice growth and develop-
ment, and ultimately grain yield loss. Furthermore, ESDs for ER necessarily affect those for LR. Therefore, ESDs 
for ER and LR should be improved. In this study, we investigated ESDs for ER and LR to maintain yield in mech-
anized large-scale farming systems. We conducted field experiments over a 2-year study period to determine the 
effects of ESDs on growth duration, effective accumulated temperature, and yield attributes of ER and LR cultivars 
under machine-transplanted conditions.

Results
Growth duration vary with different sowing dates.  Growth duration was shorter for ER with 
delayed sowing (Table 1). A 15-day delay in sowing led to a 3-day reduction in growth duration compared 
with the control. In LR, growth duration was prolonged as sowing date was delayed; the growth duration 
following a 20-day delay in sowing was more than 8 days longer than that of the control, especially in the 
reproductive stage. Total effective accumulated temperature exhibited the opposite trend. Growth duration 
decreased and significantly increased as effective accumulated temperature increased in ER and LR, respec-
tively (Table 2). Effective accumulated temperature decreased by an average of 52.2 °C in LR, with a 5-day 
interval.

Reproductive redundancy and nutrition redundancy under different sowing dates.  No sig-
nificant difference in aboveground biomass was observed in ER or LR among different sowing dates (Table 3); 
aboveground biomass was 1467–1526 g m−2 in LR. Variation in crop growth rate (CGR) exhibited a similar trend. 
Harvest index (HI) declined in both ER and LR as sowing date was postponed (Table 3), and decreased dramati-
cally in LR, by 3.8% with a 5-day interval. Reproductive redundancy increased by 2.68 and 7.72% in ER and LR,

respectively, with a 5-day interval, following sowing date delay (Fig. 1b). Nutrition redundancy increased by 2.72 
and 1.57% in ER and LR, respectively, with a 5-day interval following sowing date delay (Fig. 1a).

Yield difference under different sowing dates.  Grain yield in ER and LR decreased as sowing date 
delay increased (Table 4). In LR, grain yields differed significantly among different sowing dates (P < 0.05). Grain 
yield was 6.82–7.36 t/ha in ER and 7.40–7.98 t/ha in LR with a sowing date delay of 0–10 days. In LR, filling rate 
decreased significantly (by 8.85%, with a 5-day interval) as sowing date delay increased. We detected significant 
positive correlations between effective accumulated temperature in the post-heading stage and yield (P < 0.01) 
and filling ratio (P < 0.01) in LR (Table 5). No significant differences were observed in panicles m−2, spikelet 
panicle−1, or grain weight among treatments in ER or LR. Therefore, sufficient effective accumulated temperature 
(low daily temperature occurred at anthesis with delay ESD, Fig. 1a,b) at anthesis was the key to determining ESD 
in LR to maintain high grain yield.

Discussions
ensuring elastic sowing date in mechanized large-scale double-cropped rice production.  The 
ER and LR cultivars used in this study are temperature- and light-sensitive, respectively. In a study of two field 
stations in China during 1981–2000, Tao et al.11 reported that growth duration was significantly shorter and 
longer in ER and LR, respectively, as temperature increased. Our data also indicated indirectly that ER growth 
duration decreased as effective accumulated temperatures increased. In contrast, Zhang et al.12 demonstrated that 
planting short-duration cultivars at increasing temperatures exacerbated undesired phenological changes, with 
the growth duration of the late rice cultivar ‘HY518’ 7–14 days shorter than that of ‘TY390’. In the current study, 
the reproductive stage of rice sown after a 20-day delay was dramatically prolonged, to 8 days longer than that of 
the control. Therefore, priority should be given to the ESD of late rice; in long-duration cultivars, reasonable ESD 
should be set at no later than July 10, especially as the ESD of ER is dependent on that of LR.

Annual rice grain yield maintenance was dependent on late rice grain yield. 
In late rice (LR), 
delayed sowing led to significantly lower grain yield and prolonged growth duration. Similar results have been 
reported previously, with delayed transplanting reducing spikelet filling and grain yield due to low temperature

stress at anthesis in machine-transplanted LR7. The number of days with daily mean temperature <22 °C, which 
is the critical low temperature for anthesis in rice13, increased as sowing date was postponed, at 2–10 days in 2015 
and 0–7 days in 2016 during the first 10 days after heading. These variation were directly affect the filling rate at 
the repining stage. Our data indicated that filling rate decreased significantly (by 8.85%, with a 5-day interval) as 
sowing date delay increased.

In additional, total dry matter of late rice among different sowing dates was averagely 1467~1526 g m−2, if HI 
was normal (about 0.5), theoretical yield was 7.3~7.6 t ha−1, our results also suggested that dry matter production 
was not affected as sowing date was delayed. However, reproductive redundancy increased by 7.72% in LR, with a 
5-day interval, following sowing date delay. Possible reason was that the inability to transfer aboveground biomass 
in the vegetative organs to grain yield in LR due to less effective accumulated temperature or low-temperature 
stress at anthesis was intensified as sowing date was delayed, although there was no significant correlation 
between effective accumulated temperature of growth duration after transplanting and aboveground biomass 
(P > 0.05) or HI (P > 0.05). Double cropped rice production in China is undergoing an unprecedented period 
of transition to large-scale mechanization14. Precondition of high annual rice yield under the double cropped 
rice production was high early rice yield and high late rice yield, therefore, reasonable allocation of limited 
thermo-unit conditions annually was the keys for rice growth and development and even yield. Adjusting sowing 
date (seedling age was fixed) was for improving allocation of limited thermo-unit conditions under the double 
cropped rice production. In this study, in view of low temperature stress under late rice season, and to promote 
high grain yield in mechanized large-scale farming, we examined ESD for LR, and determined that it should be 
no later than July 10 (a 10-day delay compared with the control), and that ESD for ER should be 10 days earlier 
than the control, rather than later. Even if reasonable ESD is adopted, the potential threat of meteorological fac-
tors, especially high and low temperatures15,16, remain a threat to sustainably increasing grain yield. The increase 
in reproductive redundancy observed in this study indicates that affecting yield remains a risk in this approach. 
Therefore, our results suggest that greater effort should be made to develop high-yield multi-resistant rice culti-
vars to meet the development of mechanized large-scale rice farming, whether via conventional breeding, bio-
technology, or both17. Growth duration of rice cultivars must also be considered18; our data demonstrate that 
thermal sensitive long-duration rice cultivars are appropriate for the early season, and day-neutral and thermal 
sensitive short-duration cultivars for the late season (e.g. 6,12).
conclusions
Elastic sowing dates (ESD) with low seeding rate was conductive to grain yield maintenance in mechanized 
large-scale double-cropped rice production. ESD for LR should be no later than July 10 (a 10-day delay compared 
with the control), and ESD for ER should be earlier sowing rather than later.
Materials and Methods
Experiments designs.  Field experiments were conducted in Yongan, Hunan Province, China (28°09′N, 
113°37′E, 43 m a.s.l.) in the early and late seasons in 2015 and 2016. Maximum and minimum temperatures 
between March 25 and November 22 were 26.8 °C and 19.3 °C in 2015, and 26.4 °C and 19.3 °C in 2016, respec-
tively (Fig. 2). High temperatures (daily maximum temperature ≥35 °C) occurred more frequently in 2016 than 
in 2015. Solar radiation between March 25 and November 22 were 13.9MJ/m2/d in 2015, and 13.3MJ/m2/d in 
2016, respectively (Fig. 3). The soil was clayey with a pH of averagely 6.30, organic matter content of averagely 
18.4 g kg−1, and total nitrogen (N) content of averagely 1.09 g kg−1. We performed a soil test using samples col-
lected from the upper 20 cm. The ER cultivars used in this study were Zhongzao 39 (ZZ39, inbred) in 2015 
and Lingliangyou268 (LLY268, hybrid) in 2016. The LR cultivars were Hyou 518 (HY518, hybrid) in 2015 and 
Taiyou390 (TY390, hybrid) in 2016. These four cultivars were selected because they are widely grown by rice 
farmers in the study region.

Table 4.  Grain yield in machine-transplanted double-cropped rice grown under different sowing periods in 
2015 and 2016. ER, early rice; LR, late rice. LSD, least significant difference at a significance level of P < 0.05.

Rice planting in a randomized block design was established with different sowing dates and three replicates 
in a 25-m2 plot. We planted 20-day-old ER seedlings on four sowing dates between March 25 (control) and April 
9, at 5-day intervals. We planted 15-day-old LR seedlings on five sowing dates between July 1 (control) and July 
21, at 5-day intervals.

Seeding was performed on paper using a single-seed printing seeder (HDBZJ-580-A, Hande Co. Ltd.), and 
sowing was performed using seedling trays (length × width × height = 58 cm × 25 cm × 2 cm) at a rate of 15 g 
per tray. According to local recommended density of ER and LR, the transplanting density was 28.5 hills per m2 
for early season (ER, row spacing × planting spacing = 25 cm × 14 cm), and 36.4 hills per m2 for late season (LR, 
25 cm × 11 cm).

One seedling was transplanted per hill. N content of the soil was 150.0 kg N ha−1 for ES and 165.0 kg N ha−1 for 
LS, with 70% of total N at basal dressing and 30% of total N at panicle initiation. Phosphorus (P) and potassium 
(K) rates were 75.0 kg P2O5 ha−1 and 120.0 kg K2O ha−1 for ES and 82.5 kg P2O5 ha−1 and 132.0 kg K2O ha−1 for LS. 
P was applied initially; K application was split equally between initial application after transplantation and at pan-
icle initiation. The water management strategy was flooding, followed by midseason drainage, re-flooding, moist 
intermittent irrigation, and drainage. Weeds, insects, and diseases were intensively controlled with chemicals.

Table 5.  Correlations between effective accumulated temperature and other indices. SO, sowing stage; TP,

Figure 2.  Daily mean temperature (Mean T), maximum temperature (Max T), minimum temperature (Min T) 
and solar radiation during the rice growing season from seeding to maturity of double rice in Yongan County, 
Hunan Province, China in 2015–2016.

Growth period, tillers, dry matter and yield attribute sampling.  Dates of sowing and the 
full-heading and mature stages were recorded accurately. Excluding the three border plants, 10 hills were labeled 
in each plot to count tillers at fixed intervals from 5 to 40 days after transplanting; 10 hills were sampled and 
aboveground biomass was determined in the flowering stage. In the mature stage, yield components were deter-
mined for 12 hills, including spikelet panicle−1, filling ratio, and grain weight. Finally, grain yield was determined 
in a selected 5-m2 area, and the effective number of panicles per m2 was determined for 20 hills.

Nutrition redundancy was calculated from the difference between the maximum number of tillers and the 
effective number of panicles per m2. Reproductive redundancy was calculated from the barren grain number 
and total grain number. Effective accumulated temperature at the different stages was calculated as the difference 
between daily average temperature and biological initial temperature (10 °C, Indica rice).
