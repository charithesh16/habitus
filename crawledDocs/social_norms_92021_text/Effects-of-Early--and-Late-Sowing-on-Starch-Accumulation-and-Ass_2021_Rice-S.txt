Abstract: The environmental temperature occurring during the grain filling stage is an important factor 
affecting  starch  synthesis  and  accumulation  in  rice.  We  investigated  starch  accumulation,  amylase 
activity and starch granule size distribution in two low-amylose japonica rice varieties, Nanjing 9108 and 
Fujing 1606, grown in the field at different filling temperatures by manipulating sowing date. The two rice 
varieties  exhibited  similar  performances  between  two  sowing  dates.  Total  starch,  amylose  and 
amylopectin contents were lower at the early-filling stage of T1 treatment (Early-sowing) compared with 
those at the same stage in T2 treatment (Late-sowing). In contrast,  at the late-filling stage, when field 
temperatures  were  generally  decreasing,  total  starch  and  amylopectin  contents  in  T1  were  higher 
compared to those in T2. The ideal temperature for strong activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 
and soluble starch synthase was about 22 ºC. A higher temperature from the heading to maturity stages 
in T1 increased the activities of starch branching enzyme and suppressed the activities of granule bound 
starch  synthetase  and  starch  debranching  enzyme.  We  found  that  rice  produced  larger-sized  starch 
granules under the T1 treatment. These results suggested that due to the early-sowing date, the high 
temperature  (30  ºC)  occurring  at  the  early-filling  stage  hindered  starch  synthesis  and  accumulation, 
however, the lower temperatures (22 ºC) at the late-filling stage allowed starch synthesis and accumulation 
to return to normal levels.

Rice  is  one  of  the  main  food  crops  consumed 
worldwide,  especially  in  Asian  countries.  Therefore, 
increasing  yield and improving rice grain quality are 
the most important goals for rice breeders. Rice starch, 
which  comprises  more  than  90%  of  the  weight  of 
polished  rice  grains,  is  an  important  factor  affecting 
yield  and  quality  (Syahariza  et  al,  2013).  Starch 
primarily consists of two branched glucose polymers, 
amylopectin  and  amylose.  Amylose  is  primarily  a 
linear molecule composed of glucose units linked by 
(cid:302)-1,4-glycosidic  bonds,  and  amylopectin  is  a  highly- 
(cid:69)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3) (cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3) (cid:69)(cid:92)(cid:3) (cid:302)-1,6-glycosidic  bonds, 

and  both  are  considered  determinants  of  rice  eating 
and cooking quality (Chung et al, 2011; Lin et al, 2011; 
Gilbert et al, 2013). In the process of starch accumulation, 
more than 30 major enzymes participate in the metabolism 
of  carbohydrates  during  endosperm  development  in 
rice. Among them, five enzymes play important roles 
in this process, which are ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 
(AGPase),  granule  bound  starch  synthetase  (GBSS), 
soluble  starch  synthase  (SSS),  starch  branching 
enzyme (SBE) and starch debranching enzyme (DBE) 
(Yang et al, 2001; Hannah and James, 2008; Chen and 
Bao,  2017).  The  main  function  of  AGPase  is  to

transform hexose, formed after sucrose decomposition, 
into adenosine diphosphate glucose (ADPG), a starch 
synthesis substrate. This is the first and limiting step 
of  the  starch  synthesis  reaction  (Tuncel  et  al,  2014). 
Increasing AGPase activity can regulate starch synthesis 
and  increase  seed  weight  (Smidansky  et  al,  2003; 
Tuncel and Okita, 2013). GBSS is mainly responsible 
for the synthesis of amylose, SSS mainly synthesizes 
amylopectin,  SBE  catalyzes  the  formation  of  (cid:302)-1,6- 
glycoside bond, while DBE hydrolyzes (cid:302)-1,6-glycoside 
bond (Satoh et al, 2003; Fujita et al, 2009; Jeon et al, 
2010). The activities of these five enzymes are closely 
related  to  total  starch,  amylose  and  amylopectin 
accumulation in rice endosperm.   

Enzymes  involved  in  starch  accumulation  are  not 
only  affected  by  genotype  but  also  the  growing 
environment of rice (Halford et al, 2015; Mayer et al, 
2016).  Many  previous  studies  found  that  abiotic 
factors such as fertilizer application, soil moisture and 
environmental temperature can affect enzyme activity 
and  subsequently,  change  total  starch,  amylose  and 
amylopectin contents (Sun et al, 2018; Cheng et al, 2019; 
Prathap  et  al,  2019).  Among  these  factors,  enzyme 
activities are reportedly very sensitive to environmental 
temperature from the heading to maturity stages (Cao 
et al, 2015). Moreover, increasing temperatures due to 
global climate change will likely affect plant enzyme 
activity and starch content (Sacks et al, 2010). Cheng 
et  al  (2019)  concluded  that  high,  medium  and  low 
daily average temperatures of 31 ºC, 26 ºC and 21 ºC 
can  significantly  affect  starch  synthetase  activity  and 
consequently,  affect  starch  accumulation.  Xia  et  al 
(2016) found that a low temperature during the grain 
filling  stage  can  decrease  the  activities  of  SSS  and 
SBE.  Ahmed  et  al  (2015)  found  that  the  activity  of 
SBE  in  rice  endosperm  increases  at  the  early  grain 
filling stage but decreases thereafter by heat stress.   

in  response 

Although  many  studies  have  investigated  changes 
to  different 
in  starch  accumulation 
environmental 
temperatures  during  grain  filling, 
results are not consistent. Also, most of those studies 
were carried out in controlled greenhouse. Greenhouse 
studies  are  unlikely  to  accurately  imitate  long-term 
rice cultivation in the field (Patindol et al, 2015). Thus, 
we conducted a field study to investigate the effects of 
environmental temperature on rice starch accumulation 
and  enzymes  associated  with  starch  accumulation. 
Moreover,  because  of  the  gap  of  knowledge  in  the 
literature  and  the  importance  of  the  stage  in  rice 
production, we examined temperature effects on field- 

grown rice at the grain filling stage. We selected two 
rice varieties with low-amylose content, Nanjing 9108 
(NJ9108)  and  Fujing  1606  (FJ1606),  because  they 
have  been  bred  and  widely  cultivated  (especially  in 
Jiangsu Province, China in recent years) for their good 
eating  and  cooking  quality  (Wang  et  al,  2009).  The 
overall  objective  of  this  study  was  to  examine  the 
effect  of  high  temperatures  during  the  early-filling 
stage on starch accumulation and the activities of five 
enzymes  associated  with  starch  accumulation  in  two 
low-amylose rice varieties grown in field conditions. 
RESULTS 
Starch accumulation   
Total starch contents of NJ9108 and FJ1606 increased 
rapidly  within  25  DAH  (days  after  heading)  and 
increased  slowly  from  40  DAH  to  maturity  (Fig.  1). 
Total  starch  contents  of  the  two  varieties  in  T1 
treatment  (sowing  date  was  10  May,  2018)  were 
initially lower than those in T2 treatment (sowing date 
was  21  June,  2018)  within  20  DAH,  and  then  the 
contents  were  nearly  the  same  between  the  two 
treatments at 25 DAH. Beyond 25 DAH, total starch 
contents in T1 were higher compared with those in T2 
in the both varieties. At 55 DAH, total starch contents 
of NJ9108 and FJ1606 were 5.6% and 4.2% higher in 
T1  than  in  T2,  respectively.  Amylose  contents  of 
NJ9108 and FJ1606 increased rapidly within 35 DAH, 
and  increased  slowly  from  40  DAH  to  maturity. 
Amylose contents of NJ9108 and FJ1606 in T1 were 
22.7% and 11.8% lower than those of the corresponding 
varieties  in  T2  at  55  DAH.  Amylopectin  contents  of 
the  two  varieties  increased  rapidly  within  25  DAH, 
and  increased  slowly  from  35  DAH  to  maturity. 
Amylopectin contents of the two varieties in T1 were 
initially  lower than those in T2 within 20 DAH, and 
then were nearly the same at 25 DAH. After 25 DAH, 
amylopectin  contents  in  T1  were  higher  compared 
with  those  in  T2.  At  the  end  of  sampling  times, 
amylopectin  contents  of  NJ9108  and  FJ1606  in  T1 
were  9.5%  and  6.4%  higher  than  those  in  T2.  This 
pattern  of  amylopectin  accumulation  as  affected  by 
different  temperature  treatments  was  very  similar  to 
that of total starch accumulation (Fig. 1).     
Key enzyme activities in starch synthesis 
Activities of AGPase and SSS first increased and then 
decreased  after  heading  (Fig.  2).  Of  both  varieties, 
AGPase  and  SSS  activities  in  T1  were  lower  than

after 30 DAH. The highest AGPase and SSS activities 
of NJ9108 and FJ1606 occurred in T1 were 13.8% and

heading to maturity. The highest levels of GBSS activity 
of  NJ9108  and  FJ1606  in  T1  were  23.6%  and  6.7% 
lower than those in T2, and the highest levels of DBE 
activity  of  the  two  varieties  in  T1  were  26.8%  and 
14.3% lower than those in T2, respectively. The pattern 
of SBE activity increased and then decreased (Fig. 2). 
The  SBE  activities  in  the  both  varieties  in  T1  were 
higher than those in T2 from heading to maturity. The 
highest  SBE  activities  of  NJ9108  and  FJ1606  in  T1 
were  40.3%  and  29.2%  higher  than  those  in  T2, 
respectively. 
Starch granule size distribution 
Average granule diameter of the two varieties rapidly 
increased within 15 DAH. Diameters of the two varieties 
in T1 were 6.4% and 4.4% lower than the respective 
diameters  in  T2  (Fig.  3).  In  the  both  varieties,  the 
contents of B-type starch granules quickly declined in 
contrast  to  the  increase  contents  of  A-type  starch 
granules within 15 DAH. The contents of B-type starch 
granules of the two varieties in T1 were respectively 
5.7% and 6.0% higher than those in T2.   
DISCUSSION 
Effects of early- and late-sowing on starch 
accumulation and enzyme activity 
Our  results  suggested  that  total  starch,  amylose  and 
amylopectin accumulation were differentially affected 

between  the  two  different  filling-temperature  groups. 
Total starch accumulation in T1 was lower than that in 
T2 at the early-filling stage (within 25 DAH), and then 
higher than that in T2 at the late-filling stage (Fig. 1). 
Ahmed  et  al  (2015)  found  that  a  higher  temperature 
(32  ºC)  during  grain  development  can  decrease  total 
starch  content  in  rice.  A  similar  result  was  found  in 
maize  (Zea  mays  L.)  by  Yang  et  al  (2017).  They 
reported  waxy  maize exposed  to  heat  stress  (29  ºC) 
during  the  grain  filling  stage  decreases  grain  dry 
weight  and  total  starch  content.  A  lower  total  starch 
content under higher temperature is mainly caused by 
low efficiency of starch biosynthesis (Liao et al, 2014; 
Cao et al, 2015). The pattern of AGPase activity was 
in consistent with that of total starch accumulation in 
the  T1  and  T2  groups.  At  the  early-filling  stage  of 
NJ9108 and FJ1606, the average daily temperatures in 
T1 were 27.37 ºC and 26.88 ºC, and the averages of 
daily highest temperatures reached 31.69 ºC and 31.18 ºC, 
respectively.  The  high  tempe(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:1939)(cid:3) (cid:22)(cid:19)(cid:3) ºC)  likely 
suppressed the activity of AGPase at the early-filling 
stage.  This  finding  is  similar  to  previous  studies  of 
Ahmed  et  al  (2015)  and  Cao  et  al  (2015),  which 
indicated that a high temperature (32 ºC) can suppress 
AGPase  activity  in  rice  endosperm  after  about  10 
DAH. By contrast, Zahedi et al (2003) determined that 
wheat grown at 30 ºC showed no changes in enzyme 
activities  compared  with  those  grown  at  a  lower 
temperature  (20  ºC).  The  contrasting  results  may  be

caused  by  two  possibilities.  Firstly,  the  two  different 
crop  species,  rice  and  wheat,  suggests  that  the  effect 
of higher temperatures on the activity of AGPase may 
be  species  dependent.  Secondly,  based  on  the  results 
of  Zahedi  et  al  (2003),  we  suspect  that  AGPase 
activity is not only affected by high temperatures but 
also  inhibited  by  low  temperatures.  This  point  is 
further supported by the study of Xia et al (2016) who 
concluded that exposure of three rice varieties to a low 
temperature  (17  ºC)  lowers  AGPase  activity  during 
grain  filling.  Our  study  also  provided  supportive 
evidence  from  the  late-filling  stage  data  in  the  both 
rice varieties. The activity of AGPase was lower in the 
lower temperature of T2 (approximately 16 ºC) than in 
T1 (approximately 22 ºC).   

Amylose  accumulation  in  the  two  varieties  in  T1 
was  lower  than  that  in  T2  from  heading  to  maturity 
stages (Fig. 1). Consistent with our finding, previous 
studies  have  also  shown  that  amylose  content  is 
reduced  by  higher  temperature  during  grain  filling 
(Ahmed  et  al,  2014;  Cheng  et  al,  2019).  Xia  et  al 
(2016)  reported  that  amylose  content  significantly 
increases  even  under  low  temperature  stress  (17  ºC) 
during the grain filling stage. Lower amylose content 
is mainly caused by lower activity of GBSS from the 
heading to maturity stages (Zhang et al, 2016). Although 
one  study  demonstrated  that  exposed  wheat  to  high 
temperature in a short time produces small effects on 
the activity of GBSS in wheat grains (Yan et al, 2008), 
more  studies  have  shown  that  high  temperatures 
occurring  at  grain  filling  decrease  the  activities  of 
GBSS in wheat and rice (Kaur et al, 2017; Duan et al, 
2019).  Furthermore,  SBE,  a  key  enzyme  involved  in 
amylopectin (cid:86)(cid:92)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:302)-1,4-glycoside 
bonds  in  amylose  and  then  catalyze  to  branches  of 
amylopectin (Abe et al, 2014; Brummell et al, 2015). 
Higher SBE activity in grains was found under higher 
temperatures  during  grain  filling  compared  with  that 
under  lower  temperatures.  In  this  study,  the  higher 
SBE  activity  in  T1  than  in  T2  from  the  heading  to 
maturity  stages  was  associated  with  the  higher  daily 
mean  temperature.  Therefore,  more  amylose  was 
likely converted to amylopectin due to the high SBE 
activity in T1. 

Previous  studies  have  reported  that  high  grain- 
filling  temperature  reduces  starch  content.  Luo  et  al 
(2007) determined that when daily mean temperatures 
higher than 24 ºC, amylopectin content decreases with 
increasing grain-filling temperature. Zhao et al (2008) 
also found lower amylopectin content in wheat grains 

exposed  to  a  high  grain-filling  temperature  (28  ºC) 
than to a low temperature (20 ºC). Consistent with those 
results, we observed lower amylopectin accumulation 
at the early-filling stage when daily mean temperatures 
were 27.32 ºC and 26.88 ºC (T1) than when daily mean 
temperatures were 22.49 ºC and 22.11 ºC (T2) for the 
two rice varieties. However, amylopectin accumulation 
in  T1  was  higher  than  that  in  T2  at  the  late-filling 
stage (Fig. 1), and the trend was similar to total starch 
accumulation. Inukai and Hirayama (2010) suggested 
that  amylopectin  content  per  grain  in  japonica  near- 
isogenic  lines  for  the  Wx  locus  is  greater  at  a  high 
grain-filling temperature (32 ºC). The different results 
imply that the effect of high temperature on amylopectin 
accumulation may be variety dependent.   

Amylopectin synthesis is mainly catalyzed by SSS, 
DBE  and  SBE,  which  are  responsible  for  modifying 
the branches of amylopectin. The trend of SSS activity 
was  similar  to  amylopectin  accumulation  from  the 
heading to maturity stages.  The SSS activities of the 
two rice varieties in T1 were lower than those in T2 at 
the early-filling stage, however, at the late-filling stage, 
the SSS activities in T1 were higher than those in T2. 
Other  researchers  have  also  shown  that  SSS  activity 
decreases  under  a  higher  grain-filling  temperature 
(Zhao  et  al,  2008;  Cheng  et  al,  2019)  or  a  low 
temperature  (17  ºC)  during  grain  filling  (Xia  et  al, 
2016).  Altogether,  these  results  suggest  that  SSS 
activity likely peaks at moderate temperatures at about 
22  ºC.  Xu  et  al  (2015)  studied  starch  synthesis 
enzymes in  maize grains and found that the time for 
AGPase, SSS and SBE activities to reach their peaks 
differed.  Their  results  are  consistent  with  our  results 
where the activities of AGPase and SSS peaked earlier 
than those of GBSS and DBE in T2. However, in T1, 
the  activities  of  AGPase,  SSS,  GBSS  and  DBE 
climaxed at about the same times. Similar results were 
observed in rice variety 9311 by Cao et al (2015), who 
found  similar  time  lengths  are  needed  for  AGPase, 
SSS and SBE activities to reach their maximums, and 
the  time  is  affected  by  filling-temperature.  Therefore, 
the  differences  of  peak  times  in  T1  and  T2  were 
probably  caused  by  filling-temperature  and  the  low- 
amylose content varieties used in this study. 
Effects of early- and late-sowing on starch granule 
size development and distribution 
Starch granule size distribution is an important factor 
that influences rice eating and cooking quality (Park et al, 
2009).  We  found  that  the  higher  temperature  during 

196                                                                                                                                                  Rice  Science,  Vol.  28,  No.  2,  2021(cid:3)

the  grain  filling  stage  increased  the  percentage  of 
large-sized  starch  granules  and  the  average  granule 
diameter.  We  also  observed  that  the  average  granule 
diameter  increased  rapidly  within  15  DAH.  This 
supported a previous study by Zhang et al (2010), who 
found  the  mean  diameter  of  wheat  starch  granules 
dramatically  increased  within  16  DAH.  The  SBE 
activity is reportedly responsible for changes in starch 
granule  size,  and  lack  of  it  hinders  granules  from 
reaching normal sizes (He et al, 2018). Therefore, the 
lower  grain-filling  temperature  might  have  reduced 
SBE activity, which in turn, decreased average granule 
diameter.   

Many previous researchers have demonstrated that 
higher  temperatures  (more  than  30  ºC)  during  grain 
filling  hamper  starch  synthesis  in  grain-producing 
crops through greenhouse or artificial climate chamber 
studies.  In  this  study,  we  used  two  different  sowing 
dates to create a high and low temperature difference 
while maintaining the natural changes in temperature 
during  the  grain  filling  period  and  to  determine  the 
more  suitable  temperature  for  starch  synthesis  and 
accumulation. In Jiangsu Province of China, an early- 
sowing date risks high-temperature stress during grain 
filling. Yet, our results suggested that the risk may be 
unwarranted.  Starch  synthesis  was  suppressed  by  the 
high  temperature  in  T1  at  the  early-filling  stage, 
however,  at  the  late-filling  stage,  when  daily  mean 
temperature was lower at approximately 20 ºC, starch 
synthesis  and  accumulation  in  T1  were  greater  than 
those in T2. We concluded that the high temperature 
stress caused by early-sowing (about 10 May) resulted 
in  little  to  no  damage  to  starch  accumulation  and 
synthesis in rice grains with low-amylose content. 

METHODS 

Rice materials   

Two varieties of Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica (Nanjing 9108 
and  Fujing  1606)  were  planted  at  the  farm  of  Yangzhou 
University,  China  (cid:11)(cid:20)(cid:20)(cid:28)(cid:158)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:397)  (cid:40)(cid:15)(cid:3) (cid:22)(cid:21)(cid:158)(cid:22)(cid:28)(cid:397)  N)  during  rice  growing 
season in 2018. The soil type was sandy loam and the preceding 
crop was wheat. Total availability of nitrogen, phosphorous and 
potassium were 1.4 g/kg, 35.1 mg/kg and 88.3 mg/kg, respectively. 
Plots  were  arranged  in  a  randomized  block  pattern  with  three 
replicates. Hill spacing was 30 cm × 12 cm with four seedlings 
per hill. The plot area was 15 m2 (5 m × 3 m). 

Sowing date 

Using the natural temporal changes in environmental temperature, 
we investigated the potential effects of temperature at the grain 
filling  stage  by  growing  the  two  rice  varieties  at  different 
periods. The rice varieties were sown in 2018 at the earliest (10 
May,  T1  treatment)  and  the  latest  (21  June,  T2  treatment) 
sowing  dates  practiced  by  local  rice  producers,  respectively. 
Then rice seedlings were transplanted on 30 May and 11 July, 
respectively.  Thus,  grain  filling  of  T1  rice  plants  occurred  in 
August to October with higher temperatures and that of T2 rice 
plants  encountered  in  September  to  November  with  lower 
temperatures. In this study, we divided the filling period into two 
stages:  early-filling  and  late-filling  stages,  where  each  stage 
totaled  approximately  25  d  according  to  total  starch  and 
amylopectin accumulation curve. Heading and maturity periods 
for each sowing treatment and averages of daily, daily highest, 
and daily lowest temperatures during the grain filling stage are 
listed in Table 1 and Fig. S1. 

Sampling 

After  flowering, about 200 panicles were chosen on  the same 
day  and  tagged  for  each  plot.  After  full  heading,  the  tagged 
panicles were sampled from each plot every  5 d at 10:00 am, 
and  the  grains  in  the  middle  of  the  tagged  panicles  were

collected (20 g). These collected grains were divided into two 
groups.  Half  of  them  were  used  to  determine  total  starch, 
amylose and amylopectin contents, and the other half were put 
in  liquid  nitrogen  for  3  min  and  then  stored  at  -80  ºC  for 
enzymatic analysis.   

Total starch, amylose and amylopectin analyses 

Total  starch  from  rice  flour  was  performed  using  commercial 
kits  manufactured  by  Sigma-Aldrich  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA) 
according  to  Zhu  et  al  (2017).  Amylose  and  amylopectin 
contents  were  determined  according  to  He  (1985)  with  minor 
changes. Amylose content was quantified at 620 and 479 nm, 
while amylopectin content was quantified at 556 and 737 nm, 
respectively. 

Enzyme extraction and assay 

The assays of enzymes were optimized for substrate concentration 
and pH. Ten grains were hand- homogenized by grinding at 4 ºC 
with  5  mL  extraction  buffer  (100  mmol/L  Tricine-NaOH,  pH 
7.5,  8  mmol/L  MgCl2,  2  mmol/L  EDTA,  12.5%  glycerol,  1% 
PVP-40 and 50 mmol/(cid:47)(cid:3)(cid:533)-mercaptoethanol). After centrifugation 
at 10 000 × g at 4 ºC for 10 min, the supernatant was used to 
determine enzyme activities.  The activities of  AGPase, GBSS 
and SSS were analyzed as described by Yang et al (2003) with 
minor  changes.  The  analysis  of  SBE  and  DBE  activities 
followed  Nakamura  et  al  (1989)  and  Nakamura  et  al  (1996) 
with minor changes, respectively.   

Starch granule distribution analysis 

Rice starch  was isolated from  flour as described by Wei et al 
(2010) with minor modifications. Starch granule size distribution 
was  investigated  using  a  Mastersizer  2000  laser  diffraction 
particle size analyzer (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, England) 
as  described  by  Zhu  et  al  (2017).  The  starch  samples  were 
immersed in absolute ethyl alcohol and stirred at 2 000 r/min. 
Starch  granule  size  was  classified  into  A-(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:3) (cid:11)(cid:149)  (cid:24)(cid:3) (cid:541)(cid:80)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)
B-type (< (cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:541)(cid:80)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:47)(cid:76)(cid:88)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:79) (2017). 

Statistical analyses   

Means of triplicate experimental values were used. All analyses 
were  conducted  and  analyzed  by  using  Microsoft  Excel  2016 
and SPSS. 23. Figures were drafted by SigmaPlot 10.0.
