Abstract 
In Senegal, rice plays a crucial role in combatting food insecurity since it is one of the most 
consumed staple crops. Despite this, national rice-production is insufficient in relation to the 
domestic demand, making Senegal one of West Africa’s most import-dependent countries in 
rice. To combat this issue, the Senegalese government aim to reach national self-sufficiency 
in rice production, primarily focused on the irrigated agricultural sector called the River Delta 
Valley. Previous research has highlighted that to increase agricultural productivity; it is 
essential to close the gender gap and to empower female farmers. This thesis has investigated 
how gendered differences in smallholder rice production in the River Delta Valley impacts 
agricultural productivity levels, agricultural management, and female farmers socio-economic 
situation. The study applied a mixed-methods data collection, involving a micro-survey, 
individual and group interviews and participating observations with both male and female 
farmers, guided by the methodology and analytical framework called Women’s 
Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI). It was found that while both male and female 
farmers have increased their rice production in comparison to the last ten years and the 
preceding generation, gendered differences which limit females’ potential in agricultural 
productivity remains. Some of these are inheritance and ownership of land, constraints in 
time and workload, and limited financial resources. Finally, it was observed that while female 
farmers had enjoyed increased economic opportunities in comparison to the preceding 
generation, this had resulted in the transfer of economic responsibilities from males to 
females. Ultimately, females were left with a heavier financial burden than before managing 
their individual economy. It was concluded that female empowerment is not a linear process 
since the improvement in one dimension of the concept might result in negative 
consequences in another dimension.

1. Introduction 

West Africa is largely characterized by agriculture-based economies whose small-scale low-
productivity result in insufficient agricultural yields and food insecurity (AGRA, 2017; FAO 
and AfDB, 2015). While at the macro level, GDP growth in African economies has been 
rapid with some signs of structural transformation, the inclusivity of growth processes can be 
questioned on several grounds. The prospects for leaving the agricultural sector altogether are 
small, as shown by income data that demonstrate the persistent role of agriculture in rural 
livelihoods across Africa as well as the poor opportunities for diversifying into high-return 
activities outside agriculture (Andersson-Djurfeldt et al. 2018:1-2). This has led to food 
import dependency and high exposure to international market shocks constraining countries’ 
food security and political stability (Agarwal, 2015; Seck et al. 2010; Nasrin et al. 2015; Saito 
et al. 2015). This is the case for the West-African staple food rice (Dawe, 2010). One of the 
region’s most rice import-dependent countries is Senegal, ranking among the world’s top-ten 
rice importers due to the growing population and urbanization resulting in consumers 
increasing demand for rice (Dawe, 2010:149; Diagne et al. 2013; Seck et al. 2010; Ministère 
de l’Agriculture, 2009). This is problematic since the global rice market is highly unstable 
and may be magnified by the effects of global climate change, such as the increasing risk of 
extreme weather events. This is what happened during the economic crisis in 2007–08, when 
food prices spiraled including both rice types ‘Thai 100%’ and ‘Thai 25’ who tripled in price 
(Senegal’s most imported rice varieties) (Dawe, 2010; Ministère de l’Agriculture, 2009; 
Ministère de l’Agriculture et de l’Equipement Rural, 2014:77). Although the 2007–08 price 
spike was especially dramatic, global food prices continue in an upward trend while price 
volatility risks remain (Agarwal, 2015). In response to this, the Senegalese government 
enforced the ‘National Program of Rice Self-Sufficiency’ (PNAR), part of Senegal’s 
grandiose national development plan ‘Plan Senegal Emergent’ (PSE) (République du 
Senegal, 2014; FAO, 2015; Ministère de l’Agriculture, 2009). The vision and goal of PNAR 
is to intensify the domestic rice sector through various investments in order to increase rice 
harvests and quality to eventually reach self-sufficiency in rice production (République du 
Senegal, 2014). These endeavors comply well with both academics and international 
organizations stating that increasing productivity and efficiency in developing countries’ 
agricultural sectors is key to agricultural transformation, resilience to fluctuating food prices 
on the global market, food security and ultimately to a nation’s development (FAO, 2011; 
Timmer in Eicher and Staatz, 1998:113-135; The World Bank, 2007:3,95).  

So, what then is needed to increase the agricultural productivity? While this question has a 
multitude of answers and solutions, one of them did for a long time remain in the dark. This 
solution concerns the utility of all farmers’ labor force, regardless of their gender. 
International organizations and academic researchers agree that to realize increased 
agricultural productivity, it is essential to close the gender gap and empower female farmers. 
Doing so would generate development opportunities both for women in agriculture and spill-
over benefits for their households and communities (FAO, 2011; Quisumbing et al. 2014). If 
women had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase agricultural 
yields on their farms by 20–30%, which could raise the total agricultural output with 2,5-4% 
which in turn could reduce the number of hungry people with 12-17% globally (FAO, 2011). 

1 

 

In addition, this can lead to more sustainable farming systems which can meet future 
demands for food and reduce financial costs of gender inequalities generating win-win 
opportunities for all stakeholders involved (FAO, 2011; AfDB, 2015; Quisumbing et al. 
2014; The World Bank, 2007; The World Bank et al. 2009; Maertens and Swinnen, 2012; 
Lopez-Carlos and Zahidi, 2005). Unfortunately, ‘closing the gender gap’ is often mentioned 
on paper but not always achieved on the ground. This is the case in Senegal’s northern rice 
sector the River Delta Valley where female farmers lack the same opportunities as males, 
while the government’s goal of reaching national self-sufficiency in rice production is not yet 
within sight (Ministère de l’Agriculture et de l’Equipement Rural, 2014:25-28, 47-50, 58; 
Ministère de Femme, de la Famille et de l’Enfance, 2016). Given the important role of rice 
production for Senegal’s agricultural development, this thesis takes its departure in the 
statement that closing the gender gap in the agricultural sector has the potential to improve 
productivity and efficiency in agricultural production (Quisumbing et al. 2014; FAO, 2011). 

1.1 Aim and research questions 
This thesis aims to explore what gendered differences exist between male and female 
smallholders in Senegal’s irrigated rice region called the River Delta Valley, and how the 
differences impact agricultural productivity, management, and female farmers socio-
economic situation. As agricultural development is a slow process, the research has collected 
participants’ insights from three points in time; present day, 10 years back and the preceding 
generation. The insights concerning the preceding generation were gathered by interviewing 
participants about their parents and grandparents. These three points in time were chosen to 
account for slow changes and not solely to provide the readers with a snapshot of the present-
day situation. The data was collected using a micro-survey, individual, and group interviews 
guided by the methodology and analytical framework called Women’s Empowerment in 
Agriculture Index (A-WEAI). This empirical study connects to the academic discussion on 
the impacts of the gendered division of labor onto agricultural productivity. This aim will be 
fulfilled through the research questions below. 

Research question 1 

What gender differences in productivity levels can be observed in Senegal’s 
smallholder family rice productions in the River Delta Valley over the last 10 
years and the preceding generation? 

Research question 2 

What gender differences in agricultural management can be observed in 
Senegal’s smallholder family rice productions in the River Delta Valley over the 
last 10 years and the preceding generation? 

Research question 3 

What effects have the previous developments in the River Delta Valley’s rice 
agriculture had on female farmers’ socio-economic situation? 

1.2 Relevance 
Aside from gender equality which holds intrinsic value as it is a fundamental human right, 
this thesis applies its relevance to the statement that closing the gender gap has the potential 
to improve productivity and efficiency in agricultural production. As promoted by the FAO 

2 

 

and academic research in the field of pro-poor agricultural development; increasing the 
understanding of women’s role in agriculture is important for social development, 
agricultural productivity and food security purposes (Quisumbing et al. 2014; FAO, 2011). 
These motivations are mutually reinforcing as one can help to reinforce the other 
(Quisumbing et al. 2014:6-7). 

In addition, this thesis is also relevant as it adds new perspectives to the role of female 
farmers in the River Delta Valley’s rice cultivations by using the A-WEAI framework in a 
qualitative/mixed method-approach. In contrast to previous research, which has utilized 
quantitative methods to calculate present levels of female empowerment in agriculture, this 
thesis provides qualitative insights of female empowerment over time through a mixed-
methods data collection. The thesis also adds a new perspective by connecting gender 
differentials in rice cultivation with their effects on smallholders’ agricultural productivity-
levels over time. Qualitative data on gender differences in rice productivity may be useful to 
overcome Senegal’s pertaining problems of poverty, food insecurity, inefficient agricultural 
productivity, subsistence farming, and persisting gender gaps. In combatting these problems, 
the thesis may prove valuable to both the Senegalese government, state employees, and civil 
society or organizations addressing gender issues and endeavors of reaching self-sufficiency 
in rice production. Ultimately, these issues amount to the SDG’s; 1- No Poverty, 2-Zero 
Hunger, and 5- Gender Equality, which are vital to address in order to assist in developmental 
processes. 

1.3 Outline of the thesis 
The thesis is structured according to the following order. While the first section introduced 
the thesis topic, aim, research questions, and its relevance, the second section gives some 
background information to the topic, including the role of rice in West Africa and Senegal as 
well as an overview to Senegal’s economy and labor force composition. The third section 
discusses the previous literature relevant to the thesis topic. This includes the gender gap in 
agriculture, academic debates on African agriculture, and empowerment of Senegalese 
female farmers. The fourth section discusses the thesis analytical framework based on 
Timmer’s theory of the agricultural transformation, pro-poor agriculture, women’s 
empowerment, and the operationalization through the A-WEAI framework. The fifth section 
concerns the thesis methodology, divided into several subsections including, the research 
design, quantitative and qualitative methods, sampling and analytical strategies, biases and 
ethical considerations and delimitations. The sixth section contains the analytical results and 
analysis, divided into five sub-sections, including, an overview of the data collection location, 
the results according to the A-WEAI framework, and theoretical reflections. The final 
sections include the conclusion, bibliography, and appendix. 

2 Background 

2.1 The role of rice in West Africa and Senegal 
Rice is an important staple in West Africa as it is one of the most important sources of 
calories (Grow Africa, 2019:3). Unfortunately, many West African countries are struggling 
with increasing rice consumption, in combination with insufficient production levels. 
Therefore, countries have turned to rice imports, to compensate for these divergent trends. 

3 

 

West Africa is by far the largest African region of rice imports, accounting for 60 percent of 
sub-Saharan Africa’s imports in 2005 (Dawe, 2010:175). Looking at rice consumption per 
capita, West African countries consume the most rice in all of Sub-Saharan Africa. The top 
five rice-consuming countries in the region from 2000–2003 were Guinea Bissau 
(86kg/person), Sierra Leone (83kg/person), Guinea (76kg/person), Senegal (74kg/person), 
and Côte d’Ivoire (60kg/person) (Dawe, 2010:169). As shown in figures 1 and 2 just below, 
while the most prominent country in the West African rice trade is Nigeria with the highest 
numbers of both production and imports, Senegal is not far behind. Despite Senegal being 
amongst the highest rice-consuming countries, their national self-sufficiency ratio in rice is 
meager in comparison to their neighboring countries. Self-sufficiency ratio, which 
summarizes the production, consumption, and trade data, has declined in Senegal from about 
25 percent in the 1960s to nearly 15 percent by 2006 (Dawe, 2010:146). Instead, it is Mali, 
Guinea, and Sierra Leone, which were in the top of West African rice self-sufficiency in 2016 
(Grow Africa, 2019:5).

The risks accompanied with the West African nations’ high dependence on rice imports 
become apparent, given the volatile prices on the global market. Although the price spike in 
2007/2008, has not yet been surpassed, international prices for all rice types are steadily 
rising and are now at their highest since 2014 (FAO, 2018a:22-23). Globally, the largest rice 
exporting countries are situated in Asia, which on average exported 35.8 million tons of rice 
out of the global production of 43.6 million tons, between the years 2013-2015 (FAO, 
2018a:33). The major rice export countries include India, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, but 
also the USA (FAO, 2018a:17,33). These are also the countries who are the major exporters 
to the Senegalese rice market, with India as the largest exporter, followed by Thailand, 
Brazil, and Pakistan (in descending order) in the year of 2016 (The Observatory of Economic 
Complexity, 2019). While most of the West African governments have taken action to 
decrease dependency on rice imports by enrolling agricultural development plans to expand 
national rice production, imports still dominate consumption (Dawe, 2010:144). 

Looking at the role of rice in Senegal, this has become more prominent over the last decades. 
In response to the increasing demands for rice, the domestic supply has also increased. 
However, this consists predominantly of imports instead of domestically produced rice, as 
shown in figure 3, below.

Senegal’s rice cultivation is mainly located to the River Delta Valley in the north, in addition 
to the Casamance region in the south. While Casamance relies on rain-fed rice due to its 
tropical climate, the River Delta Valley is today characterized by more advanced forms of 
agriculture including irrigation systems which were introduced not long after Senegal’s 
independence from France in 1960 (Devey, 2000). Some decades after that, conventional 
high-intensive farming techniques were also adopted, including fertilizer, pesticides, 
improved seed varieties, better infrastructure and formalizations of land rights (Koopman, 
2009; République du Senegal, 2014). The study focus on the River Delta Valley due to its 
agricultural developments, and its many efforts to increase rice productivity (from both the 
Senegalese government’s, private-public partnerships, private investments and many NGO’s) 

5 

 

in comparison to the Casamance region (Koopman, 2009; République du Senegal, 2014). The 
Valley region is characterized by its semi-arid climate, which is typical for the Sahel (semi-
desert) environment. The region has two cultivation season per year, which is the ‘hivernage’ 
(wet season) and the ‘contre saison chaud’ (dry season) (Devey, 2000:14).  

Historically, rice cultivation in Senegal was characterized by a gendered division of access to 
irrigation technologies, as women traditionally cultivated rice for domestic consumption 
being dependent on rain downfall while men cultivate rice for sales on the local market 
(Ministère de Femme, de la Famille et de l’Enfance, 2016:76). Due to the patriarchal society, 
men had a monopoly over productive resources (Niang et al. 2017). The beginning of 1965 
witnessed the creation of the Société d’Aménagements et d’Éxploitation des terres du Delta 
du fleuve (SAED), a governmental institution which over time transformed the region’s rice 
cultivation from using rain-fed agricultural practices to using irrigated ones (Devey, 
2000:42). This development was further motivated by a severe drought in the 1970s, bringing 
famine to the Valley since food production largely depended on rainfall or floods (Connor et 
al. 2008; Devey, 2000:44). In the 1990s, the IMF’s and WB’s Structural Adjustment 
Programs released the state’s monopoly of the Senegalese rice sector in addition to 
devaluating the national currency (CFA). This imposed a significant economic shock on the 
River Delta Valley’s rice sector (SAED, 2001). Today, Senegal’s rice sector face many 
problems such as; drought, soil salinity, unpredictable weather, overall increasing rice 
consumption due to population growth and urbanization, popularity, availability and low 
price of imported rice in combination with bad quality and value chain imbalances of 
domestically produced rice (Ministère de l’Agriculture, 2009:1, 5; Ministère de l’Agriculture 
et de l’Equipement Rural, 2014:28). Access to agricultural lands is also a significant problem 
in Senegal due to renewed interest in agriculture by various stakeholders, land saturation and 
fragmentation resulting in a decreasing number of smallholder farms. These problems seem 
to be caused by various factors, most notably demographic growth, climate change, large-
scale land acquisitions, state agricultural projects, and the emergence and expansion of local 
land markets. Land governance is problematic because local producers are caught between 
three systems: the legal system; customary norms; and actual practices on the ground (Niang 
et al. 2017). 

Looking to gender differentials in Senegal’s agricultural sector, rural women are among the 
groups that find it hardest to access land. Rural women are constrained because of 
sociocultural factors that deny them control over land resources, but also because the land 
legislation that does support them is not enforced. Rural women are victims of an inequitable 
and highly patriarchal social structure that prevents them from accessing and controlling their 
means of production (Niang et al. 2017:9). For example, the inheritance of land still functions 
according to customary land rights and is dependent on women’s marital status, meaning that 
women risk losing their land if they get divorced or widowed (Koopman, 2009). Looking at 
gender disparity statistics, Senegal’s ranking in the gender inequality index has not witnessed 
any improvements in women’s rights. The score of 2018 was set to 0.682, in comparison to 
0.6923 in 2013 (World Economic Forum, 2013;2018). The ranking index states that the 
higher the score, the more gender-equal the society is. This means that Senegal’s level of 
gender equality has decreased by 1.49 percent from 2013 to 2018.

2.2 Senegal’s economy and labor force composition 
To better understand the role of rice in Senegal, we will now look at Senegal’s economy at 
large, and its labor force composition, which indicates a growing service sector. While figure 
4 indicates that the majority of the labor force have transferred from the agricultural sector to 
the service sector, this corresponds to figure 5 indicating that the economic value of service 
sector has increased significantly in comparison to the agricultural sector. However, it should 
be highlighted that the informal sector in Senegal is significantly larger than the formal, 
meaning that important information may be hidden from official records (World Bank 
(2019).

Industry (including construction)

Agriculture, forestry, and fishing

 

The World Bank has appointed input intensification as the main driver to Senegal’s 
agricultural growth and not increasing productivity (The World Bank, 2018:27). Other 
obstacles to the advancement of the Senegalese economy includes; the large informal sector 
and the limited impact of recent improvements in agricultural output and job creation, and 
stagnation in the expansion of the formal sector (République du Senegal, 2014:25-26; The 
World Bank, 2018:xi). To come to terms with the many obstacles Senegal’s agricultural 
sector face, the government has initiated a number of development initiatives. The Senegalese 
government adopted the grand national development strategy called the Emerging Senegal 
Plan (PSE) in November 2012. PSE aims to make Senegal an emerging economy by 2035 
through specific development strategies for each economic sector (République du Senegal, 
2014). The agricultural development plan is called PRACAS, which includes the 
government’s solution of mono-cropping and production specialization to reach self-
sufficiency in rice consumption (called PNAR- the ‘National Program of Rice Self-
Sufficiency’). This contrast sharply with the River Delta Valley’s smallholders’ farming 
techniques which opt for crop diversification to better manage climate-risks and hunger 
during the difficult seasons (Niang et al. 2017). On the bright side, the government has a clear 
focus to improve the role of females in the development process. As an example, the 
government has established an institution targeting gender equality and the promotion and 

7 

 

reinforcement of females’ role in Senegal. This is in charge of gender development goals 
published in the latest report called the SNEEG, covering the period of 2016-2026 (FAO, 
2018b:25; Ministère de Femme, de la Famille et de l’Enfance, 2016). Within the agricultural 
sector, the emphasis is made to minimize the gender-gap by improving female farmers 
inclusion, access to the factors of production such as land, inputs, finances, credit, 
agricultural infrastructure, and equipment as well as reinforcement of female leadership 
(FAO, 2018b:20,73). This is mentioned in PRACAS. 

3 Literature review 
This section of the thesis will in three subsections discuss the previous research and academic 
debates regarding gender differences in agriculture and their impact on productivity. The first 
will give an overview of the gender gap in agriculture as well as some academic disparities in 
the field. The second subsection will discuss academic debates regarding the main tenants in 
agricultural developmental research and the issue of agricultural productivity. The third 
subsection will touch upon how female empowerment is regarded as a solution to 
productivity deficiencies in agriculture, set in the context of Senegal. The literature review 
has limited its focus to studies in predominantly the West African but also the African 
context at large. 

3.1 The gender gap in agriculture 
Esther Boserup was one of the first and pathbreaking researchers on the issue of gender gaps 
in developmental processes and the field of agricultural development. In her research, 
Boserup has drawn explicit attention to the gendered division of labor which arises in both 
‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ agricultural systems meaning that men and women experience the 
transition to modernity in different ways (Boserup, 1970). Boserup argued that economic 
development could not be fully evaluated without the recognition of the multitude of ‘hidden 
contributions’ of women throughout the world, particularly in the form of unpaid work. She 
discussed the gendered economy by highlighting women’s economic marginalization since 
they earn less than men in their roles as wage workers, farmers, and traders. She also 
highlighted that the mechanization of agriculture, which is generally equated with economic 
development, has resulted in the separation of women’s labor from waged agricultural labor, 
which in turn undermines their social status (Visvanathan et al. 2011:29). While the 
complexities of women’s work had previously been ignored or downplayed, Boserup brought 
them into the academic limelight (Quisumbing et al. 2014:8). Building on Boserup’s work, 
the liberal feminist researchers called ‘Women In Development’ (WID), have emphasized the 
importance of women in the development process, both for the benefits of women but also for 
the efficiency of the development. While the WID approach was criticized for overlooking 
the importance of social and political structures, it made an important correlation between 
work and status which previously had been ignored (Visvanathan et al. 2011:29-30).  

Today, most scholars agree that the many constraints faced by women in agriculture hamper 
their agricultural productivity (Quisumbing et al. 2014; Croppenstedth et al. 2013; Udry, 
1996; Udry et al. 1995; Goldstein and Udry, 2008; Diiro et al. 2018). The well-cited report 
from FAO called “The state of food and agriculture – Women in agriculture, closing the 
gender gap for development” made it clear that agriculture is underperforming because half 

8 

 

of its farmers-women- do not have equal access to the resources and opportunities in order to 
reach full productivity (FAO, 2011). The consensus states that women in agriculture face an 
array of gender-specific constraints based on norms and institutions on all levels of society 
and which are engrained in the social structure. Such constraints are; limited access and rights 
to land, credit, production inputs (fertilizer, irrigation, pesticides etc), markets, technology, 
other agricultural assets, lower access to male labor, oxen, and extension services; and 
difficulties in ensuring timely ploughing, weeding, or transportation etc. Women often work 
as unpaid laborers on family farms or other fields under insecure tenure arrangements which 
hampers investment incentives. Further, women face social restrictions in public participation 
and mobility, which restricts their ability to function fully as farmers. Women tend to face 
heavier workloads, while men control the generated cash. While trends differ in relation to 
age, marital status, access to credit and extension services etc, women are overall less likely 
to adopt yield-enhancing and soil-restoring strategies such as high yielding crop varieties, 
improved management systems and agricultural technology (Quisumbing et al. 2014; 
Andersson-Djurfeldt et al. 2018:2; Agarwal, 2015; World Bank 2009; FAO 2011; Doss, 
2001; Theriault et al. 2017). These systemic productivity gaps act in favor of male-headed 
households, while women face dual exclusions, not only because of lacking agricultural 
assets but also because of their limited access to alternative livelihood sources outside of 
agriculture (Andersson-Djurfeldt et al. 2018:4, 6). Another important dimension to the 
gendered differences, throughout all sectors of women’s everyday life is called ‘women’s 
double burden’ (Hochschild and Machung, 1990). ‘Women’s double burden’ refers to the 
hidden and unpaid work that women do in comparison to men who only have their paid job. 
The hidden and unpaid burden which most often is assigned to women revolves around 
housework and the care of children which occupies their time in addition to their paid work. 
Due to the ‘double burden,’ women end up having two jobs while men only have one 
(Hochschild and Machung, 1990). Thus, bridging productivity differentials between male and 
female farmers, by helping women overcome production constraints is vital as this could 
significantly increase agricultural output (Agarwal, 2015).  

Although most academics agree that women in general, occupy a disfavored role in 
agriculture and society at large, several debates exist on the subject. Some scholars have 
criticized both the academic research and the field at large for spreading ‘stylized facts’ about 
women’s role in agriculture, especially in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Recent research 
states that commonly cited ‘facts’ about women in agriculture are exaggerated, suggesting 
that (1) 70% of the worlds poor are women, (2) women produce 60-80% of the world’s food, 
(3) women own 1% of the world’s land and that (4) women are better stewards for the 
environment (Doss et al. 2018). Palacios-Lopez et al. (2017) found that the average female 
labor share in crop production is approximately 40%, by using individual, plot-level labor 
input data from nationally representative household surveys across six Sub-Saharan African 
countries. Other ‘stylized facts’ which have been refuted are that; women provide the bulk of 
labor in African agriculture, agricultural commercialization always enhances nutrition, and 
that labor in the agricultural sector is much less productive than other sectors (Christiansen, 
2017). The so-called ‘facts’ are founded on the premise that women control too few resources 
to fulfill their responsibilities to ensure food and nutrition security for themselves and their 
families. However, critics are concerned that this promotes stereotypes of women as either 
victims or saviors, that they treat women as a monolithic group, ignore the role of men, 

9 

 

communities, and institutions, and that they provide a simplistic and even misleading basis 
for the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies and programs to promote food 
security and advance gender equality (Doss et al. 2018; Christiansen, 2017). The confusion 
that these debates and conflicting information create can be harmful to the continued 
confidence in reports, publications, and campaigns by NGO’s and IO’s on the issue of the 
gender gap in agriculture. 

3.2 Academic debates on African agriculture 
The academic field of agricultural development has been characterized by many debates, 
resulting in shifting paradigms and new consensus on the debated topic. Three of these 
debates will be discussed below. 

The first academic debate concerns which factors that are causing the most substantial 
productivity deficiencies in agriculture. This is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to 
isolate social, cultural, environmental, and economic factors from one another to know which 
one has the greatest effect on agricultural productivity. Previous research has had differing 
results on how the social organization in agriculture, such as the gendered division of labor 
affects agricultural productivity. Both Quisumbing (1996) and Peterman et al. (2011) 
criticizes previous research by not accounting for gender-specific constraints when estimating 
agricultural productivity levels, leading to distorted analytical findings stating that males are 
more productive than females. They argue that when men and women are given the same 
opportunities, they are equally as efficient farmers. Previous research has excluded 
measurements on males’ and females’ differences in agricultural inputs and outputs, controls 
for individual characteristics, such as education and physical assets, and ignoring other 
gendered context-specific constraints. Instead, it has often been assumed that female farmers 
are less productive due to the fact of being women and not because they had fewer resources. 
These methodological issues have led to gender-biased research (ibid.). 

The second academic debate concerns the previous main tenant of agricultural economics 
called the ‘Pareto efficiency.’ Since this assumes that farming households share the factors of 
production in an equal distribution (called the co-operative model), gender-specific 
constraints remain hidden. ‘Pareto efficiency’ is based on the neoclassical theory, which 
assumes that people behave according to the most logical reasoning and thus make choices 
which maximize output. In the case of agricultural production, this means that intrahousehold 
resources would be equally allocated since it would maximize its’ efficiency. This implies 
that yields should be the same on all plots within a household in a given year (of course 
controlling for plot characteristics) since each plot would contain one crop (Quisumbing et al. 
2014; Croppenstedth et al. 2013; Udry et al. 1995; Udry, 1996; Goldstein and Udry, 2008; 
Diiro et al. 2018). However, the assumption of ‘Pareto efficiency,’ has been proven wrong as 
in much of Sub-Saharan Africa since different members of the household simultaneously 
cultivate the same crop on different plots while gaining different sized harvests and incomes 
(Udry et al. 1995; Udry, 1996; Quisumbing, 2003:58-62). Further on, the management of 
African farming households is very complex, including gendered divisions of labor, which 
more resembles split economies rather than the pooling of resources (called the non-co-
operative model). In the non-co-operative model, resources are unequally allocated within the 
household which poses negative effects on the household productivity (Udry et al. 1995; 
Quisumbing, 2003:58-62; Quisumbing et al. 2014). Economists have come to view 

10 

 

households as domains of difference, where multiple decision-makers may have different 
preferences and, in many cases, control separate sets of resources. The distribution of power 
and resources depends on the bargaining power within the household, which almost always 
favors men (Quisumbing, 2003:12). The rejection of the ‘Pareto efficiency’ thesis has greatly 
improved the understanding of household resource allocation behavior. It has demonstrated 
that heterogeneity among members affects a variety of individual, household, and 
economywide outcomes (Quisumbing, 2003:11,19,67). However, the debate of the ‘Pareto 
efficiency’ thesis, continues as some scholars argue that the refusal of ‘Pareto efficiency’ and 
the emphasis on the ‘non-co-operative model’ of agricultural management has led to an 
academic tendency to assume that households are only characterized by competing gender 
interests. Such criticism has been raised by Kabeer (Kabeer in SIDA, 2001), arguing that 
while intrahousehold gender inequalities about work and crop disposal may be affecting 
levels of productivity, it cannot be used as the general explanation for low productivity. This 
is because households consist of joint and competing gender interests (co-operative and non-
co-operative models) depending on the context and setting. Therefore, Kabeer argues that the 
focus should lie with the wider economic environment of poor rural households and gender 
differences in relations to this. 

The third academic debate concerns the assumption that crops are divided according to 
gender, where cash and export crops are “male crops” while subsistence crops are “female 
crops.” This is because women primarily are responsible for feeding the family while males 
are responsible for providing the family with cash income. When agricultural tools and 
techniques are introduced in the production process, in addition to the commercialization of a 
crop, this transfers the crop from being a “female crop” to a “male crop.” This assumption 
was supported by Braun and Webb (1989), who found that rice is becoming more of a male 
crop since technology and production efficiency tools are incorporated into the production. 
While this research is now becoming outdated, their findings are interesting to this thesis as 
Braun and Webb studied rice production in the Gambia, a country which shares many 
characteristics with Senegal as it is located within Senegal’s borders. Thus, technology inputs 
can have the impact of moving production out of female into male responsibilities. This 
assumption was also supported by Smith and Chavas (1997) who found that the 
commercialization of agricultural productions in West African households was normally done 
by increasing the production on male managed communal lands, meaning that husbands 
controlled the increased income. Ultimately this had a negative effect on women because 
West African households’ functions according to the non-co-operative model of non-pooling 
meaning that husbands and wives do not share their incomes but have fixed roles and 
obligations. On the other side of the debate, Doss (2001) problematizes Smith and Chavas 
(1997) conclusion by arguing that the gendered division of labor cannot simply be explained 
as the ‘non-sharing of income’ and ‘fixed roles and obligations.’ Doss argues that because 
African households are complex, heterogeneous, and gender roles change in response to new 
economic opportunities such as technology insertions, it cannot easily be summarized. 
Ultimately, gender roles are dependent upon context-specific attributes, which may result in 
different results.

3.3 Empowerment of Senegalese female farmers 
While previous research has appointed various issues and solutions to insufficient agricultural 
yields, the reader is reminded that the focus of this thesis is the gender gap in the form of the 
gendered division of labor and its negative effects on agricultural productivity. With this 
focus in mind, scholars and International Organizations argue that to solve the lack of 
women’s inclusion in the agricultural field, it is essential to close the gender gap by raising 
women’s empowerment (Agarwal, 2015;Diiro et al. 2018; FAO, 2011; The World 
Bank/IFAD/FAO, 2009). Several empirical findings have revealed a positive relationship 
between women’s empowerment and agricultural productivity. First, the study by Koopman 
(2009), aims to explain why food insecurity and poverty is so prevailing in the River Delta 
Valley in northern Senegal despite impressive investments in modernizing the agricultural 
sector. Part of Koopman’s conclusion is that it is critical to improve women’s access to land 
and technology in order to improve farm productivity and food security. A similar conclusion 
is drawn from the study by Bernard et al. (2018), researching female empowerment in 
decision-making and the relation between decision maker-identity and milk productivity in 
Senegal’s dairy farming. The study revealed that households in which husbands or wives 
decide because they are ‘most informed’ produce the most milk (Bernard et al. 2018). Thus, 
by empowering women through increased knowledge and education, milk productivity has 
the potential to increase since decisions are made consciously. 

Looking at the most recent evaluation of female empowerment in agriculture set to the River 
Delta Valley, it was found that women were relatively empowered with an overall score of 
0.783 out of possible 1.0. However, the main constraints to female farmers empowerment as 
identified by respondents included a lack of participation in household decision-making on 
production, lack of involvement in community groups, and inadequate access to and 
management of agricultural credit (IPAR and RTI International, 2018:1). The data suggested 
that workload was not a major constraint to empowerment, though it had a greater burden on 
women in the rainy season when agricultural activities are more time-consuming. While land 
ownership was not found to be a major contribution to women’s disempowerment based on 
the quantitative data, women reported in interviews and focus groups that access to land was 
a major constraint. Not surprisingly, the empowerment score for men was, on average, higher 
than the score for women (IPAR and RTI International, 2018:1). Finally, these results are 
supported when looking at an earlier study by Grigsby (2004), researching the gendered 
nature of subsistence farming and its effect on customary land tenure in Senegal. Grigsby 
found that men considered women’s contributions to the subsistence enterprise as secondary 
to their own responsibilities when organizing communal grain production. In addition, when 
looking into the various measurements of females’ roles in agriculture, Grigsby found that 
females were worse off in nearly every aspect. 

4 Analytical framework 
This section, which presents the analytical framework of the thesis, is divided into three parts. 
The first part will discuss the importance of agricultural transformation and the path of 
smallholder pro-poor agriculture to create national development. The second part will discuss 
women’s empowerment and its insertion in the field of agriculture. The third part will present 

 

12 

the A-WEAI, and its five domains, which, will serve as the analytical framework in the thesis 
operationalization. 

4.1 Agricultural transformation & the smallholder pro-poor approach 
The thesis is based on the theoretical premise of agricultural transformation, which states that 
for a nation to develop, it needs to go through four phases resulting in increased agricultural 
productivity. In the first phase, agricultural productivity per worker increases which in the 
second phase means that excess labor and financial surplus gets transferred from the 
agricultural into other sectors, normally the industrial or service sectors in urban areas. In the 
third phase, the agricultural sector gets progressively integrated into the macro-economy via 
improved infrastructure and market-equilibrium linkages. When the third phase is conducted 
successfully, the fourth phase is barely noticeable as the role of the agricultural sector in 
industrialized economies is not so different from the industry, housing, or insurance sectors. 
Finally, agriculture declines in its relative share of total gross domestic product (GDP) over 
time, even as the absolute value of farm output continues to grow. However, upholding 
agricultural protection through policies is critical in assuring a thriving agricultural sector as 
foreign competition from the global market otherwise risk undermining its function (Timmer, 
1998:116). The theoretical concept of agricultural transformation appoints the factor 
endowments; land, labor, and capital as the necessary preconditions for economic progress 
and development pathways (Timmer, 1998).  

The theoretical concept of the agricultural transformation will be used to contextualize 
Senegal’s rice cultivation in the sense of agricultural development and the importance of 
increased agricultural productivity. According to this concept, Senegal has to make its 
agricultural sector more efficient in order to embark on the ‘agricultural transformation’-
journey. However, two opposite solutions to do so can be distinguished. On the one hand, the 
smallholder-based approach under the title of pro-poor agricultural growth stands in 
opposition to the approach of large-scale farming. The first approach draws inspiration from 
the empirical example of the Asian Green Revolution, which subscribe to two interconnected 
theoretical assumptions: that small-scale farmers are efficient producers and that increased 
commercialization among them can encourage broad-based poverty reduction and growth. 
Thus, raising smallholder productivity, enhancing commercialization, and dealing with weak 
producer incentives for food staples are seen as the vehicles for achieving broad-based 
agricultural growth and reducing poverty (Andersson-Djurfeldt et al. 2018). Encouraging 
smallholder inclusion in agricultural value chains at different scales is in this respect crucial. 
Diversification within agriculture towards higher-value crops and a gradual movement into 
the non-farm sector in this way presages a gradual exit out of agriculture as the economy 
moves through the process of structural transformation (Andersson-Djurfeldt et al. 2018:3). 
In opposition, the proponents of large-scale farming question the efficiency of small-scale 
producers since modern technologies, and procurement systems have undermined the inverse 
relationship between productivity and land size that underpins the notion of superior 
smallholder efficiency. Other criticisms are the poor fit of an Asian-inspired smallholder 
model to African conditions and the market optimism of the pro-poor agricultural growth 
model as the insertion of smallholders into local, and sometimes global value chains 
encourage polarization of assets and incomes, as accumulation among the more well-
positioned leads to the marginalization of the poor. As such, both food security and poverty 

13 

 

reduction are better achieved through large-scale agriculture (Andersson-Djurfeldt et al. 
2018:4). 

4.2 Women’s empowerment in agriculture 
The thesis analytical framework is also founded on the premise that to reach increased 
agricultural productivity; it is necessary to decrease the gender gap in the agricultural labor 
force. Scholars argue that ‘closing the gender gap has the potential to improve productivity 
and efficiency in agricultural production’ (Quisumbing et al. 2014; FAO, 2011). In addition, 
increasing the resources controlled by women and their decision-making power may have 
several benefits. This is because women tend to reallocate their resources to improve 
children’s health, nutrition and education as well as other family needs, instead of focusing 
on their individual needs (Quisumbing, 2003:11,13). Thus, reducing inequalities in human 
capital, physical capital, and current inputs between male and female farmers in addition to 
increasing the understanding of women’s role in agriculture are important factors to open up 
doors for social development, agricultural productivity and food security purposes 
(Quisumbing et al. 2014; FAO, 2011; Quisumbing, 2003:13). 

While many academics have aimed to conceptualize women’s empowerment in agriculture, 
this thesis will utilize the ‘external dimension’ of empowerment. The external dimension of 
empowerment concerns everything which is not connected to an individual or a group’s 
understanding of their own entitlements and power as it exists in their life-situation. External 
dimensions which are important to strengthen women's empowerment and to increase their 
agricultural productivity have been appointed to; land ownership (Lastarria-Cornhiel, 
Behrman, Meinzen-Dick and Quisumbing in Quisumbing et al. 2014:117-144), the access to 
credit and savings (Fletschner and Kenney in Quisumbing et al. 2014:187-208), non-land 
agricultural inputs including technological, natural and human resources such as the 
implementation of mechanization, extension workers, seed varieties, inorganic fertilizer etc 
(Peterman, Behrman, Quisumbing in Quisumbing et al. 2014:145-186), group memberships 
and social networks (Meinzen-Dick, Behrman, Pandolfelli, Peterman, Quisumbing in 
Quisumbing et al. 2014:235-266). While this thesis will focus on the dimensions as 
mentioned above, ‘empowerment’ can also be conceptualized through its ‘internal 
dimensions.’ Internal empowerment has been discussed by both Batliwala and Kabeer as ‘the 
power within’, also conceptualized as ‘processes’ which engage people in making sense of 
their worlds, their relationships, their assumptions, beliefs, practices and values, and in 
questioning what they have come to take for granted, with potentially transformative effects 
(Cornwall and Edwards, 2014:6). Kabeer (1994:245-246) describes this as “strategies of 
empowerment from within providing women with new perspectives”, and as “new forms of 
consciousness arising out of women’s newly acquired access to the intangible resources of 
analytical skills, social networks, organizational strength, solidarity and sense of not being 
alone”. Batliwala generated an understanding of power as the control over material assets, 
intellectual resources, and ideology (Batliwala, 1994:129). Kabeer (Kabeer in SIDA, 
2001:19) refers to empowerment as ‘the expansion in people’s ability to make strategic life 
choices in a context where this ability was previously denied to them.’  

However, when discussing empowerment, it is important to highlight that it is a contested 
concept, criticized as one of the most loosely used terms in the development lexicon, meaning 
different things to different people or, more dangerously, all things to all people’ (Batliwala, 

14 

 

1994: 1). What is considered as empowerment for one woman in one specific context might 
be something entirely different for another woman in another context; thus, empowerment is 
context-specific (Cornwall and Edwards, 2014:17). There are also political disagreements as 
to the content and political application of the notion of ‘empowerment’ as a goal and strategy 
for women’s liberation (Fergusson, 2004). However, academics seem to agree on three 
statements on empowerment. These are that empowerment ; (1) is fundamentally about 
changing power relations, (2) is relational, in two senses as it both concerns relations of 
power in which people are located and the changing empowerment in one's relation to 
oneself, (3) it is a process (Cornwall and Edwards, 2014:7). Despite this, empowerment is 
neither a ‘linear process’ nor a ‘destination,’ meaning that a person who is empowered today 
might be disempowered tomorrow by changes in their circumstances (Tsikata and Darkwah, 
2014). Likewise, a person is not necessarily empowered in all aspects of its life at once. A 
person could be economically empowered but have some social disempowerment and vice 
versa (ibid.). Thus, social, economic, and political empowerment are not mutually exclusive 
(Eyben et al. 2008). Although both the internal and external dimensions of empowerment are 
essential in order to fully comprehend the concept, this thesis will mainly focus on the 
external dimension. Finally, it is the lack of women’s empowerment, which constitutes the 
gender gap in the agricultural sector. So by closing the gender gap, we can improve 
productivity and efficiency in agricultural production’ (Quisumbing et al. 2014; FAO, 2011). 

4.3 A-WEAI and operationalization 
To conceptualize women’s empowerment in agriculture, the thesis has been inspired by the 
analytical tool called the ‘Abbreviated- Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index’ (A-
WEAI) which was first developed in 2011 by USAID, the International Food Policy Research 
Institute, and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). A-WEAI aims 
to increase the understanding between women’s empowerment, food security and agricultural 
growth by measuring the roles and extent of women’s engagement in the agricultural sector’s 
five domains; ‘production- input in productive decisions’, ‘resources- ownership and access 
to productive assets’, ‘income- control of use of income’, ‘leadership- group membership’, 
‘time- workload’ (Alkire et al. 2013; Malapit et al. 2015:3, 2017; IFPRI, 2012). The A-WEAI 
stands out today as the only standardized tool to measure women’s empowerment and gender 
parity in the agricultural development sector (Alkire et al. 2013). It is a quantitative method 
for conducting large-scale surveys of female farmers impact in all areas of agriculture, and 
which incorporates econometric calculations, gender parity indexes, the measuring and 
categorization of results into the binary categories ‘empowered’ and ‘not empowered’ etc. 

While the A-WEAI has been utilized as the foundation in this thesis analytical framework, 
several adaptations have been made. First, the thesis has utilized questions with a time 
perspective of 5-10-years in addition to the preceding generation. This stands in contrast to 
the original version of the A-WEAI survey, which only asks about the present situation. To 
capture changes over time is vital in this thesis as it focuses on agricultural processes and 
developments. Second, the original A-WEAI domains have been somewhat simplified and 
changed. For example, to correlate with the thesis aim, domain no. 1 was added since no 
original A-WEAI specifically investigated the gendered differences in agricultural 
productivity levels. The five analytical domains which will be utilized in this thesis are; 1. 
Agricultural productivity, 2. Ownership or renting of resources, 3. Access and control of 

15 

 

income and credit, 4. Time and workload, and 5. Group membership. The purpose of the 
analytical domains is to function as indicators of the agricultural sector’s gender gap and as 
guiding principles for the data collection methods (presented in the methodology section). 
The five analytical domains will be utilized to answer the thesis three research questions in 
the following way. The first research question will be answered by the first domain, the 
second research question by the second to fifth domains, and the third research question 
through a more in-depth analysis of the effects of all five domains. This is illustrated in the 
model of the analytical framework below. 

Table 1: Analytical framework (inspired from the A-WEAI framework) 

 

5 Methodology 
This section will present the thesis methodology, beginning with the research design in the 
form of a mixed-methods approach guided by a positivist epistemology. This will be 
followed by the quantitative and qualitative methods, the sampling and deductive data 
analysis strategies, a short discussion on biases and ethical considerations, and end with a 
section on the thesis delimitations. 

5.1 Research design 
To answer the research questions and aim, this thesis has utilized a mixed methods-research 
design including both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (group and individual interviews), 
with both male and female farmers, in addition to participatory observation, and key 
informant interviews (Bryman, 2012:68; Nagy Hesse-Biber, 2014:366). The mixed-methods 
complement each other by combining fixed-choice and open-ended questions, allowing a 

16 

 

flexible, personal, and less hierarchical data collection device. In addition, it minimizes the 
risk of ‘reducing people to simple numbers’ and building oppressing power-structure 
relationships between the interviewer and respondent (Bryman, 2012:228; Nagy Hesse-Biber, 
2014:301-302; Sheyvens, 2014:253). Although this thesis does not have an explicit feminist 
theoretical foundation with emancipatory objectives, it has drawn inspiration from the 
feminist emphasis on using qualitative methods which are more compatible with gender 
sensitivity, women’s voices and emancipatory goals (Bryman, 2012:410-411). Looking to the 
research’s epistemological orientation, this is guided by a positivist approach including both 
deductive (the analytical framework called A-WEAI and its five domains) and inductive 
(connection to the theoretical concept of empowerment) elements (Bryman, 2012:26, 27). 
The ontological orientation is primarily guided by objectivism by viewing social reality as an 
external objective reality (Bryman, 2012:35,36). 

5.2 Quantitative methods and sampling- Survey 

5.2.1 Micro-survey with male and female farmers 
The data collection process was initiated by a small-scale survey (henceforth called the 
micro-survey), giving an overview of farmers status regarding the five analytical domains. 
The respondents were 18 male and female rice farmers, aged between 35-74 years old and 
married in both mono-, polygamous, male- and female-headed households. The micro-survey 
was designed as a structured interview, based on the A-WEAI framework incorporating 
fixed-choice questions which enabled respondents’ replies to be aggregated and measured 
(Bryman, 2012:210). Prior to the survey, key informant interviews, participant observations, 
and two pilot-surveys were conducted in order to ensure its’ quality and context-specific 
relevance. The time frame of the preceding 10 years was decided upon as many of the 
changes in female farming conditions started to emerge some 9 years ago and in addition, one 
of the female farmer association was created roughly 9 years ago. 

The survey was administered by the researcher, by reading the questions out loud to the 
respondents in a predetermined order upon which they answered by choosing from a fixed set 
of options. Consequences with researcher-administered surveys include respondents’ lack of 
being anonymous and researcher-respondent’s misunderstandings. However, reading the 
questions out loud was deemed necessary since most participants were analphabetic. The 
English version of the micro-survey questionnaire (the survey exists in both English and 
French versions), is to be found in the appendix section 9.1. There is also a compilation of the 
micro-survey respondents’ answers in the appendix section 9.5. 

5.3 Qualitative methods and sampling- Interviews and participant observation 

5.3.1 Individual and group interviews with male and female farmers 
Since the initial plan of conducting semi-structured group interviews with both male and 
females separately was not possible, male farmers were interviewed individually and female 
farmers in groups. The Oral History interviewing format was used as inspiration for both the 
individual and group interviews (Bryman, 2012:491). These included ‘interview guides’ 
asking the respondents to recall events from their past concerning rice agriculture, its 
gendered differences, female farmer’s role in agriculture over several generations as well as 
the mechanisms behind these developments. Both academic and key informants were 
consulted to make the questions in the ‘interview-guides’ relevant to both the local context 

17 

 

and the academic literature (Nagy Hesse-Biber, 2014:193; Smith, 2010; Rubin and Rubin, 
2012; Bryman, 2012:213, 465-482). The interview-guides can be found in the appendix 
sections 9.2- Female group interviews, 9.3- Male individual interviews in addition to 
appendix section 9.4- Summary of the data collection. Participants for the group interviews 
were selected according to the same sex, similar ages, and socio-economic situation, in order 
to avoid biases and to make everyone feel comfortable. The interviews complemented the 
micro-survey responses by collecting ‘unexpected’ answers, exploring new areas of limited 
knowledge, and to allow respondents to answer in their own terms (Nagy Hesse-Biber, 
2014:186; Bryman, 2012: 246-249).  

5.3.2 Interviews with key informants 
Key informant interviews were conducted throughout the fieldwork period. The key 
informants were working in or were highly knowledgeable on the Valley’s rice cultivation. 
They held professions such as; the regional officer of SAED, agronomy professor in the 
University of Gaston-Berger, consultant in agricultural development projects in the River 
Delta Valley, the president and secretary of FEPRODES, the president and extension worker 
of UFP-Ross Bethio and extension worker at ACSA (see the list of abbreviations on page 
vii). All of the key informant interviews assisted in the triangulation of the collected data as 
well as improving and adapting the designs of the other data collection methods, such as the 
micro-survey questionnaires and oral history interviews (Nagy Hesse-Biber, 2014:312). For a 
summary of the data collection, see the appendix section 9.4. 

5.3.3 Participant observation 
Participant observations were also conducted throughout the data collection process, meaning 
that the researcher immersed herself in a group for an extended period of time, observing 
behavior, listening to conversations, asking questions, gather further data through interviews 
and the collection of documents (Bryman, 2012:432). As the key informant interviews, this 
method was indispensable in the collection of background and contextual information and to 
complement and triangulate the above-mentioned data collection methods. Doing so can help 
to understand why survey-respondents answered the way they did and provide insight into the 
complexity of the local context. 

5.4 Sampling 
Overall, the sampling process, which was conducted until theoretical saturation, followed the 
typical case approach (Bryman, 2012:419,421), given the focus on villages and farmers who 
could provide a general idea of the area’s gender differences in rice cultivation. The strategies 
of Purposive and Convenience sampling have intermingled throughout the various stages in 
the research process. While purposive sampling implies to strategically choose cases or 
participants relevant to the research questions, convenience sampling simply designates what 
is available to the researcher (Bryman, 2012:201,418). The strategies were applied by 
searching for villages and farmers whose main occupation was rice cultivation. However, 
instead of a fully purposive sampling where the villages and farmers would have been chosen 
prior to the field-study, these were selected when in the field through convenience sampling 
since they were available to the researcher through the key informants (Bryman, 2012:418). 
While the survey participants were accessed, mainly by using convenience sampling, the 
interview participants were accessed by applying a more purposive sampling strategy as the 
answers from the surveys helped guiding the sampling process. For the interviews, the goal 

18 

 

was to find older farmers in order to ask questions about the preceding generation as this 
would make it easier to acquire relevant information concerning the research questions. It is 
important not to generalize the thesis analytical findings (Nagy Hesse-Biber, 2014:192). This 
is because of the inherently selective strategy of both purposive and convenience sampling, 
and since we do not know if the sample is representative for other villages and farmers in the 
region due to the small sample size.  

5.5 Data analysis 
The thesis data analysis procedure can be described as a deductive strategy implying that the 
interviews and surveys were coded and reviewed continuously throughout the data collection 
process making it easy to discover potential lack of data and to plan for the continued data 
collection. On the other hand, having pre-determined analytical categories or codes (the five 
domains of A-WEAI) easily excludes additional data to be observed. Triangulation was a 
major part of the data analysis process as the codes were revisited and connected to the 
theoretical framework and literature review. This allowed to theoretically reflect upon the 
analytical results and to make conclusions.  

5.6 Biases and ethical considerations 
This section will begin with a discussion on four important biases; thereafter, there will be a 
short discussion on ethical considerations such as researcher-respondent’s relationship and 
participant compensations. First, to account for seasonal biases, differences in factors of 
production, years of especially bad or good harvest, and gender gaps during the various 
seasons were discussed with the respondents according to which the survey and interview-
questions were adapted. Secondly, this cross-cultural empowerment research may have 
resulted in missing information when translating the concept of ‘empowerment.’ Measuring 
‘empowerment’ across cultural contexts is difficult since the concept has different meanings 
to the researcher and the respondents. The same factor can reflect empowerment in the eyes 
of the researcher but not to the respondent, and vice versa. Besides, there are risks of 
intrusion of normative indicators reflecting the researcher’s values rather than the 
respondents (Ohara and Clement, 2018). The triangulation of the various data collection 
methods helped to minimize the risk of this bias by better understanding what empowerment 
implies in the context of the River Delta Valley. Third, linguistic bias may have resulted in 
missing information since the researcher and respondents did not speak the same mother 
tongue but communicated in French with the help of translation. While professional 
interpreters proved difficult to find, key informants and individuals who had gone through 
high school were easily located and could, therefore, assist with translation. An issue with 
this was the lacking patience of one of the key informant’s when surveys took longer than 
expected. This was solved by conducting additional surveys with another key informant, and 
the triangulation of answers. Fourth, Oral History interviews are especially vulnerable to the 
intrusion of biases since respondents’ memories may be lacking (Bryman, 2012:491). To 
avoid this bias in this research looking at the past 10 years and the preceding generation, 
efforts were made to maximize the sample size, in addition to triangulating respondents’ 
answers with key informant interviews and background research.  

Continuing with ethical considerations in fieldwork studies, there are risks of an unbalanced 
researcher-respondent’s relationship (Bryman, 2012:39; Nagy Hesse-Biber, 2014:199). This 
is particularly relevant in this thesis due to its qualitative approach implementing participant 

19 

 

observation and in-depth interviewing. Answers may be influenced with what the respondent 
thinks the researcher wants to hear, or be constrained due to females many responsibilities, 
mistrust or low self-esteem, conflicting values or interests, loyalty to male 
community/household members or shame of their disadvantages (Sheyvens, 2014:193-
194,253). Knowledge of respondents’ perceptions and social status differences according to 
gender, race, ethnicity, class, culture, age, religion, language, and other factors will help to 
minimize researcher’s unawareness of biased answers (Matthews and Ross, 2010; Nagy 
Hesse-Biber, 2014:213, 215). Triangulation among the data collection methods, in addition to 
the provision of gifts after the surveys and interviews in preference of payments to 
participants, were done to minimize risks. In addition, the researcher took the stance of a 
‘friendly stranger’ by being polite, kind, showing interest in their lives and language, 
generous but upfront with the researcher’s limited resources, in order to keep a respectful 
researcher-respondents relationship (Sheyvens, 2014). To increase the sense of participants 
comfort and to comply with ethical considerations, participants were able to suggest the 
interview location, and discuss an information sheet regarding their informed consent etc (see 
the ‘introduction box’ in appendix sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.3) (Creswell, 2009; Padgett, 1998; 
Bryman, 2012:217-218). Naturally, all participants were above the age of 18. 

5.7 Delimitations  
As with all fieldworks and qualitative case studies in general, the generalizability and 
external validity of this thesis is highly limited due to its specific socio-political and 
geographical context (Bryman, 2012:69-70). An important limitation stems from the thesis 
aim, which is guided by the neoclassical economic objective of increasing agricultural 
productivity. This unavoidably limits the thesis theoretical perspective and analytical results. 
Another theoretical limitation of the thesis stems from its application of the complex and 
debated concept of ‘empowerment’ which can be defined and discussed in a multitude of 
ways. Since this thesis has adopted analytical domains from the A-WEAI framework, this 
unavoidably limits the thesis analysis to the ‘external dimensions’ of empowerment. In effect, 
the thesis will not cover the internal dimensions of empowerment such as patriarchal, sexist, 
capitalist, and neo-colonial structures of economic political and social domination. Therefore, 
the thesis will not analyze empowerment in its totality. 

6 Analytical results 
This section will both present and analytically discuss the data collection results drawing on 
the content of the literature review (section 3) and the analytical framework (section 4). It 
will do so in four sections, organized according to the research questions and under them the 
analytical domains from the A-WEAI framework. The first sub-section will give an overview 
of the setting of the data collection. The second sub-section will answer the first research 
question using the first analytical domain. The third sub-section will answer the second 
research question using the second to fifth analytical domains. Finally, the fourth sub-section 
will answer the third research question by analytically discuss all the five domains. 

Note: In sub-sections 2, 3 and 4, the information which describes the situation 5-10 years back in time was 
retrieved from the micro-survey while the information describing the previous generation was retrieved from the 
interviews. Information regarding the current situation was retrieved from both the micro-survey and the 
interviews.

6.1 The setting of data collection  
In the River Delta Valley, stretching 106 km from the cities of St Louis to Richard Toll 
(Devey, 2000), rice is cultivated for both domestic needs (food crop) and market sales (cash 
crop). Since most farmers now predominantly cultivate rice during the ‘Contre Saison Chaud’ 
season (January-March) as it is more profitable than the previous high season called 
‘Hivernage’ (May-July), the thesis has chosen to focus on the ‘Contre Saison Chaud.’ The 
data was collected from four different locations, including the three villages; Colonat, 
Souloul, Ndonba, and the small town of Ross Bethio, all of which are indicated on the map 
below. 

 

Figure 6: Map of locations of data collection. The map was retrieved from Google (2019) 

and adapted by the researcher 

While the village of Colonat has been characterized by rice cultivation since 1957, its two 
major issues are the limited access to both water and land. Water scarcity and farmers 
irrigation problems are due to low and irregular water levels in the nearby canal as it is 
owned by a massive sugar plantation which only fills up the canal a few times a month. Land 
scarcity is due to both soil salination (the accumulation of salt in the soil) and the increasing 
population. Both of these issues have consequences for female farmers whose only option is 
to help out on their husbands’ rice plots, as they lack their own land and women’s farming 
collectives is difficult to manage. In effect, this deprives the women of having their own 
economy and financial means (which cultivating their own plots would provide them with). 
While the village of Souloul is inhabited by the ethnic minority called Mhor who traditionally 
worked as herdsmen, the main occupation today is rice cultivation. Souloul has neither land 
nor water scarcity, and to irrigate the plots, it suffices to access a shared water pump which 
runs on gas. In addition, there are several female farming collectives. Like Souloul, the 
village of Ndonba has sufficient access to water, land, irrigation equipment and female 
farming collectives. Rice cultivation in Ndonba dates back some 20 years, while also 
engaging in more diversified agriculture in comparison to the other two villages. The small 
town of Ross Bethio is the center of the region’s rice production and the access to water, 

 

21 

land, irrigation equipment varies a great deal depending on the rice fields exact location. 
However, the city has a female farming collective.  

These four locations were chosen since both agricultural development projects, and two 
women’s farming collectives were present there. This provided insights into how female 
farmers’ rice productivity levels and agricultural management had been affected by becoming 
a member of a female farming collective. It also provided insight into differences in female 
farmers empowerment before and after being a member of a farmer’s collective. The first 
collective is called UGP-RB, situated in Ross Bethio and has 1 821 female members. It 
started with a microfinance activity in 1987 and were provided with plots from the 
Senegalese government through the Ross Bethio commune in 2009 (Key informant interview, 
Mme Gaye). The second collective is called FEPRODES, situated in the entire River Delta 
Valley and has 49 886 female members. Founded in 1997, FEPRODES has helped female 
farmers with financial support of agricultural inputs, and workshops on a range of subjects 
such as; rice farming techniques, financial management, leadership, formal legislation 
regarding land rights, and climate change, etc (Key informant interview, Mme Dieng 
Ndiaye).  

6.2 Gender differences in rice productivity levels 
This section answers the first research question regarding gender differences in agricultural 
productivity levels in the River Delta Valley. In doing so, the same questions were asked to 
both male and female participants. A compilation of the answers is found in the appendix 
section 9.5. 

6.2.1 Domain 1- Agricultural productivity 
While both similarities and differences were discovered according to the participating small-
scale farmers’ genders, we will begin with the similarities. The findings from the micro-
survey, including all four locations, indicated that both males and females had increased their 
rice production in comparison to the previous 10 years. While the preceding generation 
depended on subsistence farming and little market purchases, today, both male and female 
farmers apply high-intensive rice production techniques, including irrigation systems, better 
infrastructure, mechanized tools such as tillers, tractors, threshing machine, and harvest 
machines, pesticides, fertilizer, and improved seed varieties. Over the last 10 years, male and 
females have used the same inputs with the same quantity and frequency (see micro-survey 
results, points 1.5, and 1.6). The interviews found that the main factors determining the use of 
inputs were location, environmental, and financial factors, and not farmers’ gender per see. 
The micro-survey and in-depth interviews could not distinguish any gender differences in 
terms of soil qualities such as salinity, nutrient depletion, and drought (see micro-survey 
results, points 1.7). Instead, this was dependent on the particular village and specific plots. 
The results could not support that females were provided with particularly bad plots. During 
the interviews, both male and female respondents answered that rice cultivation had become 
more manageable in comparison to the preceding generation, who spent more time on the 
fields, and everything was done by hand, and nothing was mechanized.  

The productive factors which differentiate the genders in the Valley’s rice productivity can be 
summarized as; harvest quantity, area of production, number of laborers, and time of labor 
(see micro-survey results, points 1.1-1.4). The micro-survey concluded that males, in general, 

22 

 

produce more rice than their female counterparts due to the unequal gendered access to the 
factors of production; land, labor, and capital. Regarding land, while male respondents most 
commonly cultivated 2-5 ha, female respondents only cultivated 0.5-1 ha. This is displayed in 
the figure below. Even though many women had expanded their areas of rice cultivation over 
the last 10 years, men’s rice plots remained larger than those of females.

Figure 7: Participant farmers’ area of rice production 

Over the last 10 years, most male and female respondents estimated their harvest to be 
between 71-100 bags of rice per ha, depending on the year and environmental situation. 
However, among the rest of the female respondents, it seemed more common to harvest less 
than 50 bags of rice per ha, in comparison to male farmers who answered 51-70 bags per ha. 
The micro-survey observed one exception to males’ more abundant harvests with a married 
couple in the village of Ndonba. While both the husband and wife had cultivated 
approximately 3 ha over the last 10 years, the husband had harvested between 60-80 bags of 
rice per season and the wife between 60-100 bags of rice over the same period. 

Regarding the gendered differences of labor, the micro-survey found that females had less 
access to extension services and time of labor. While the men were able to spend their entire 
day on the fields, this was not the case for women who had many household obligations to 
take care of. According to the Oral history group interviews, females agricultural work is 
limited due to both their housework and the lack of energy as their bodies would get too tired. 
To cover their loss of working hours on the fields, female farmers would hire extensions 
workers. The need for extension workers has also increased due to the individualization and 
expansion of land plots, in opposition to the preceding generation. Extension services are 
always performed by private companies and their male staff who are paid by the smallholder 
farmer per day or per performed agricultural task. Since neither male nor female farmers have 
enough financial means to buy tillers, tractors, threshing machine, or harvest machines for 
their own plantations, they are obliged to hire extension services to complete labor-intensive 
tasks. 

23 

 

Recalling the literature review and the concept of ‘women’s double burden,’ the findings 
reflect this since women are obligated to perform both the housework and the remunerative 
agricultural work. Thus, female farmers in the River Delta Valley are negatively impacted by 
the prevailing gender gap in agriculture, decreasing their opportunities for productivity. This 
finding supports the thesis premise that to reach increased agricultural productivity; it is 
necessary to decrease the gender gap in the agricultural labor force  

6.3 Gender differences in agricultural management 
This section will answer the second research question, discussing gender differences in 
agricultural management. First, there will be a description of how the overall organization of 
rice agriculture in the River Delta Valley has developed from the previous generation until 
today. Secondly, there will be a description and an in-depth analysis of each analytical 
domain. 

The results from both female group-, male individual- and key informant interviews revealed 
that household’s agricultural plots had become individually instead managed of collectively. 
During the preceding generation, all household members worked on the family plot, resulting 
in one shared income, which was managed by the husband. This type of management is 
called the ‘co-operative model’ since resources are pooled, and harvests are shared instead of 
splitting up into several units amongst the family members. Today, the household’s husband 
and wife manage and cultivate their own plots individually. This type of management is 
called the ‘non-cooperative model’ since resources are not shared amongst family members, 
and the husband and the wife work separately on their respective fields which is their own 
responsibility (Quisumbing et al. 2014; Croppenstedth et al. 2013; Udry et al. 1995; Udry, 
1996; Goldstein and Udry, 2008; Diiro et al. 2018). Recalling Section 3.2. in the literature 
review, the preceding generation’s agricultural management fit into the tenant of ‘Pareto 
efficiency.’ This assumes that farming households would share the factors of production in an 
equal distribution (the co-operative model), making it more likely to maximize agricultural 
efficiency. In the current individualized management system, this is not the case. To 
exemplify this, one of the female farmers from one of the oral history group interviews said 
the following. 

“The husbands give nothing to their wives. The wives do not even know how much rice 
their husbands are harvesting and what they do with their revenues. The husbands only 

“give” to their wives during the night.” 

(Female farmer from Oral history group interview no. 2, in Ross Bethio) 

6.3.1 Domain 2- Ownership or renting of resources 
The thesis has observed both similarities and differences in genders ownership or renting of 
productive factors such as land and resources, over the last 10 years and preceding 
generation. 

Starting with the similarities between the genders regarding the owning or renting of 
resources. Neither male nor female farmers can afford to buy farming equipment such as 
tractor, transportation, tools, plow, tiller or irrigation system, which is therefore rented by all 
farmers (see micro-survey results, point 2.4). Despite this, one exception was noted from a 
female farmer in the Souloul village as her female farmer collective had previously owned a 
tractor. However, most farmers cannot afford collective ownership either. Continuing with 

24 

 

the differences between the genders in regard to the owning or renting of resources. The 
micro-survey showed that over the previous 10 years, men had owned their plots to a larger 
extent than females, meaning that females more often had to rent their land of rice production 
(see micro-survey results, point 2.2). This is displayed in the figure below.

Figure 8: Participant farmers' ownership and renting of rice plots 

Part of this issue can be appointed to the rules regarding inheritance since females rarely have 
the opportunity to inherit land from their parents or another relative, whereas men do (see 
micro-survey results, point 2.5). Even though females and males have equal rights to land and 
inheritance according to Senegal’s official legislation, this right is often not enforced due to 
pertaining Senegalese traditions which only allows men to inherit land. The micro-survey 
revealed that among the respondents, 2 out of 11 female farmers in comparison to 4 out of 7 
male farmers had inherited land. However, the female group and key informant interviews 
revealed that while some women today do inherit land, this remains rare. In addition, when 
females do inherit land, the plots are much smaller than those that men get to inherit. While 
females restricted access to land dates back to previous generations, it has gotten somewhat 
better.  

The gender difference regarding land access supports previous research made by IPAR and 
RTI International (2018) in the River Delta Valley, stating that female farmers limited land 
access is a major constraint to their agricultural productivity. Another previous study by 
Grigsby (2004), contains both supportive and contradictory findings in comparison to this 
thesis. The supportive findings include that; (1) women today have greater economic 
autonomy than the preceding generation, (2) women’s access to important commons 
resources was a function of prevailing land use rather than any structure of tenure rights, (3) 
farmers have an increasing need for cash which has placed a greater emphasis on non-farm 
sources of income. The contradictory findings include that; tenure formalization and the 
‘individualization’ of land, including greater equity in terms of statutory land rights, often 
had adverse effects on women’s rights in agriculture. Grigsby listed several reasons for this 
including that; land-rights institutions are more accessible to men who have personal contacts 
and capital, and that women, in general, have insufficient levels of literacy and less 

25 

 

administrative knowledge. Continuing, women have fewer personal contacts with local 
officials, fewer opportunities to use transportation systems and vehicles, less income to settle 
bribes or pay for travel and lodging, and less traditional rights. He also found that women 
could use the land, but not control it or manage its resources, and they were also subject to 
eviction and relegated to less fertile areas. While all of these reasons could not be controlled 
for in this thesis, it was found that the ‘individualization’ of land had rendered in several 
females expanded economy. Thus, Grigsby’s conclusion could not be supported. To 
conclude, Senegal’s gendered land distribution results in the fact that women have less 
capability to produce as much rice as men, due to their restricted financial capacities. 
Females’ weaker economic position in comparison to men contributes to their economic 
marginalization and disempowerment.  

6.3.2 Domain 3- Access and control of income and credit 
Moving on to the third analytical domain, there are several gender differences in farmers 
access and control of income and credit. Overall, while both male and females have low 
incomes, and limited opportunities to borrow money, they all hold individual control of the 
income and credit that they acquire.  

Looking at the opportunities of borrowing money for their agricultural production, the micro-
survey and in-depth interviews revealed that while women had equal rights to borrow money, 
their limited finances prevented them from doing so. Over the last 10 years, both genders had 
borrowed money from a variety of actors in order to conduct their rice production as this was 
necessary to cover all their costs (see micro-survey results, point 3.4). Males tended to 
borrow money from the bank, while females were more prone to borrow money from family 
and friends. While it was difficult for women to borrow from the bank since they cultivated 
too small plots to make it profitable enough, most banks actually preferred lending money to 
females (as long as they have sufficient financial security) since males rarely paid off their 
depths (according to both male and female interviews). Regarding decision-making, both 
males and females had individual control over the money that they borrowed (see micro-
survey results, point 3.5). 

Looking at the premises of decision-making in the River Delta Valley, this has evolved 
significantly from the preceding generation. Today, both males and females make their own 
agricultural and financial decisions concerning their individual plots, as they are their 
business alone (see micro-survey results, point 3.1-3.3). While decisions on a general basis 
are made individually, one of the micro-survey female respondents in the Colonat village 
diverted from this as all decisions regarding both the household and agriculture were taken 
collectively between her and her co-wives. In contrast, during the preceding generation, all 
decisions were taken by the husband. While females’ responsibilities revolved around the 
housework and family plots, males’ responsibilities covered all financial costs of the 
household, and work and decision-making on the family plots (according to several key 
informant and female group interviews). The husband had the authority over all productive 
resources and the financial responsibility concerning all costs related to the household 
expenditures. The wife did not have any financial or decision-making responsibilities since 
she was not considered knowledgeable enough and no personal income.  

The thesis findings are both supporting and contradictory to the previous research on the 
same topic. In the study by IPAR and RTI International (2018), it was found that female 

26 

 

farmers in the River Delta Valley lack the opportunity to participate in household decisions 
regarding agricultural production. This finding is supported by this thesis when looking to the 
preceding generation’s ‘one family plot’ agricultural organization as females during that time 
had no power in household decisions. However, when looking to the current individualized 
agricultural organization, the IPAR and RTI International’s findings are not supported by this 
thesis as women have sole decision-making power over their own rice plots. In this sense, 
female farmers today are very empowered. Looking at the economic aspect, despite females 
having fewer financial means than males, males also have economic issues. First of all, it has 
become more problematic for males to borrow money from banks and in addition, NGO’s 
and organizations tend to favor supporting women instead of males since females, in general, 
are more economically disempowered than males. Therefore, in comparison to the study by 
IPAR and RTI International (2018) which found that female farmers had inadequate access to 
and management of agricultural credit, the thesis results are both supportive and conflictual. 

The thesis findings support the claim that when females are provided with the opportunity to 
manage financial assets, the whole family, and in particular, the children benefit. This stands 
in stark contrast to when males manage the financial assets as it is more often spent on the 
male’s personal interest (Quisumbing, 2003:11,13). The data retrieved from the female 
group, key informant and participant observations mainly collected from the town of Ross 
Bethio and the village Colonat suggested that when the developments from the rice 
agriculture resulted in extra income for female farmers they would use the money to invest in 
their children’s education, build or renovate the house, or expand their businesses. When 
asked about their husband, all interviewed women both in group and individually responded 
that their husbands would probably contribute to some household costs but that he would 
prioritize his own need such as taking another wife for example (writer’s note: males in 
Senegal has the right to marry up to four women). When the males were asked about this 
reply, the subject of marrying another wife was not mentioned. However, when verified and 
triangulated with information from several of the key informants and informal conversations, 
the male practice of taking another wife when the finances allow doing so is a standard 
practice with social and religious support in the entire country. When males were asked the 
same question, they answered that they would prioritize the needs of the household such as 
adding more food, paying for children’s school and clothes, etc. When asked about their 
wives, they stated that they would also prioritize the household needs, just like themselves. 

6.3.3 Domain 4- Time and workload 
The fourth analytical domain regarding time allocation and workload, revealed significant 
gender differences since an individual’s gender decides what work and for how long time this 
is to be done. Looking at female’s workload, the individual, group and key informant 
interviews revealed that while domestic work is only performed by women, the extent and 
types of activities seemed to be decided by their age, social status and role in the household. 
For example, cleaning tends to be done by the older children and young wives, whereas the 
feeding of the younger children seems to a larger extent be done by older women. At the age 
of retirement, both men and women tend to work less in general. However, in the case of 
women, this depends on how many younger female household members are available to 
replace them and the work that they would typically do. Thus, at the time of retirement 
(approximately from the age of 70), the division of labor both in terms of income generation 

27 

 

and domestic activities seem to a larger extent fall on the responsibility of women. While 
older men spend most of their time at the mosque, with friends or resting, their wives were 
left with both the financial and domestic responsibility of the household. The situation can 
quickly become dire if the retired couple has no children or grandchildren who can care for 
them. Looking at this situation from an empowerment perspective, this can be slightly 
conflictual as retired women, on the one hand, are economically empowered, but on the other 
hand, are disempowered in terms of time. This is because women are left with the 
responsibility to make ends meet for the household’s needs. It can be concluded that the 
concept of ‘women’s double burden’ (Hochschild and Machung, 1990), generally applies in 
the context of rice agriculture in the River Delta Valley. While men’s responsibility remains 
to provide rice and finances for the family until the age of retirement, women engage in the 
same tasks, in addition to taking care of the household and children, even after the age of 
retirement. Women’s double burden is a major obstacle to increasing their agricultural 
productivity. This finding stands in contrast to IPAR and RTI International’s study (2018), 
which found that workload is not a major constraint to female farmers empowerment, though 
it had a greater burden on women in the rainy season when agricultural activities are more 
time-consuming. 

Looking at gender differences in time allocation, the results from the micro-survey, 
concluded that middle-aged men spend most of their time on their rice fields although this 
was sometimes combined with other economic activities such as growing other crops both for 
domestic consumption and market sales as well as fishing. The results looking at females’ 
time allocation varied a lot more as certain spent most of their time on the local market, 
vending various produce, whereas others spent most of their time in the fields. In general, 
women seemed more prone than men to engage in several economic activities, combining 
rice and other crops cultivation and market sales (see micro-survey results, point 4.1). This is 
displayed in the figure below.

Figure 9: Participant farmers' main activity on a daily basis 

In a sense, this disputes the analytical results from Smith and Chavas (1997) who found that 
the commercialization of agricultural productions in West African households was typically 

28 

 

done by increasing the production on male managed communal lands, meaning that husbands 
controlled the increased income. This is not the case for the participants in this study as 
women were more prone than men to engage in commercial activities. Due to the households 
‘non-co-operative model’ in which husbands and wives do not share their incomes, women’s 
increased revenues were not controlled by their husbands. Thus, the commercialization of 
agricultural productions had, in fact, a positive effect on women’s empowerment. However, it 
is true that the land in the Valley which is managed by males is a lot larger than that of 
females, meaning that males have larger possibilities and economic benefits to reap from 
expanded commercialization of their production. 

Looking at the gender’s workload and tasks within agriculture, this has evolved from the 
preceding generation until today. During the preceding generation, women’s agricultural 
work covered tasks such as seeding, weeding, threshing and harvesting. Male tasks included 
soil and plots preparation, plants breeding ground, surveillance of the fields to avoid the loss 
of crops to feeding wild animals, transportations, physical and heavy tasks, in addition to 
threshing and harvesting which was conducted by the entire family (key informants and in-
depth interviews). Today, many of the gendered work tasks from the preceding generation 
remain the same, although this division is becoming more and more blurred as both males 
and females now have their individual plots which each person manages by themselves. The 
interviews found that the current division of agricultural tasks including the handling of 
machines and technical equipment is generally done by males. These include pesticide and 
herbicide treatment, which traditionally was done by hand by women and without chemicals. 
This finding is interesting to compare to the previous study by Braun and Webb (1989) who 
found that when agricultural tools and techniques are introduced in the production process, 
this transfers the crop from being a “female crop” to a “male crop.” In support of Braun and 
Webb, one may argue that the nowadays mechanized tasks in rice cultivation are primarily 
assigned to male extension workers, handling the machines such as tillers, tractors, threshing 
machine, harvest machine, etc. Thus, the technologization of either a part of an agricultural 
process or the entire production process of a specific crop may cause the process to become a 
domain only for males. However, it is unfair to say that the mechanization of rice production 
in the River Delta Valley has a disempowering effect on female farmers since it has many 
benefits for them. In addition, rice production in the Valley has not transferred rice-crops 
from the female to the male domain. On the contrary, female farmers produce much more 
rice than before. In fact, the mechanized rice cultivation has provided women with the 
opportunity to create their own finances, resulting in economic empowerment. Therefore, the 
findings from Braun and Webb (1989), cannot be entirely supported by this thesis. 

6.3.4 Domain 5- Group membership 
Looking to the fifth and final analytical domain regarding group membership, all female 
respondents were part of one of the farmers collective; FEPRODES or UGP-RB, which 
provided them with approximately 0.5 ha per individual. Most of the women had joined the 
farmers collective about 10 years previously. During the group interviews, female 
respondents answered that being part of a female farmers association had improved their lives 
in a variety of ways. It had allowed them to expand their rice production since they now had 
the opportunity to borrow money through microfinance activities in the farmers collective 
(although borrowing money from family and friends remained more common). The farmers 

29 

 

collective had provided them with economic support as it financed their agricultural inputs 
and the power to decide upon purchases. Thus, being part of a farmer’s collective gave 
females economic empowerment (external form of empowerment). In addition, the farmer’s 
collective had provided female farmers with training and workshops of various types. To the 
question of whether male or female farmers were the most knowledgeable rice producers one 
female answered that; 

“Our husbands are more knowledgeable since they started with rice production before 
us, but with the farmers collective and the workshops they hold, we have gotten more 

knowledgeable than before.” 

(Female farmer from Oral history group interview no. 2, in Ross Bethio) 

Female respondents also answered that the farmer’s collective had given them moral support, 
close friends, extra motivation, and encouragement. Another female farmer said that; 

“Being part of the female farmers collective has given me a second family.” 

(Female farmer from Oral history group interview no. 5, in Ross Bethio) 

Thus, being part of a farmer’s collective gave females internal empowerment since the 
collective helped to change the female’s mindset to what they were capable of doing. In 
comparison, the male respondents were not part of any farmers collective. While most of the 
men were positive to the fact that their wives had financial support for their agricultural 
production, several of them questioned why they could not get the same financial support. 

The thesis results stand in contrast to previous research from IPAR and RTI International 
(2018), who found that female farmers had a lack of involvement in community groups. 
However, since this thesis selectively has chosen women who are members of a female 
farmers collective, this finding cannot be considered as representative for this region.  

6.4 Female farmers socio-economic situation as a result of agricultural 
developments 
The past agricultural developments in the River Delta Valley has had many and various 
impacts upon female farmers in the region. Looking at the socio-economic situation, rice 
production in the River Delta Valley today is more profitable both for male and females as a 
result of the agricultural intensification. However, the high-intensive form of agriculture 
demands significant investments since inputs are costly. When asked whether they thought 
they were economically better off today than 10 years previously, both male and female 
respondents from all four data collection locations were quite unsure. Most respondents 
answered that although they now had a more substantial income from their rice production, 
their agricultural expenses had increased significantly as well. So ultimately, they were left 
with close to nothing at the end of the day. 

Looking at female farmers economic situation in general, they have less capital than males, 
which is due to several factors. First, females cannot work as many hours as men on the rice 
fields due to the housework they are assigned to do. Second, since females do not have 
enough time to work on their rice fields, they need to hire extension workers to perform the 
tasks they cannot do themselves. Third, women cultivate less ha than male farmers. This 
results in higher farming expenditures for women than men. When situating these three issues 

30 

 

in the socio-economic context of Senegal, it should be highlighted that they are mere results 
from underlying disempowering social structures and institutions which have economically 
disempowering effects for females. Some of these are the unequal practice of inheritance, 
engrained patriarchal systems, limiting norms about what each gender should be engaged in 
doing, etc.  

The group interviews found that female farmers today take a larger economic responsibility 
for household expenses, in comparison to the preceding generation when all costs had been 
covered by the husband. In addition to females’ traditional responsibilities of housework and 
children, they now also cover the financial costs related to these housework tasks. For 
example, paying for children’s clothes, school fees, detergent, certain foods, etc is now 
generally the females’ financial responsibility. While females of the preceding generation had 
no individual money, they now manage and cultivate their individual plots enabling them to 
have their own economies. Today, Senegalese households tend to have split economies in 
comparison to the preceding generation, which had one shared economy governed by the 
husband and utilized to cover the household’s expenditures. The family plots cover family 
needs and expenditures while governed by the husbands. The husbands have the primary 
responsibility and power in household-decisions; however, they do not have any 
responsibility for domestic work or the children-related financial costs and work. Thus, while 
women’s domestic and children-related work has remained the same in comparison to the 
preceding generation, they now have a larger financial responsibility. Simultaneously, men’s 
work has remained more or less constant while their financial responsibility has decreased. 
The reason for the transfer of the financial responsibility from the husband to the wife can be 
connected to several explanations. During the Oral history group interview no 3, it was said 
that the reason to why females had started to cultivate individual plots for rice production was 
because of the ever-increasing droughts which meant that the harvest was bad and thus they 
started cultivating their own plots in order to help cover the family needs. The transfer of the 
financial responsibilities from the husband to the wife can also be connected to women’s 
expanded economic liberty as they nowadays manage their own individual income. These 
findings support the previous research by Doss (2001), stating that African households are 
complex and heterogeneous, and gender roles are not static but change in response to new 
economic opportunities. In the case of the River Delta Valley, it is a combination of external 
impacts and new economic opportunities which have rendered in changes in the gendered 
division of labor and responsibilities. 

Among the interviewed households, it was common to divide the rice production into three 
parts; female plots, male plots and family plots. The revenues from females’ individual plots 
cover the household needs and expenditures. In comparison, the revenues from males’ 
individual plots would also cover parts of the household needs and expenditures in addition to 
males’ personal needs. This, although male plots tend to be larger than those of women. To 
reflect this, one female farmer stated that; 

“Our husbands put their money in their pockets. They divide their income into three 

parts; one part for their personal needs, one part of marrying a second wife and another 
part to marry a third wife. It is, therefore, up to us the wives to care for the household’s 

needs.”  

(Female farmer from Oral history group interview no. 2, in Ross Bethio) 

31 

 

The current division of financial responsibilities and household work has put a more 
substantial burden on women compared to the preceding generation. This provides a clear 
example of women’s double burden where Senegalese wives are in constant lack of financial 
resources and time in opposition to their husbands. This suggests that although some of the 
external dimensions of empowerment which are part of the A-WEAI analytical framework 
shows that female farmers have become more empowered today in comparison to the 
previous 10 years and preceding generation, the situation seems more complicated than that. 
This is especially apparent when looking at the limited access to land as women have smaller 
plots sizes than men (domain 2), limited opportunities to inherit land as women seldom own 
their land of production (domain 2), women’s limited finances (domain 3), and women’s 
heavier workload and limited time in comparison to men (domain 4). When looking at these 
domains, it is clear that female farmers socio-economic situations are different from those of 
males. In conclusion, the previous developments in the River Delta Valley’s rice cultivation 
have had significant differences in both genders, leaving females with more limited 
opportunities in agricultural productivity than males. 

6.5 Theoretical reflections 

6.5.1 Agricultural transformation and the smallholder-based approach 
While Senegal’s economic development as outlined in the background section through the 
figures 4 and 5, initially suggests that the Agricultural Transformation (according to Timmer, 
1998) has been initiated, a more in-depth analysis reveals that this is not the case. As 
mentioned in that section, the productivity of Senegal’s agricultural sector has not increased 
but remained low since the main driver to Senegal’s agricultural growth is input 
intensification and not increasing productivity (The World Bank, 2018:27). While 
agricultural transformations are characterized by an intensification of grain production, 
commercial diversification from grains into non-staple crops and income diversification out 
of agriculture into the non-farm economy leading to increasing land and labor productivity 
etc (Andersson-Djurfeldt et al. 2018:3), this evolutionary agricultural process seems to be 
lacking in Senegal and the River Delta Valley. 

The previous decade's agricultural developments in the region have not only resulted in 
highly intensive farming for smallholders but also the installation of large-scale 
agribusinesses. Previous research on foreign investments in agribusinesses in the River Delta 
Valley has highlighted both its’ positive and negative effects on smallholders. On the positive 
side, agribusinesses can create welfare impacts through employment creation and labor 
market participation, resulting in higher household income leading to reduced poverty and 
inequality, especially for the previously poorest households (Van den Broeck et al. 2017; Van 
den Broeck and Maertens, 2017; Maertens et al. 2011). On the negative side, foreign-
financed investments in dams and irrigation schemes in conjunction with Northern-influenced 
(or imposed) policies have had severe adverse effects on the livelihoods and welfare of 
family farmers, fishers, and pastoralists in the Senegal River Valley (Koopman, 2009). The 
importation of food crops can weaken the region’s food security by driving down local 
producers’ prices and incentives for production, causing severe consequences in the event of 
spiking global food prices, as it did in 2008 (Koopman, 2009). In this thesis, key informant 
interviews, group and individual interviews, as well as participant observations, also found 
diverging effects of agribusiness investments onto the smallholder participants. On the 

32 

 

positive side, the agribusinesses provided the surrounding communities with employment 
opportunities (although only temporary), transferring workers from the informal to the formal 
employment sector. On the negative side, many of the agribusinesses do not supply the local 
market as the products are shipped to Europe, some resources such as land became more 
difficult for smallholders to access, and many smallholders found it challenging to make their 
voices heard in comparison to the agribusinesses. The collected data could not support any 
specific gender differences in terms of agribusinesses consequences onto smallholder 
farmers. 

6.5.2 Females empowerment 
Recalling the analytical findings in section 6.4, it was found that many of the household’s 
economic responsibilities had been transferred from males to females when comparing 
female farmers socio-economic situation today in comparison to the preceding generation. 
When situating this finding into an empowerment analytical perspective, one can argue that 
female farmers in the River Delta Valley today, are both more and less empowered. The 
factors indicating that female farmers are more empowered are, group membership and 
females’ individual economies, which have strengthened female farmers ‘internal dimension’ 
of empowerment. The following statement was supported by the thesis findings 
“empowerment involves shifts in the way in which we perceive the world and our place 
within it (…) it expands our horizons of possibility and shifts our consciousness, making 
other kinds of changes possible” (Cornwall and Edwards, 2014:xi). The group interviews 
revealed that females saw a clear difference between themselves and the preceding 
generation, as they had much more power over their lives, larger capabilities to create and 
expand their businesses and were less dependent on their husbands. This contrasted to the 
preceding generation whose females were considered as submissive, powerless, and without 
much knowledge or capabilities to create new opportunities in their lives. These opinions 
were shared with the responses from the individual male interviews. In this sense, female 
farmers had a somewhat empowered consciousness about themselves and their roles in both 
agricultural development and their life situation at large. Through the female farmers' 
associations, they shared different forms of collective action, activism for their rights and 
gave mutual support for individual struggles. The factor is indicating that female farmers are 
equally as disempowered today as the preceding generation is the patriarchal structure, which 
still remains as males hold the most power in decision-making. Women’s decision-making 
power is mostly limited to her own agricultural plot and not household decisions. To increase 
empowerment, it is vital to initiate a structural change in favor of greater equality (Batliwala, 
1994; Kabeer,1994; Kabeer in SIDA, 2001). Unfortunately, this has not happened in the 
River Delta Valley, since more or less the same power-relation between males and females 
still exist.  

However, in support of the thesis theoretical framework, it can be concluded that 
empowerment is a highly dynamic process since “a person is not necessarily empowered in 
all aspects of its life at once” (Tsikata and Darkwah, 2014). The thesis revealed that while the 
gender differences in some of the analytical domains were large (ie; domains 2, 3 and 4), they 
were nearly absent in other domains (ie; domain 1). In addition, a person who is empowered 
today might be disempowered tomorrow by changes in their circumstances and vice versa 
(Tsikata and Darkwah, 2014). This is especially relevant for people living on subsistence 

33 

 

farming, just like many of the thesis respondents do since small changes from one day to 
another can have terrible consequences. Also, some developments might result in increased 
empowerment in one domain but disempowerment in another. An example of this can be 
observed in the relationship between the domains 3 and 4 where females overall larger access 
and decision-making over capital has not resulted in them having more money to spend on 
themselves or more time, but the opposite (see section 6.4.).  

7 Conclusion 
This thesis aimed to explore the gendered differences between male and female farmers’ 
smallholder rice production and its impact upon agricultural productivity, management, and 
female farmers’ socio-economic situation, in the River Delta Valley in Senegal. This is 
important since previous research has shown that agricultural productivity levels have been 
hampered due to female farmers marginalization and lack of opportunities in the agricultural 
sector. The solution to this issue has been appointed to increasing female farmers 
empowerment. To investigate females empowerment in the case of rice cultivation in the 
River Delta Valley, the thesis theoretical framework was based on Timmer’s model of the 
Agricultural Transformation, pro-poor agricultural growth, and the concept of empowerment, 
which was operationalized through the analytical framework called the ‘Women’s 
Empowerment in Agriculture Index’ (A-WEAI). This consisted of five analytical domains; 1. 
Agricultural productivity, 2. Ownership or renting of resources, 3. Access and control of 
income and credit, 4. Time and workload, and 5. Group membership, which was used to 
locate gender gaps and to guide the data collection process. The data collection applied a 
mixed-methods approach involving a micro-survey, individual and group interviews and 
participating observations with both male and female farmers. To fulfill the aim of the thesis, 
this was divided into the following three research questions. 

The first question asking about gender differences in productivity levels found both 
differences and similarities between male and female farmers. The similarities included high-
intensive rice production techniques, applied by both male and female farmers. The 
differences included the area of production, number of laborers, and time of labor, resulting 
in more abundant harvests for males in comparison to females. Contextualized to the model 
of Timmer’s Agricultural Transformation, these findings are positive since both genders have 
increased their rice production through high-intensive agriculture while both the labor force 
and GDP has increased in the service sector. However, when discussed with the help of 
previous research, Senegal is not on the path of the Agricultural Transformation, partly due to 
input intensification instead of increasing productivity as the main driver to Senegal’s 
agricultural growth.  

The second question asking about gender differences in agricultural management also found 
both similarities and differences depending on the analytical domain. The major gender 
differences in agricultural management were the limited access to land as women have 
smaller plots sizes than men (domain 2), limited opportunities to inherit land as women 
seldom own their land of production (domain 2), women’s limited finances (domain 3), 
women’s heavier workload and limited time in comparison to men (domain 4) and women’s 
membership in farmers’ collectives (domain 5). The similarities in agricultural management 

34 

 

among the genders included the use of intensified agricultural techniques and inputs such as 
fertilizer, machines, pesticides, etc (domain 1 and 2). Although many gender differences 
remain within the rice production in the River Delta Valley, today female farmers produce 
much more rice than they did only 5-10 years ago or even in the preceding generation when 
they worked for their husbands. This is because women now cultivate their own individual 
plots over which they have decision-making power, their own economy, access to credit, in 
addition to organizing themselves into farming collectives including microfinance. These 
findings revealed that female farmers in the River Delta Valley today are both more and less 
empowered, depending on which analytical domain one analyzes and how it is analyzed. The 
factors indicating female’s empowerment are group memberships in farming collectives, 
females’ decision-making power over their own rice plantations and their individual 
economies, by strengthening both the ‘external’ and the ‘internal’ dimensions of 
empowerment. On the other side, the factors indicating female’s lesser empowerment are 
their marginalized rights concerning inheritance and ownership of land, constraints in time 
and workload, and limited financial resources in comparison to male farmers. 

The third question asking about the previous rice agriculture developments’ effects on female 
farmers’ socio-economic situation, found that women’s increased income had transferred 
financial responsibilities within household’s, from the husband to the wife. This had resulted 
in a more substantial financial burden for women today in comparison to the preceding 
generation. Therefore, women’s increased economic empowerment had brought with it a 
more substantial ‘double burden’ for the women as both their domestic and professional 
responsibilities had increased due to their expanded financial freedom. This finding serves as 
an example of the complexity of empowerment, since estimating the level of female farmers 
empowerment is not as clear cut as we might think. Therefore, this finding confirmed what 
was stated in the theoretical framework, being that female empowerment is not a linear 
process as the improvement in one aspect might result in negative consequences in another. 

Part of the thesis findings was that, in opposition to men, female farmers extra incomes were 
invested in their children’s education, build or renovate the house, or expand their businesses. 
This confirms the previous research from Quisumbing, (2003), discussed in the literature 
review, which stated that when females (in opposition to males) are provided with the 
opportunity to manage financial assets, the whole family and in particular the children 
benefit. Another finding which refuted previous research was that the female participants 
seemed more prone than men to engage in several economic activities, including market 
sales. Due to the households ‘non-co-operative model’ in which husbands and wives do not 
share their incomes, women’s increased revenues were not controlled by their husbands. 
Thus, women’s commercialization of agricultural productions had, in fact, a positive effect 
on their empowerment. In a sense, this disputes the analytical results from Smith and Chavas 
(1997) who found that the commercialization of agricultural productions in West African 
households was typically done by increasing the production on male managed communal 
lands, meaning that husbands controlled the increased income. 

The persisting gender gap among rice farmers in the River Delta Valley can be traced to the 
patriarchal structures, appointing the elderly males as the person in charge of the household’s 
decision-making. This stands in contrast to women’s decision-making power, which is mostly 
limited to her own agricultural plot and individual economy, and not the household and 

35 

 

family decisions. Thus, more or less the same gendered power-structure from the preceding 
generation still exist today, meaning that women’s individual rice cultivation rendering in 
their own economy has not been able to alter patriarchal social structures. In order for female 
farmers to be more empowered and to close the gender gap, these patriarchal structures need 
to change. This can be framed through Batliwala’s definition of empowerment as “the 
process of challenging existing power relations, and of gaining greater control over the 
sources of power” (Batliwala, 1994:130). In effect, the persistent gender gap in Senegal’s 
agricultural sector will continue to impose consequences for the Senegalese government’s 
goal of reaching rice self-sufficiency and its overall developmental path. In addition, it is 
unclear how large-scale agribusiness will affect smallholder’s possibilities of reaching 
agricultural growth and gender equality in agricultural management. 

A suggestion for future research on this topic is to investigate how the smallholder-based 
agricultural growth, in opposition to the large-scale farming approach differs in terms of 
female empowerment potentials. For example, what indications can be found in the River 
Delta Valley, supporting that the smallholder-based, in comparison to the large-scale farming 
approach, have positive effects on female farmers empowerment? Another suggestion is to 
investigate whether the trend of transferring economic responsibilities from male to females 
will continue in correlation with females increased individual economies. If this trend does 
continue, what responsibilities will be transferred to women? Will they only end up with the 
household’s economic responsibilities, or may this also lead to female’s increasing decision-
making power? Ultimately, the question remains whether females increased economic 
empowerment in the form of individual economies hold the potential to decrease the gender 
gap and assist in taking Senegal forward on the developmental path.

Do you think that males are more productive and efficient rice farmers than 
females? For example; do males hire more extension workers, use more machines 
and inputs, etc? Has this changed over time? 

Do you think that males are more talented at rice farming than females? Also, do 
you and your husband share your knowledge on rice agriculture and has this 
changed over time? 

How have your lives changed after becoming a member of the female farming 
association (FEPRODES, UFP-Ross Bethio)? For example, rice production and 
economy. 

If you would have a much larger harvest, how would you spend your additional 
income? In comparison, if it would have been your husband who would have had 
a larger harvest, what would he have done with the additional income?

Note: the number of male and female survey respondents are not the same. Female respondents were 11 while 
the male respondents were only 7. In addition, some answers for specific years are inconclusive as respondents 
could not always answer the question asked due to bad memory and for not farming rice during the particular 
year which was asked for.

How many laborers work on this land during the less labor-intensive season?  

Note: extension workers are always hired for harvest and other labor-intensive seasons, thus asking 
about the less labor-intensive season indicates how high the workload is on the individual of an 
everyday basis. In addition, all respondents answering this question had different sizes of plots.
