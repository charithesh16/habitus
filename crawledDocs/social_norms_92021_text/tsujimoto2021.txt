Increasing temperatures and water scarcity are concomitant threats to sustainable rice production in future 
climates. Although both aspects have been widely studied, little is understood about how water-saving man-
agement might affect heat-induced stress and grain yield of rice under open-field conditions. The objective was to 
clarify how water management practices affect daily inner-canopy temperature (Tc) dynamics, flowering time, 
heat-induced spikelet sterility, and rice grain yield. Field experiments were conducted in four consecutive wet 
and dry seasons in northern Ghana. Two rice varieties, IR64 and Jasmine85, were grown under two water re-
gimes: 1) continuous flooding (FL), and 2) continuous flooding except for an approximately 20-day drainage 
treatment at the flowering period (DF). Although the DF treatment was non-flooded, a high moisture content was 
maintained (>60 % of saturated volumetric water) to avoid any significant drought stress. The effect of water 
regimes on grain yield and Tc  differed significantly between the dry season (DS) and wet season (WS). DF 
significantly reduced yields by 13–26 % in the DS but not in the WS. However, the effect of DF on Tc at flowering 
time (0.2–0.3 ◦C increase) and spikelet sterility (3–5% increase) was relatively small even in the DS. In contrast, 
DF greatly increased Tc from solar noon to midnight, in particular during the period of ±3 h from sunset in the 
DS. At this time of the day, DF had a higher Tc than FL by 0.7–0.9 ◦C on average. The Tc did not differ between DF 
and FL either at flowering time or nighttime in the WS. The Tc changes over the course of the day imply that 
water-saving management may have a higher risk of yield reduction in the DS of the sub-humid tropics not only 
by increasing heat-induced sterility but also by increasing late-afternoon-to-nighttime temperatures, which can 
cause physiological stress and respiration loss. These results can help improve water-saving management prac-
tices under contrasting climatic conditions in the sub-humid tropics and predict the combined effect of increasing 
temperatures and water scarcity on rice production.   

1. Introduction 

Global warming is projected to increase both the frequency and in-
tensity of high temperature events, under all scenarios (Porter et al., 
2014). The hotter climate is likely to negatively impact rice production 
in many parts of the world (Nguyen et al., 2014; Teixeira et al., 2013; 
Wassmann et al., 2009). Moreover, drastic yield reductions induced by 
high temperature events have been reported in many rice-production 

areas in recent decades (Hasegawa et al., 2011; Ishimaru et al., 2016; 
Li et al., 2004; Welch et al., 2010). 
Rice is susceptible to heat stress, particularly in the flowering stage. 
More specifically, the reproductive processes that occur within one hour 
of anthesis-dehiscence of the anther are the most sensitive to heat stress 
(Matsui et al., 2000, 2001; Satake and Yoshida, 1978). The physiological 
effects of heat stress on sterility have been well studied under controlled 
conditions in climate chambers and phytotrons. However, the prediction

same yield levels were used. The fields were sandy, with pH 5.2–5.5, and 
extremely low total C and N and exchangeable cation levels, as is typical 
of the region (Table 1). In the five years preceding the start of the ex-
periments, both fields had been used for rice–rice cropping, except for 
one DS with vegetable cultivation in 2013. 
Rice was grown under continuous flooding (FL) in one field, and the 
same continuous flooding except for an approximately 20-day drainage 
treatment at the flowering period (DF) in the other. The DF and FL 
treatments were fixed in the respective fields across four seasons to 
ensure precise water management in an economically and logistically 
feasible manner. There were no replicates in water management because 
of a limited number of observation systems for canopy microclimates 
and  field  hydrology.  Before  the  start of  each  season, an  open  ditch 
(approximately 30 cm in width and 40 cm in depth) was constructed 
around and in the middle of the DF field to facilitate drainage and 
maintenance of moisture conditions during the treatment. 
Two varieties, IR64 and Jasmine85 (Ja85), were arranged in a ran-
domized complete-block design with four replicates, in both the FL and 
DF fields. The plot size was 5.7 m  × 4.5 m (25.65 m2). We did not 
establish  borders  between  plots  within  each  field  and  filled  in  the 
remaining space outside the plots with Ja85, to minimize border effects 
on the measurements of canopy microclimates. IR64 is a high-yielding 
mega variety in the tropics and is considered sensitive to heat stress 
(Coast et al., 2016). Ja85 is a popular variety in the region, and its 
sensitivity to heat stress is unknown. Ja85 had consistently longer du-
rations, by 8–11 days, than IR64 from transplanting to 50 % heading 
except  in  DF  in  the  2018  DS,  when  the  heading  date  of  Ja85  was 
significantly delayed by 8 days, relative to FL (Table 2). Apart from the 
2018 DS, the heading dates of both varieties differed little between FL 
and DF. 
The DF field was drained from the start of heading of IR64, for 
approximately 20 days, which covered the peak flowering days of both 
varieties. Throughout the drainage treatment, non-flooded but saturated 
soil moisture conditions were maintained by continuously flowing the 
water into open ditch, depending on rainfall events, to keep the water 
table high and to avoid drought stress. Except the treatment period, both 
the FL and DF fields were continuously flooded in the same manner. This 
minimized any growth differences prior to flowering that may occur 
from  water  management  practices  (e.g.,  canopy  development  and 
structure),  because differences  can alter  the  energy  balances  of  rice 
canopies. 
Aside from the different water regimes applied during the flowering 
periods, the same cultivation management practices were applied to 
both  fields:  they  were  plowed,  puddled,  and  transplanted  with  two 
seedlings per hill at a planting density of 22.2 hills per m2 (0.30 m ×
0.15 m per hill). A commercial NPK complex fertilizer (23:10:5) was

of heat-induced sterility and, thus, of the impact of climate change on 
rice production, remains uncertain because the inner-canopy tempera-
ture  can  differ  largely  from  ambient  temperature  under  open-field 
conditions.  For  instance,  lower-than-expected  spikelet  sterility  has 
been  reported  from  semiarid  to  arid  regions  in  Senegal  (Julia  and 
Dingkuhn, 2013) and southeastern Australia (Matsui et al., 2007, 2014), 
where daily maximum temperatures exceeded 40 ◦C. This was ascribed 
to a strong transpiration-cooling effect under low relative humidity (RH 
< 20 %). In contrast, under humid conditions where RH exceeded 75 % 
at  flowering  time,  the  panicle  or  inner-canopy  temperature  can  be 
higher than the air temperature (Tian et al., 2010; Yoshimoto et al., 
2012),. Inner-canopy or panicle temperature is also affected by wind 
velocity (Matsui et al., 1997) and CO2 concentration (Yoshimoto et al., 
2005).  Further,  rice  daily  flowering  time  depends  on  field  environ-
mental conditions such as ambient temperature, humidity (Julia and 
Dingkuhn, 2012), and solar radiation intensity (Kobayasi et al., 2010, 
2019), as well as on genetic differences (Ishimaru et al., 2010). Based on 
these  empirical  observations,  recent  models  have  been  improved  to 
predict the impacts of increasing temperatures on rice production by 
taking account into both panicle temperatures as a function of RH (van 
Oort et al., 2014) or using heat balance equations (Yoshimoto et al., 
2011) and flowering time, as a function of the aforementioned envi-
ronmental conditions (Julia and Dingkuhn, 2012; Nguyen et al., 2014). 
van Oort and Zwart (2018) applied a new heat sterility model for rice 
production in West Africa and predicted little increase in heat sterility in 
the future climate; they suggested that more empirical observations and 
model validations were needed in various climatic conditions. 
Field hydrological conditions are another factor which can cause air- 
temperature and panicle-temperature differences, and which are not 
integrated  into  heat  stress  prediction.  Many  studies  have  been  con-
ducted on water-saving management practices in direct-seeding, aero-
bic, and alternate-wet-and-dry (AWD) rice-production systems (Bouman 
and Tuong, 2001; Kumar and Ladha, 2011; Linquist et al., 2015a). For 
these  emerging  water-saving  technologies,  Jagadish  et  al.  (2015) 
warned that rice plants may become more vulnerable to heat-induced 
sterility as a result of stomatal closure and increased organ tempera-
tures even under high soil moisture conditions. In a pot experiment in 
controlled environment chambers, they observed that the canopy tem-
perature increased by  >2  ◦C at  (cid:0) 10 kPa of soil water potential (not 
considered a stress which whould reduce rice yields as per Carrijo et al., 
2017), relative to flooded condition. This is an important consideration 
in comprehending how to address the concomitant threat of increasing 
temperature and water scarcity for lowland rice production. However, 
there is little understanding about how these water-saving management 
practices, or unexpected water shortages, might affect diurnal changes 
in canopy temperature, flowering time, and heat-induced sterility in 
open fields. The lack of information is particularly critical in tropical 
regions, where the threats to crop production and food security from 
water  shortage  and  heat  stress  are  increasing  (Gourdji  et  al.,  2013; 
Porter et al., 2014; de Vries et al., 2010). More data is needed to improve 
predictions of how these threats will affect rice production in the tropics. 
Our objectives were, therefore, to evaluate these factors in open rice 
fields, in the dry and wet seasons, in the sub-humid tropics of northern 
Ghana. The specific objective was to elucidate the effects of water-saving 
management practices on diurnal changes in inner-canopy temperature, 
daily flowering time, spikelet sterility, and grain yield of rice, under 
various climatic conditions.

applied at the N rate of 70 kg ha(cid:0) 1 before transplanting, and ammonium 
sulfate was top-dressed at the N rate of 50 kg ha(cid:0) 1 approximately one 
month after transplanting (total N applied: 120 kg ha(cid:0) 1). Weeds and 
pests were controlled when they occurred using chemicals and by hand 
throughout the growing period. The cropping calendar for each season is 
summarized in Table 2. 

2.2. Measurements 

Within 10–14 days after reaching physiological maturity, rice plants 
in an area of 5.76 m2 (2.4 m × 2.4 m) were harvested from the middle of 
each plot to determine grain yield (t ha(cid:0) 1), which was corrected to a 14 
% moisture content using a grain moisture sensor (Riceter, Kett Electric 
Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan). Within the same sampling quadrat, eight 
average-sized hills were taken as subsamples to determine aboveground 
biomass, yield components, and spikelet sterility. Spikelet sterility was 
determined by counting the numbers of sinking and floating spikelets in 
70 % ethanol, as per Kobata et al. (2010). This parameter is normally 
lower than the ratio of unfilled grain number to the total grain num-
ber—which is often used to assess heat stresses on rice production—, but 
more  directly  relevant  to  high  temperature  events  in  the  anthe-
sis–pollination-fertilization process (van Oort et al., 2015). 
Inner-canopy temperature (Tc) was recorded at 2 min intervals, by 
placing  a  MINCER  (Micrometeorological  Instrument  for  the  Near- 
Canopy Environment of Rice) (Fukuoka et al., 2012) inside the can-
opy, from the start of heading to maturity. Briefly, the MINCER enables 
accurate measurements of Tc, using a solar-cell powered ventilator and 
micro-datalogger  located  inside  a  ventilated  radiation  shield.  The 
MINCER  was  placed  in  the  two  most  representative  plots,  having 
average plant growth and uniform phenological development. The Tc of 
the two plots was averaged for each variety in each water regime. The 
differences in Tc between FL and DF (DF (cid:0) FC) was calculated as ΔTc. A 
positive ΔTc indicates that Tc is higher in DF than in FL. The air intake, 
where the temperature sensor is located, was kept at panicle height by 
adjusting the position using the attached tripods. The air intake was 
located facing south to avoid direct sunlight. The device was set 2.5 m 
above ground level to record the above-canopy ambient temperature 
(Ta) and RH. Ambient vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was calculated from 
Ta and RH using the Tetens formula. In this way, the diurnal microcli-
matic  changes  above  and  within  the  canopy  were  monitored  at 
two-minute intervals. 

Daily flowering time was recorded from digital photographs taken at 
10 min intervals in the most representative plot for each variety, under 
each  water  regime,  throughout  the  flowering  period.  A  commercial 
digital  camera  (Optio  WG40,  Ricoh  Ltd.,  Tokyo,  Japan)  was  fixed 
approximately 60 cm above the canopy and inclined 45◦ from the ho-
rizon. The captured images were cropped to include the panicles of 
10–15 hills. From the images, we determined the initial spikelet opening 
time as the time when more than one spikelet lemma and palea had 
opened with visible anther extrusion, and peak spikelet opening time as 
the time when the maximum number of spikelets had opened. Mean 
initial and peak spikelet opening times for each plot were expressed in 
terms of hours after sunrise, and as the average over seven peak flow-
ering days, centered around the day of 50 % heading (including 3 days 
before and after). Rainy days in which flowering started in the afternoon 
were excluded, and in this case, post-50 % heading days were added for 
the calculation. Our observation period corresponded to the flowering of 
almost all of the spikelets, as per Nguyen et al. (2014). Daily maximum 
Ta, maximum Ta between initial and peak spikelet opening time, and 
maximum  Tc  between  initial  and  peak  spikelet  opening  time,  were 
calculated as the average over the seven observation days for each va-
riety, water regime, and season. The times of apparent sunrise, apparent 
sunset, and solar noon at the experimental site, for each observation 
date,  were  calculated  using  the  online  Solar  Calculator  (National 
Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 
https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/).  The  50  %  heading 
date was visually estimated from the same digital photographs. The 50 
% heading day was defined as the day when approximately half of the 
panicles in each image visually appeared from the flag leaf sheath. 
Daily  changes  in  volumetric  soil  moisture  content  (θ,  %)  were 
monitored by installing soil moisture sensors (EC-5, Meter Group, Inc., 
WA, USA) and dataloggers (Em5b, Meter Group Inc., WA, USA) 20 cm 
below the soil surface, with four replicates in the DF field, from trans-
planting  to  maturity.  Daily  weather  conditions  throughout  growing 
periods—temperature, RH, solar radiation, and rainfall—were recorded 
by a Hobo Weather Station (U30-NRC Data Logger, Onset Hobo Inc., 
MA, USA) in a village near the experimental fields. 
2.3. Statistical analysis 

JMP 14 software (JMP 14.0.0, SAS Institute Inc.) was used for sta-
tistical analysis. A generalized linear model was used to determine the 
effect of variety in each water regime on the variables for each growing 
season and for all the seasons pooled. The replicate was treated as a 
random factor within each water regime. When analyzing the effect of 
season and its interaction with variety in each water regime, observa-
tions from different years (2016 and 2017 WS, and 2017 and 2018 DS) 
were treated as repeated measurements. Tukey’s honestly significant 
difference test was conducted to compare the mean values at the 5% 
probability level. In the 2016 WS, two replicates of Ja85 located in the 
southwest  corner  of  the  FL  field  were  excluded  from  data  analysis 
because of severe damage from flooding stress, caused by intense rainfall 
soon after planting. The logistic sigmoid function curve was applied to 
correlate spikelet sterility rate against maximum Tc from initial and peak 
spikelet  opening  time,  maximum  Ta  from  initial  and  peak  spikelet 
opening time, and daily maximum Ta, as per Horie et al. (1995). For the 
nonlinear regression, we assumed that the spikelet sterility rate (%) took 
a lower limit of 2.2 % from the observed data and an upper limit of 100 
%. The significance of the adjusted coefficient of determination for the 
regression model was determined using a Student’s t-test. The threshold 
above which spikelet sterility increased was assumed as the temperature 
(◦C) when the derivative of fitted curve was  >10 % of its maximum 
value.  The  slope  in  the  observation  range  and  above  the  threshold 
temperature was used to estimate the response of spikelet sterility to a 
unit of temperature change.

3. Results 
3.1. Weather conditions during the cropping season 

In the 2018 DS, both IR64 and Ja85 were exposed to Tmax continu-
ously above 35 ◦C, and even above 40 ◦C during their heading periods 
(Fig.  1). In the 2017 DS, Tmax  was mostly above 35  ◦C; during the 
heading period, it reached 38.3 ◦C for IR64, and remained at 35 ◦C for 
Ja85. The significantly higher Tmax in the 2018 DS arose because we 
transplanted 21 days earlier in 2018 DS than in 2017 DS (Table 2). 
During the WS, Tmax was mostly below 35 ◦C during the heading periods 
of both varieties; Tmax gradually increased with decreasing RH during 
later growth stages, as the hot and dry season approached. In the DS, 
Tmax decreased as RH increased, especially later in the season. There-
fore, Ja85, which headed later than IR64, was exposed to higher Tmax 
and lower RH in the WS, and to lower Tmax and higher RH in the DS. 
3.2. Hydrological dynamics in alternate wetting-and-drying treatment 

In all cropping seasons, volumetric soil moisture contents (θ,  %) 
fluctuated between 36 % and 42 % during the flooding period before the 
start of DF treatment (Fig. 2). After drainage at the start of IR64 heading, 
θ declined to minima of 35 % in the 2016 WS and 32 % in the 2017 wet 
and dry seasons, and recovered after reflooding. Consecutive days of θ 
<38 % occurred at 60–75 DAT in the 2017 WS and 54–70 DAT in the 
2017 DS, which mostly covered the peak flowering days of both vari-
eties. The  θ  did not decrease as intended in the 2016 WS, probably 
because of frequent rainfall events during the treatment period. In the 
2018 DS, θ followed the same trend as the other seasons at the start of 
the drainage treatment but declined to as low as 26 % at 86 days after 
transplanting. This minimum θ occurred 14 days after the 50 % heading 
date of Ja85. This unexpected reduction in θ, and the prolonged aerobic 
condition of the soil, was caused by a lack of irrigation at the appropriate 
time.  Except  for  this  unexpected  reduction  in  the  2018  DS,  θ  was

maintained above 32 % throughout the growing periods in both the wet 
and dry seasons. 
3.3. Grain yield, biomass production and spikelet sterility 

There were large variations in grain yields, from 4.7 to 7.7 t ha(cid:0) 1, 
depending on the variety, water regime, and growing season (Table 4). 
They were greater in the DS than WS with a significant interaction be-
tween season and variety in each water regime (Table 3). In the 2017 DS, 
grain yield was significantly lower in DF than FL, by 15 % for IR64 and 
13 % for Ja85; in the 2018 DS, the reduction caused by DF was greater, 
at 26 % for IR64 and 18 % for Ja85. In the WS, however, the yield re-
sponses  were  not  significantly  different  among  varieties  in  different 
water regimes (Table 3). In the 2016 WS, Ja85 had significantly greater 
yield than IR64 in DF, whereas there were no significant differences for 
the same varieties in different water regimes. In the 2017 WS, there were 
no significant differences among varieties in different water regimes. 
Aboveground biomass showed similar changes to grain yield in response 
to variety in different water regimes and growing seasons (Tables 3 and 
4). Aboveground biomass averaged over two years was significantly 
greater in FL than in DF for both varieties in the DS but not in the WS. 
Spikelet sterility ranged from 2.3%–11.8% between the varieties in 
different water regimes and growing seasons (Table 4). The effect of 
season was not significant, but there was a significant interaction on 
spikelet sterility between the season and variety in different water re-
gimes (Table 3). Spikelet sterility was significantly higher in DF than FL 
for both varieties in the DS although the difference was relatively small. 
On the other hand, spikelet sterility little differed among varieties or 
water regimes in the WS.

3.4. Flowering time 

The time of sunrise during the peak flowering days differed little 
among growing seasons or varieties, ranging from 05:43 at the earliest 
(Ja85 in the 2017 DS) to 05:54 at the latest (IR64 in the 2017 WS) (local 
standard  time).  Flowering  times  (initial  and  peak  spikelet  opening 
times) differed significantly between the dry and wet seasons (Fig. 3). 
Flowering time was earlier in the DS than in the WS, by 37–52 min 
(mean 42 min) for initial spikelet opening time, and by 35–50 min 
(mean 44 min) for peak spikelet opening time, regardless of variety and 
water regime. When pooling the growing seasons and water regimes, 
initial and peak spikelet opening times were significantly earlier in IR64 
than in Ja85, by 12 min and 10 min, respectively. There were no sig-
nificant differences in initial and peak spikelet opening times of the same 
varieties between FL and DF for any seasons or all seasons pooled. 

3.5. Microclimate at flowering time under different water regimes 
3.5.1. Wet season 
Fig. 4 shows the diurnal changes in microclimate averaged over the 
peak flowering days (n = 7) for each variety in response to water regime 
in the WS. Ta and VPD for IR64 was missing for 2016 WS due to an 
instrument  error  (Fig.  4A).  Ta  increased  gradually  after  sunrise  and 
reached 29.9 ◦C for IR64 in the 2017 WS (Fig. 4 B), 31.3 ◦C for Ja85 in 
the 2016 WS (Fig. 4C), and 30.2 ◦C for Ja85 in the 2017 WS (Fig. 4D) at 
maximum  of  around  8.13–8.83  h  after  sunrise  (13:56–14:42  local 
standard time). Maximum Ta during the flowering time (from initial to 
peak flowering) was lower by 0.9–2.0 ◦C than the daily maximum Ta. 
In both FL and DF, Tc was equal to or slightly higher than Ta in the 
morning, but slightly lower than Ta  in the afternoon. The difference 
between Tc and Ta in the afternoon was particularly large (up to 1 ◦C) for 
Ja85 in the 2016 WS. For both varieties, Tc was slightly higher in DF 
than FL (by 0.1–0.2 ◦C on average) in the afternoon in both years. On the 
other hand, the effect of water regime on Tc was negligible ((cid:0) 0.1 ◦C <
ΔTc  < 0.1  ◦C) in the nighttime (sunset to sunrise), morning, and at

flowering time for both IR64 and Ja85 in the WS. 
3.5.2. Dry season 
In the DS, maximum Ta during the flowering time was 31.3 ◦C (IR64, 
2017 DS), 31.9 ◦C (IR64, 2018 DS), 31.1 ◦C (Ja85, 2017 DS), and 31.6 ◦C 
(Ja85, 2018 DS) (Fig. 5A–D, respectively), and further increased to daily 
maxima of 35.3 ◦C, 34.4 ◦C, 34.3 ◦C, and 34.1 ◦C, respectively, around 
9.57–10.23 h after sunrise or 15:22–15:50 local standard time. Relative 
to the WS, VPD in the DS was much greater; in the morning, at 0.43–1.63 
kPa (IR64, 2017 DS), 0.38–1.64 kPa (IR64, 2018 DS), 0.26–1.40 kPa 
(Ja85, 2017 DS), and 0.35–1.45 kPa (Ja85, 2018 DS); in the afternoon at 
1.51–2.22  kPa,  1.62–2.14  kPa,  1.02–1.84  kPa,  and  1.26–1.79  kPa, 
respectively. The difference in VPD between WS and DS was particularly 
large in the afternoon. 
The effect of evaporative cooling was much greater in the DS than the 
WS: Tc was consistently lower than Ta, particularly in the FL treatment, 
throughout the day. The greatest differences between Tc and Ta observed 
within the peak flowering days were 5.9  ◦C (IR64, 2017 DS), 5.5  ◦C 
(IR64, 2018 DS), 5.1 ◦C (Ja85, 2018 DS), and 5.7 ◦C (Ja85, 2018 DS) 
(data not shown). For both varieties in both years, Tc did not greatly 
differ between DF and FL in the morning. Averaged ΔTc from initial to

measurements  of  ambient  temperature  above 
the  canopy  was  failed  due  to  an  operational 
error  during  the  heading  periods  of  IR64. 
Instead, air temperature and VPD measured by 
the weather station in the experimental village 
was shown in dotted lines (30-min interval).   

peak flowering times were slightly greater than the WS but only by 
0.2–0.3  ◦C.  In  contrast,  ΔTc  greatly  increased  from  solar  noon  to 
midnight relative to the WS for both varieties in the 2017 DS and 2018 
DS. ΔTc was particularly large in the period ±3 h from sunset. In this 
time of the day, AWD had higher Tc than FL on average by 0.7 ◦C (IR64, 
2017 DS), 0.9 ◦C (IR64; 2018 DS), 0.9 ◦C (Ja85; 2017 DS), and 0.7 ◦C 
(Ja85, 2018 DS). 
3.6. Relationship between inner-canopy temperature and spikelet sterility 
Daily maximum Ta during the peak flowering days had a wide range, 
from  30.2  ◦C  to  35.7  ◦C,  much  higher  in  DS  than  WS.  In  contrast, 
maximum Tc during the flowering time had a narrower range, from 29.1 
◦C to 31.1 ◦C, because of the high evaporative-cooling effect and early 
flowering times in the DS (Fig. 6). Spikelet sterility was significantly 
fitted to the logistic curve in the function of maximum Tc at flowering 
time across different growing seasons except 2017 WS (Fig. 6). The 
estimated  threshold  temperature  above  which  spikelet  sterility 
increased was 30.2 ◦C or 4.8 % of the estimated spikelet sterility. Using 
the fitted curve, the spikelet sterility increased by 7.6 % on average per 
◦C of maximum Tc at flowering time above the threshold temperature 
and within the observation range. DF had slightly higher spikelet ste-
rility and higher maximum Tc at flowering time than FL, for both vari-
eties in the DS (Table 4). In the 2017 WS, spikelet sterility tended to be 
high relative to the other seasons, despite there being relatively low 
maximum Ta at flowering time. However, it should be noted that the 
observation  values  of  spikelet  sterility  were  relatively  low  for  any 

variety,  water  regime  or  growing  season.  Spikelet  sterility  was  not 
correlated  with  either  the  maximum  Ta  at  flowering  time  or  daily 
maximum Ta, and thus the data is not shown. 
4. Discussion 
4.1. Diurnal changes in inner-canopy temperature and impact on grain 
yield of different water regimes 

This study provides the first open-field evidence of how different 
water-saving management practices in lowland rice production can alter 
inner-canopy temperature over the course of the day and, in turn, affect 
spikelet sterility and grain yield. Further, we tested these effects under 
contrasting climatic conditions. Except in the 2018 DS, our drainage 
treatment (DF) was similar in magnitude to a so-called “mild AWD” (i.e. 
when soil water potential was ≥ (cid:0) 20 kPa or field water level did not 
drop below 15 cm from the soil surface as per Carrijo et al., 2017), which 
has been reported to result in little yield reduction for rice. Given a 
typical soil moisture retention curve for the sandy loam soils (Gupta and 
Larson, 1979), the fields should have been saturated or at least above 
field capacity (> (cid:0) 10 kPa) throughout the DF treatment. In the 2018 DS, 
an unexpected reduction in soil moisture after the peak flowering days 
and prolonged drainage treatment might have caused drought stress to 
rice plants, as indicated by the delayed heading dates for Ja85, and 
further exacerbated yield reductions in DF. Yet, the lowest reduction of θ 
at 26 % can be still regarded as a range with little yield penalties from 
drought stress under the humid summer in Arkansas, USA according to 

FieldCropsResearch260(2021)1079786Y. Tsujimoto et al.

The average of two replicates over peak flow-
ering days (7 observation days around the day 
of 50 % heading excluding any rainy days) in FL 
was  depicted.  Grey  bars  within  each  figure 
indicate the period from initial to peak spikelet 
opening  time.  Orange lines  indicate  the solar 
noon and apparent sunset time.   

Linquist et al. (2015b). 
As indicated by Jagadish et al. (2015), DF certainly increased Tc 
during the flowering time and increased spikelet sterility. However, the 
change in spikelet sterility was relatively small by 3–5%, and the effect 
was found only in the DS but not in the WS. Moreover, the increases in 
heat-induced sterility were much smaller than expected from the yield 
penalties observed in the DS. This apparent discrepancy in magnitudes 
between spikelet sterility and yield reductions with DF is an important 
finding and might be related to large increases in Tc from solar noon to 
nighttime,  particularly  ±3  h  from  sunset.  The  adverse  impacts  of 
increased nighttime temperature on rice production through respiration 
losses and physiological stresses have been widely reported (Katsura 
et al., 2009; Mohammed and Tarpley, 2009a,2009b; Peng et al., 2004; 
Shi et al., 2016; Welch et al., 2010). 
In the present study, the canopy development and leaf area—which 
cause differences in canopy transpiration mass and transmissivity of 
solar radiation on the ground/water surface—should have differed little 
between DF and FL because both fields had the same water management 
prior to the start of the treatment. Therefore, a major reason for changes 
in microclimates with DF is partial stomatal closure and reduction in 
canopy transpiration. Under aerobic water regimes, Kato and Okami 
(2010)  observed  that rice  plants  closed  stomata  (indicating  drought 
stress) even with a soil moisture contents above field capacity. This 
response should be greater in the afternoon as rice plants generally 
reduce stomatal conductance and assimilation rates when VPD is high 
on account of an internal water deficit even under flooded conditions 
(Hirasawa et al., 1992; Morison and Gifford, 1983). Additionally, under

We found that there was no relationship between maximum ambient 
temperature during the peak flowering days and spikelet sterility. We 
ascribe this to the large evaporative-cooling effect (temperature differ-
ence between air and inner-canopy) and early daily flowering time in 
the DS. This is consistent with previous observations under open-field 
conditions  and  model  analysis  (e.g.,  Matsui  et  al.,  2007;  van  Oort 
et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2010). The difference in initial and peak spikelet 
opening times between the dry and wet seasons is consistent with pre-
vious studies, which found that flowering time can be advanced by 
higher  minimum ambient  temperatures in  the preceding seven days 
(Julia and Dingkuhn, 2012), or by higher mean air temperature and 
higher solar radiation on the morning of the day (Kobayasi et al., 2019). 
We found that there was no significant difference in flowering time 
between DF and FL in either the DS or WS, implying that inner-canopy 
temperatures from late afternoon to midnight did not affect the flow-
ering times to a large degree. These open-field observations should help 
our understanding of how water-saving management practices affect 
heat-induced  stresses  under  contrasting  climatic  conditions  in  the 
sub-humid tropics. 
5. Conclusions 

Y. Tsujimoto et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
dry climatic conditions, most of the available energy is consumed as 
latent heat flux, and thus the effect of stomatal closure on energy par-
titioning can be high, inducing large increases in canopy temperature. 
These mechanisms may explain the large ΔTc in late afternoon in the DS 
when VPD is at its highest, while the values were relatively small in the 
morning and in the WS. By monitoring dry-season paddy field energy 
fluxes in the tropics, Alberto et al. (2009) also observed higher sensible 
heat flux and lower latent heat flux (canopy transpiration) under an 
aerobic water regime, which elevated the air temperature and VPD near 
the canopy during the daytime particularly in the afternoon. The sto-
matal closure and increase in ΔTc in the afternoon could have caused 
more respiration loss and reduced assimilation even under saturated 
conditions in DF. 
The mechanism for continuously positive ΔTc after sunset in the DS is 
not clear but may be related to the dry wind blowing on the experi-
mental fields (the VPD remained high >1 kPa after sunset in the DS). The 
time variation of ΔTc at this period of day was almost proportional to the 
change in wind speed (data not shown). These winds induce evaporation 
from the water/soil surface, and the evaporation-cooling effect should 
be larger in FL with water surface than in DF with a wet soil surface. 
The Tc changes over the course of the day in different water man-
agement and contrasting climatic conditions imply that non-flooded and 
saturated water management has a higher risks of yield reduction in the 
DS of the sub-humid tropics through a combination of small increases in 
Tc during flowering time, inducing spikelet sterility, and the cumulative 
effects of reduced assimilation resulting from stomatal closure and high 
Tc  (high respiration loss) in the afternoon and nighttime. The latter 
cumulative effect could have increased the yield difference between FL 
and DF in the 2018 DS under the prolonged non-flooded conditions. This 
effect may also explain the field observation in de Vries et al. (2010), in 
which mild AWD during the reproductive growth stage imposed a yield 
penalty of 9–14 % only in the DS but not in the WS in a similar climate in 
Senegal. Further studies are needed to quantify how increased Tc in the 
afternoon to nighttime affect grain yields under water-saving manage-
ment practices. 
4.2. Relationship between inner-canopy temperature and spikelet sterility 
Our findings elucidate the significant and logistic relationship be-
tween canopy microclimate, as shown by maximum inner-canopy tem-
perature (Tc) during the flowering time and spikelet sterility under open- 
field conditions in both wet and dry seasons, with the exception of 2017 
WS dataset. In the 2017 WS, we observed that spikelet sterility started to 
increase at a lower threshold; however, the reason for this is unknown. 
The estimated threshold Tc (30.2 ◦C) is slightly higher by 0.5 ◦C than the 
previous observations using the same IR64 variety under a temperature- 
controlled chamber (Jagadish et al., 2007) and open-field conditions 
(Julia and Dingkuhn, 2013). The estimated increase in spikelet sterility 
per unit of Tc change (7.6 % per  ◦C) was comparable to previous ob-
servations  at  the  initial  responding  phase  in  temperature-controlled 
chambers (Jagadish et al., 2007; Weerakoon et al., 2008) and compa-
rable to or slightly higher than those under open-field conditions (Julia 
and Dingkuhn, 2013; Yan et al., 2010). These previous reports support 
the reliability of the regression model for the spikelet sterility response 
to a unit increase in Tc. There have been few field-based studies into the 
relationship between spikelet sterility and organ temperatures which 
leads to uncertainty in predicting the effect of heat stresses on rice yield 
(van Oort et al., 2014, 2015; 2018). Thus, the dataset obtained here is 
valuable for improving the impact assessment of increasing tempera-
tures  on  lowland  rice  production  in  the  sub-humid  tropics.  If  the 
extrapolation beyond the observation range is allowed, higher temper-
ature conditions may enlarge the difference in spikelet sterility between 
flooded  and  saturated  field  conditions  because  of  the  exponential 
response  curve.  However,  it  should be noted  that the  magnitude  of 
spikelet sterility was somewhat lower than those observed even under 
open-field conditions, and the range of both spikelet sterility and Tc at 

In the context of climate change, the combination of high tempera-
tures and water shortages poses a threat to rice production in the tropics. 
However, little is known about how water-saving management affects 
rice heat stress and grain yield under open-field conditions. We assessed 
diurnal changes in Tc and its relationship with heat-induced sterility and 
grain yield of rice, during the wet and dry seasons in the sub-humid 
tropics  in  northern  Ghana.  Compared  to  the  flooded conditions,  we 
found  that  (1)  the  non-flooded  and  saturated  conditions  increased 
flowering-time Tc and heat-induced sterility, but the effect was marginal 
and only in the DS; (2) the non-flooded and saturated conditions greatly 
increased dry-season Tc from late afternoon to nighttime, which may 
explain the greater than expected yield reductions from increases in 
sterility;  and  (3)  dry-season  heat-induced  sterility  was  lower  than 
anticipated from the extremely high ambient temperatures, because of 
the  large  evaporative-cooling  effect  and  early  flowering  time.  The 
physiological responses of rice to increased Tc from late afternoon to 
midnight,  and  its  relationship  with  productivity  under  water-saving 
management, should be further explored.
