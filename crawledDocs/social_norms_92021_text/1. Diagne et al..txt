Abstract 
 
Urban demand for fragrant rice is increasing rapidly in Senegal, but little is known about the value 
of rice fragrance and the drivers of its demand. We conducted experimental auctions in Dakar to 
elicit  urban  consumers’  willingness  to  upgrade  from  non-fragrant  to  fragrant  rice  and  their 
willingness to pay for domestic versus imported fragrant rice, and assessed the drivers of demand for 
rice fragrance through a double-hurdle model. The average value of rice fragrance is estimated to 
be around US$ 0.12 kg-1, as suggested by the 20% price premiums consumers are willing to pay on 
top of the price of non-fragrant rice. These price premiums further increase to 35% for consumers 
who express positive buying intentions towards domestic fragrant rice. The value of rice fragrance is 
found to be driven by factors such as ethnicity, household size, and awareness of fragrance and local 
fragrant rice.

1. Introduction 
 
In West Africa, rice consumption has increased dramatically in recent years. Average annual growth 
rates of rice consumption were 4.94% and 7.50% during the periods 2000 to 2008 and 2008 to 2015 
respectively.  The  three  biggest  rice  importers  in  the  region  witnessed  the  highest  growth  in 
consumption during these periods: Nigeria recorded 4.83% and 5.99%; Cote d’Ivoire 3.12% and 
10.91%;  and  Senegal  5.16%  and  7.16%  (USDA  2016).  The  main  drivers  of  this  increase  are 
population  growth  with  increasing  urbanisation,  an  increase  in  income,  and  changing  consumer 
habits. Preferences for rice may vary between countries, and even within countries between rural and 
urban  areas.  While  local  rice  is  popular  in some  countries (e.g.  Mali), urban  consumers  in  other 
countries (e.g. Senegal) have developed strong preferences for imported fragrant rice (Demont & 
Ndour 2015). 
 
In the last 50 years, traditional staple grains such as millet and sorghum have been surpassed by rice 
as the most imported cereal in the Senegalese diet (World Bank 2013). Urban dwellers consume more 
rice  (around  95  kg per  capita)  than  rural  dwellers  (around  65  kg  per  capita)  and  have  markedly 
different preferences for rice (World Bank 2013; Niang et al. 2014). Urban consumers tend to prefer 
imported broken rice, whereas rural consumers demand whole-grain local rice (World Bank 2013).

Rice grain quality can be defined in terms of physical, cooking and sensory characteristics; consumers 
value the quality of rice based on the appearance, shape and size of the grain, the behaviour upon 
cooking, and the taste, tenderness and flavour (Singh et al. 2000; Fitzgerald 2010). Aromatic rice, 
also  known  as  fragrant,  perfumed,  scented,  flavoured  or  pecan  varieties,  has  been  cultivated  for 
centuries in  South  and  South-East Asia  and  is highly  prized  (Itani  et  al.  2004).  Aromatic  rice is 
characterised by the presence of a popcorn or baked bread-like flavour compound called 2-acetyl-1-
pyrroline  (2AP),  and  the  aroma  could  also  be  determined  by  smelling  and  tasting  cooked  grains 
(Calingacion et al. 2014). Renowned fragrant rice varieties like Basmati and Jasmine are very popular 
in Africa, Europe, Australia and the USA, allowing them to command substantial price premiums 
over their non-fragrant counterparts (Bhattacharjee et al. 2002). African rice-breeding programmes 
therefore increasingly turn their attention towards breeding for fragrance (Asante et al. 2010). 
 
On the international market, three main rice varieties are traded, viz. Indica, Japonica and fragrant 
rice. Indica rice varieties thrive well in tropical climates, and also in temperate climatic conditions, 
and represent the lion’s share of world rice production. In temperate and tropical-upland climatic 
zones, the main rice type cultivated and consumed is Japonica rice. Fragrant rice belongs to the Indica 
long-grain rice family and is often considered separately because of its distinctive aroma (FAO 2006). 
According to Slayton (2015), fragrant rice typically accounts for 15% of total world trade; it exceeded 
5.7 million tons in 2010. The three leading exporters of aromatic rice are Thailand, Pakistan and India. 
High-quality  fragrant  rice  is  exported  to  rich  countries,  whereas  fragrant  broken  grain  is  often 
exported to Africa, mainly to the Ivory Coast, Senegal and Ghana. Thai Jasmine broken rice averaged 
almost 725 000 tons from 2008 to 2010, with about 85% of the shipments destined for Africa, while 
the balance is almost evenly split between Asian and European markets. Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire 
are the leading import markets for Thai Jasmine brokens, with each taking almost 225 000 tons in 
2010. The actual trend of consumer preferences in these two countries is increasingly oriented toward 
the consumption of inexpensive, mostly Jasmine broken rice from Thailand, which is suitable for a 
rice dish paired with fish called Céébu jën that originated in Senegal (Coulibaly et al. 2015). Aromatic 
Thai rice represents about 25% of Senegalese rice imports (World Bank 2013). In 2009, AfricaRice 
and  its  National  Agricultural  Research  and  Extension  Services  (NARES)  partners  released  three 
fragrant rice varieties, viz. Sahel 177, Sahel 328 and Sahel 329. Sahel 177 has the highest yield 
potential, Sahel 328 has the shortest growth duration and Sahel 329 is appreciated the most for its 
taste (Kumashiro et al. 2013). In 2013, the total production of fragrant rice in Senegal was estimated 
at  40 000  tons  (USDA  2013),  representing  around  15%  of  the  total  fragrant  rice  imports  of  the 
country. Although aromatic rice varieties are of great interest to farmers, as they command a higher 
price  than  non-aromatic  rice,  very  little  is  known  about  the  value  of  rice  fragrance  and  the 
determinants of the demand for fragrant rice in Africa. Filling this knowledge gap would provide 
crucial information to rice breeders, policy makers and value chain stakeholders in their struggle to 
upgrade rice value chains in order to enhance the competitiveness of domestic versus imported rice 
(Demont 2013; Demont & Ndour 2015). 
 
Experimental auctions are commonly used to assess consumers’ valuation of the quality attributes of 
food products (Lusk & Shogren 2007). Attributes are product characteristics that are either intrinsic, 
like taste, texture and colour, or extrinsic, like packaging, brand and label (Rutsaert et al. 2013). In 
an experimental auction, people bid to buy real products using real money in a setting employing 
rules that provide incentives for people to truthfully reveal their value for each product up for sale. 
The bids obtained in experimental auctions are interpreted as the maximum amount consumers are 
willing  to  pay  for  the  new  good.  Since  2008,  experimental  auctions  have  been  conducted  by 
AfricaRice  in  Senegal  (Saint-Louis,  Dakar  and  Kolda),  Benin,  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  Côte 
d’Ivoire, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, the Gambia, and Uganda in order to elicit consumers’ 
willingness to pay (WTP) for rice quality and marketing attributes (Demont & Ndour 2015; Demont 
et  al.  2017).  The  current  study  was  conducted  in  Dakar  and  aimed  to  analyse  whether  the  three

fragrant  rice  varieties  recently  introduced  in  the  Senegal  River  Valley  are  competitive  against 
imported fragrant rice. The Dakar region is a huge, urban consumption pole; although it only covers 
0.3% of the national area, it is home to nearly 23% of the total population and 75% of the urban 
population (ANSD & ICF International 2012). Hence, understanding the drivers of urban demand for 
rice fragrance in Dakar is of crucial importance for rice value chain upgrading and enabling poor 
farmers to tap into these market opportunities to improve their livelihood. 
 
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 outlines the methodology, Section 3 
describes the data and results, and Section 4 concludes. 
 
2. Methodology 
 
2.1 Experimental design 
 
We conducted a series of framed field experiments based on experimental auctions in the major urban 
consumption  zones  of  fragrant  rice,  remote  from  the  rice  production  zones.  We  used  a  similar 
procedure  as  described  in  Akoa  Etoa  et  al.  (2016)  and  Demont  et  al.  (2012;  2013a;  2013b)  and 
reviewed by Demont and Ndour (2015). The experiments were conducted during four days in July 
2011, during which eight experimental auction sessions were conducted, with one in the morning and 
one in the afternoon. Female rice shoppers were targeted, as women are the major decision makers in 
households’ rice purchases (Demont & Ndour 2015). The experimental auctions were carried out in 
the Salle Docteur Samba Gueye at the Tilène market of Dakar. All types of consumers visit it and all 
types of rice can be found there. Dakar is the largest area for fragrant rice consumption in the country. 
For each session, 15 women were randomly selected and recruited on the spot. The auctions were 
based  on  the  “endow-and-upgrade”  method,  in  which  each  participant  is  endowed  with  a  fixed 
“benchmark” rice and is presented four times with the option to upgrade it to an alternative rice type. 
 
We purposely selected the benchmark and four alternative “upgrades” so that we could benchmark 
local fragrant rice against non-fragrant and fragrant imported rice, which provides crucial information 
for value chain upgrading. Since the dominant grain quality demanded by urban consumers in Senegal 
is broken rice (World Bank 2013), all rice types were 100% broken. The benchmark was imported, 
non-fragrant “Baobab” rice from Thailand, while the four upgrades were (i) imported fragrant “Thai 
Hom Mali” rice from Thailand; (ii) local fragrant Sahel 177; (iii) local fragrant Sahel 328; and (iv) 
local fragrant Sahel 329. In order to avoid lining-up bias (Demont et al. 2012), we avoided any linear 
presentation of the rice types on the participants’ tables and instead presented the benchmark rice in 
the middle and surrounded it by the four alternative upgrades in a quadrangular way. We asked the 
auctioneers to collect WTP values in random order, avoiding any perception of a linear relationship 
or ranking among the alternative rice types. 
 
We endowed women with one kilogram of the benchmark and asked them what price premium they 
were willing to pay to upgrade to any of “four alternative fragrant rice types”. We did not reveal the 
variety or origin of the products, but only mentioned that the benchmark rice was non-fragrant and 
the  alternative  rice  types  were  fragrant.  The  auction  procedure  was  explained  in  Wolof,  with 
translations to Pulaar and French where necessary. 
 
During  the  experiment,  the  participants  could  examine  the  visual  (purity  and  homogeneity)  and 
sensory (taste and aroma) quality attributes of the uncooked rice types (taste is typically tested by 
biting  on  the  uncooked  grains).  We  chose  the  Vickrey  (1961)  second-price  auction  mechanism, 
according to which participants submit sealed bids on a product in a group context and the highest 
bidder buys the product at the second price. In combination with the endow-and-upgrade method, this 
implies that the bids represent the price premiums bidders are willing to pay in order to upgrade the

benchmark rice to an alternative rice type. The winner exchanges her benchmark for the upgrade and 
all losing bidders retain their benchmark. This auction mechanism has proven to be successful for 
assessing consumers’ willingness to pay for rice quality attributes in the African context (Demont & 
Ndour 2015). 
 
We conducted two bidding rounds, separated by a “within-subjects” sensory test to capture the effect 
of post-cooking quality attributes on WTP. During the sensory test we provided the participants with 
cooked samples of the five rice types and requested them to taste the rice types and rinse their mouths 
to  cleanse  their  palates  between  samples.  This  provided  the  participants  with  an  opportunity  to 
observe the swelling capacity and experience the sensory quality attributes (aroma, taste, texture and 
stickiness) of the cooked rice types. At the end of the two bidding rounds, we randomly selected one 
upgrade  and  one  round  as  binding.  Finally,  we  administered  a  questionnaire  to  collect  socio-
demographic data. 
 
2.2 Methodology for analysing the drivers of demand for rice fragrance  
 
Food consumption decisions can be modelled as a two-stage process (Haines et al. 1988; Wooldridge 
2001). The double-hurdle model of Cragg (1971) correctly represents this process. Participants first 
decide whether they are willing to upgrade their endowed kilogram of rice or not and, if yes, they 
then decide which price premium they are willing to pay for the upgrade. 
 
In  this  regard,  let  WTUijpr  be  the  variable  representing  the  willingness  to  upgrade  an  endowed 
kilogram of rice as a dichotomous ‘adoption’ variable (willing to upgrade or not), and let WTPijpr be 
the amount spent on the upgrade by the ith consumer (i = 1, …, 15) in the jth session (j = 1, …, 8) for 
the pth rice type (p = imported Thai Hom Mali fragrant rice; local fragrant Sahel 177; local fragrant 
Sahel 328; local fragrant Sahel 329) in the rth bidding round (r = 0 before tasting, r = 1 after tasting): 
 
WTU
 
WTP
 
where xijpr is a vector of independent variables, including three product dummy variables (Sahel 177, 
Sahel 328 and Sahel 329) identifying the three alternative rice types (Thai Hom Mali fragrant rice is 
set as the reference), one dummy variable for the bidding round, a dummy variable for the time of the 
day, and a vector of socio-demographic variables xv (v = 1, …, s = 32);  is a conformable vector of 
coefficients, uij is an individual specific disturbance for participant i in session j, and vijpr is the overall 
error term. Following Cragg (1971), WTPijpr is the consumers’ bid to upgrade the mediocre-quality 
benchmark rice to any of the three alternatives. The first hurdle is the consumer’s decision on whether 
or not to upgrade (willingness to upgrade or WTU). The probability of the respondent choosing not 
to bid a positive amount in order to upgrade (WTPijpr = 0) is expressed by:  
 
P
 
where  Φ  is  the  standard  normal  density  function.  The  second  hurdle  determines  the  effect  of 
independent variables on WTPijpr, given WTUijpr = 1 > 0. The distribution of WTPijpr conditional on 
being positive is truncated at zero and assumed normal with mean 
2  and variance σ2. The second 
hurdle is formulated as:

3. Results 
 
3.1 Socio-demographic characteristics of the sample of rice shoppers 
 
Table 1 summarises the key sociodemographic characteristics of the rice shoppers. A total of 120 
women participated in the auctions. Although Senegal has more than 20 ethnic groups, over 90% of 
the population belongs to five dominant ethnic groups: Wolof (43%), Pulaar (24%), Sereer (15%), 
Diola (5%) and Mandingo (4%) (ANSD & ICF International 2012). The ethnic composition of our 
urban  sample  was  remarkably  consistent  with  these  national  averages,  as  these  ethnic  groups 
represented 83% of the sample, with Wolof at 45%, Pulaar at 11%, Sereer at 18%, Diola at 4%, 
Bambara at 5% and Lebou at 3%. This suggests that our sample is representative with respect to 
ethnic representation. 
 
The  average  age  was  around  39  years.  Eighteen  percent  of  the  women  had  achieved  secondary 
education and 62% were active as traders, 5% as restaurant holders, 15% were housewives and 13% 
were employed. Forty-three percent of the women were members of a social network. Only 7% of 
the  women  had  a  cooking  housemaid,  meaning  that  most  of  the  women  were  involved  in 
housekeeping and cooking. The average monthly household income was about 188 000 FCFA (US$ 
409.59). The average household size was around 10 persons, which is consistent with the national 
average  of  eight  to  nine  (ANSD  2014).  The  results  show  that  55%  of  the  participants  preferred 
fragrant rice and, more interestingly, 62% preferred local rice. In our study, only 23% of the sample 
claimed that they consumed more whole-grain than before, while 53% tended to be loyal to a certain 
rice type. 
 
Female-headed households represented 17% of the sample and 89% of the women were involved in 
rice purchasing decisions. This is consistent with similar studies (Demont & Ndour 2015) and justifies 
our choice of women as target respondents for our study. Almost all the women (94%) claimed to be 
able to distinguish fragrant rice from non-fragrant rice, and 83% of them were aware of imported 
fragrant rice, i.e. the competing product analysed in this study. 
 
Households tend to purchase rice mainly on a monthly (46%) or daily (39%) basis. The bi-serial 
correlation coefficient indicates that there is a small, negative correlation between purchasing rice 
daily and the income level of the household, and a small, positive correlation between purchasing rice 
monthly  and  the  level  of  income.  Annual  per  capita  consumption  amounts  to  103  kg,  which  is 
consistent  with  the  World  Bank’s  (2013)  estimate  of  100  kg  and  similar  to  consumption  levels 
observed in Asian rice-producing countries. The sample is therefore representative and relevant to 
the purpose of our study. 
 
In  our  study,  the  77%  preference  for  broken  rice  over  whole-grain  rice  (Table  1)  confirms  that 
Senegalese as a whole have a strong preference for broken rice, which makes up 95% of the country’s 
imports (USAID 2009). The opportunity for growth of local fragrant rice in urban markets is high, 
given that 95% intended to buy it whenever available. We found strong evidence for a significant 
market  potential  for  fragrant  rice  in  Dakar;  for  example,  households  with  prior  preferences  for 
fragrant or even local rice tended to upgrade to fragrant rice, and even those who were loyal to a 
particular brand or rice type were willing to pay price premiums for fragrant rice.

Two thirds (64%) of the participants were able to correctly identify imported fragrant rice among the 
four upgrades (Table 1), and those who did tended to pay less for rice fragrance in general, although 
the effect is not significant. Akoa Etoa et al. (2016), in contrast, found that consumers who confused 
the local upgrade with imported rice tended to pay significantly higher price premiums for it.

Table 2 reports some descriptive statistics on willingness to upgrade (WTU) and willingness to pay 
(WTP) for rice fragrance. WTP values can be interpreted as the price premiums consumers are willing 
to pay on top of the price of the benchmark, which was priced at 260 FCFA (US$ 0.57) kg-1 in July 
2011. Given the mass of non-positive bids and the censored character of our WTP records, we report 
the mean of the positive bids and the mean of all bids. Based on the mean of all post-sensory bids, 
the  average  value  of  rice  fragrance  is  estimated  to  be  around  52  FCFA  (US$  0.12)  kg-1,  which 
translates into a 20% price premium relative to the price of non-fragrant rice. After being exposed to 
the visual characteristics of the rice samples, consumers’ WTU from non-fragrant rice to fragrant rice 
is  on  average  74%,  i.e.  very  consistent  with  a  USAID  (2010)  stated-preference  survey  that  was 
conducted a year before and found that 72% of consumers in Dakar preferred fragrant rice. However, 
after being exposed to the sensory characteristics of the rice samples, market shares (WTU) dropped 
substantially towards 50%. Many participants claimed that they were surprised by the good taste of 
the benchmark, a finding also reported by Demont et al. (2013a; 2013b). Since 88% of the participants 
consumed fragrant rice (Table 1), our sensory test may have exposed some consumers to a rice type 
they had never tried before. Mean positive bids varied from 91 to 117 FCFA (US$ 0.20 to 0.25)  
kg-1, with price premiums accruing to Thai Hom Mali. In general, our results show that fragrant rice 
in the urban market has more value than non-fragrant rice. Even the local fragrant rice, Sahel 329, 
repeatedly received the same WTP bid after the sensory test (Table 2).

3.2 Drivers of demand for rice fragrance 
 
The results of the double hurdle model are presented in Table 3. The first three data columns report 
the effect of variety, tasting, timing and the socio-demographic characteristics of the consumers on 
the probability to upgrade (WTU) the benchmark rice to fragrant rice, while the last three columns 
present the estimates of the determinants of WTP. We defined our variety dummies Sahel 177, Sahel 
328 and Sahel 329 such that they would be relative to imported Thai Hom Mali as the reference. This 
enables double-benchmarking these varieties against non-fragrant and fragrant imported rice. The 
insignificant coefficients for the three variety dummies in the first hurdle suggest that consumers are 
indifferent to the origin of the rice in their upgrading decision from non-fragrant to fragrant rice. 
Consistent with Table 2, after tasting we found a significant drop of 21% in market share for fragrant 
rice in favour of non-fragrant rice. Although consumers are generally willing to pay price premiums 
for fragrance relative to the upper market benchmark of imported fragrant rice, they discount local 
fragrant rice by 13 to 24 FCFA (US$ 0.03 to 0.05) kg-1, which is a marginal price discount of 4% to 
8% relative to the price of 300 FCFA (US$ 0.65) kg-1 (July 2011) for Thai Hom Mali in Dakar.

Similarly to Demont and Ndour (2015), we found no significant income effect on both WTU and 
WTP.  Poorer  households  might  consider  fragrant  rice  to  be  a  luxury  product.  However,  in  the 
literature, even the poor in developing countries are characterised as having an increasing preference 
for food quality and taste over quantity (Jensen & Miller 2008; Deaton & Drèze 2009). In Dakar, 
fragrant rice is sold in small packages of 1 kg ($1.6)1 and 5 kg ($8 to $9) in markets and supermarkets. 
Customers who cannot afford to buy 50 kg bags ($42) might only buy small packages on special

occasions  (USDA  2013;  2014).  However,  the  share  of  higher  quality  rice  is  found  to  be  rapidly 
increasing  in  rice  markets,  with  rising  price  premiums  for  quality  rice  in  developing  countries 
(Demont et al. 2012; Minten et al. 2013). Therefore, we added two variables that can serve as proxies 
for income. Indeed, households that employed a cooking housemaid or were not organised in social 
networks were more likely to upgrade or pay price premiums for fragrant rice. Employing a cooking 
housemaid is a proxy for wealth and increases consumers’ WTU to fragrant rice by 28%, while being 
organised in associations, most of them savings associations (“tontines”), is a proxy for low income 
and reduces WTP by 33 FCFA (US$ 0.07) kg-1, i.e. a price discount of 13%. We also found that larger 
households  are  more  likely  to  upgrade  and  tend  to  pay  higher  price  premiums  for  fragrant  rice. 
However the partial effect is low, with a price premium of only 3.14 FCFA (US$ 0.01) kg-1 (around 
1%  of  the  price  of  the  benchmark)  per  unit  increase  in  the  household  size.  Household  members 
involved in rice purchase decisions tend to pay 43 FCFA (US$ 0.09) kg-1 more (17% of the price of 
the benchmark) for rice fragrance, a premium that is offset by household heads. 
 
The study also shows that, despite the fact that local fragrant rice varieties were released in 2009, 
only 28% of the participants claimed to be aware of them at the time of the experiment. This suggests 
that there is still some scope for making consumers aware of these new rice products. Consumers are 
willing to upgrade to fragrant rice, whether imported or local, as differences in market share between 
origins are not significant. Those who had prior awareness of fragrant rice tend to have a 24% lower 
willingness to upgrade to it, but when they do, pay price premiums of 34 FCFA (US$ 0.07) kg-1 (13% 
of the price of the benchmark). However, those who are aware of the existence of local fragrant rice 
in the Senegal River Valley (28%, Table 1) tend to pay higher price premiums for fragrance (45 FCFA 
(US$ 0.10) kg-1; 17% of the price of the benchmark), while those with positive purchase intentions 
for fragrant Senegal River Valley rice (95%, Table 1) pay very high price premiums of 91 FCFA 
(US$ 0.20) kg-1 (35% of the price of the benchmark). Moreover, almost a quarter of the consumers 
claimed they consumed more whole-grain rice than before (Table 1), and those who do, pay higher 
price premiums for fragrance (38 FCFA (US$ 0.08) kg-1; 15% of the price of the benchmark). 
 
Households purchasing rice on a monthly or daily basis tend to be less willing to upgrade to fragrant 
rice relative to households purchasing rice on a weekly or two-weekly basis, while those purchasing 
on a daily basis tend to pay higher price premiums for it, probably due to the higher relative premiums 
for fragrance in retail. Our analysis also controls for rice stocks at home (Purchased variable), which 
negatively  affects  willingness  to  pay  for  upgrading.  We  also  find  evidence  for  ethnic  market 
segmentation; Wolof, Sereer, Pulaar, Diola and Lebou consumers were more likely to upgrade to 
fragrant rice and, except for Lebou consumers, also to pay significantly higher price premiums for it. 
Since these ethnic groups represent at least 87% of the national population (83% in our sample), this 
illustrates the sensitivity of urban Senegalese consumers to fragrant rice in Dakar and the importance 
of this market segment. This clearly shows the need to develop value chains of local fragrant rice 
varieties so that domestic rice farmers can tap into these urban markets. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In this study we assessed the competitiveness of local relative to imported rice on the market for 
fragrant rice in Dakar, the capital city of Senegal. An experimental auction approach based on the 
“endow-and-upgrade” method was used to identify the main drivers of consumers’ willingness to 
upgrade and willingness to pay for rice fragrance. The experimental results suggest that three quarters 
of consumers are willing to upgrade from non-fragrant to fragrant rice, whether imported or not. We 
found local rice to be competitive with imported rice on the market for fragrant rice in Dakar, as it 
fetched only small price discounts of 4% to 8% relative to Thai Hom Mali. The market prospects for 
local fragrant rice look good, as 95% of the participants expressed positive buying intentions for this

product, and those who do are 20% more likely to buy it while paying substantial price premiums of 
35% on top of the price of non-fragrant rice. 
 
Fragrant rice research and development programmes in Senegal require a lot of attention from policy 
makers.  To  improve  food  security,  public  rice-breeding  programmes  should  consistently  and 
sustainably include market research on consumer and farmer preferences regarding their strategic 
planning (Custodio et al. 2016). Fragrant rice value chains should target market segments that prefer 
aromatic  rice  and  can  afford  the  price  premiums  for  fragrance.  This  should  be  reflected  in  the 
production and processing segment of the value chain as a source of incentive. This also implies 
increasing the production of local fragrant rice, which will necessitate the implementation of a strong 
and  sustainable  seed-production  system  for  fragrant  rice,  along  with  the  application  of  good 
agricultural practices (GAP) to attain the yield potential of the varieties. However, with deficient 
promotion of local fragrant rice, imports of fragrant broken rice, for instance from Thailand, could 
increase as consumers’ total expenditure on rice increases (Coulibaly et al. 2015). 
 
Our  experiment  has  also  revealed  that  the  market  share  of  non-fragrant  rice  may  increase  after 
consumers are exposed to its post-cooking sensory characteristics. Policy makers and value chain 
stakeholders should not neglect the substantial market potential for high-quality non-fragrant rice 
varieties,  which  are  already  widely  available  in  the  Senegal  River  Valley  (Demont  et  al.  2013a; 
2013b).
