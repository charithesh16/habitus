is  crucial 

for  successful  collective  action.  A  prime  example 

 
Trust 
is  collective 
commercialization  of  agricultural  produce  through  producer  organizations.  We  conduct  a 
cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Senegal in which we vary the number and the type 
of smallholder farmers – members and/or leaders of local producer organizations – invited to 
a three-day training on collective commercialization. We use this variation to identify effects 
on  intra-group  trust,  both  direct  treatment  effects  of  having  participated  in  the  training  and 
spillover  effects  on  farmers  who  did  not  partake.  Looking  at  different  measures  of  trust  in 
leaders’ competence and motives  and of trust in members we find that participating in the 
training significantly enhances both trust in leaders and trust in members. For trust in leaders, 
we also find a strong spillover effect. Our findings suggest that relatively soft and non-costly 
interventions  such  as  a  group  training  appear  to  be  able  to  positively  affect  trust  within 
producer organizations.

Introduction

Rural Producer Organizations (RPOs)1 can provide smallholders in developing
countries with better access to input and output markets (Markelova et al., 2009;
Rondot and Collion, 2001; The World Bank, 2008). Acting collectively within
RPOs is often seen as an effective means to reduce transactions costs, to gain bar-
gaining power, to obtain necessary market information, and to get access to new
technologies and high value markets (Devaux et al., 2009; Poulton et al., 2010;
Stockbridge et al., 2003). While examples of successful collective action exist,
such as coffee production, grading and export in Ethiopia (Kodama, 2007), green
bean exports in Kenya (Narrod et al., 2009) and cotton production and exports in
Mali (Tefft, 2004), many RPOs in developing countries struggle to offer the type
of services that would lead to higher output prices for their members (Bernard
et al., 2008a, 2010; Fafchamps and Hill, 2005; Markelova et al., 2009). Instead of
commercializing their produce collectively, smallholders frequently opt for sell-
ing it individually to traders at the farmgate (Fafchamps and Hill, 2005).2

Whether collective commercialization takes place or not is highly correlated
with the ability to coordinate and the prevalence of trust3 within a RPO (Hill
et al., 2014; Shiferaw et al., 2011). Mistrust between farmers can even lead to
the disintegration of RPOs (Masakure and Henson, 2005). Typically, RPOs are
member-driven organizations whose success depends on their members’ partici-
pation in joint activities. Reasons for members being reluctant to participate in
collective commercialization largely play out at the intra-RPO level (Bernard and
Wouterse, 2015). First, farmers may struggle with liquidity constraints and hence

1“Producer organizations are membership-based organizations or federations of organizations
with elected leaders accountable to their constituents. They take on various legal forms, such
as cooperatives, associations, and societies” (The World Bank, 2008, p. 154). In this paper, we
analyze farmer groups in Senegal that provide members with services. Hence, they differ from
NGOs which also provide services to non-members (Bernard and Wouterse, 2015).

2This paper implicitly builds on the assumption that collective commercialization is more
efﬁcient than individual marketing. See, for example, Bernard et al. (2008b) for evidence that
cooperatives’ members achieve higher prices for their produce than non-members in Ethiopia,
Shiferaw et al. (2008) for evidence that collective commercialization achieves higher output prices
than individual sales to traditional buyers in Kenya, and Wollni and Zellner (2007) for evidence
that commercialization through cooperatives achieves higher output prices in Costa Rica. See
Section 2.2 for details about prices achieved by farmers in our sample.

3We deﬁne trust as “a particular level of the subjective probability with which an agent as-
sesses that another agent or group of agents will perform a particular action” (Gambetta, 2003, p.
277) and hence do not regard it as being a form of social capital in itself, but rather as being a
measurable link between social capital and collective action (Ostrom and Ahn, 2003).

decide against participating in collective commercialization as it involves sub-
stantial delays in payment as compared to individual farmgate sales (Fafchamps
and Hill, 2005). Second, farmers need to have sufﬁcient trust in their leaders’ mo-
tives and competences. The sales processes of collective commercialization are
typically executed by few leaders and are not transparent for members. Members
may fear to not be paid at all or that price increases that occur through bulking
will not be shared with them fairly (Buck and Alwang, 2011; Hill et al., 2014).
Third, a farmer’s decision to participate in collective commercialization is likely
to be affected by her belief about the behavior of fellow farmers. Trust in fellow
members’ and their commitment is needed to believe that the minimum num-
ber of produce will be reached for bulk sales and, hence, to decide to participate
(Bernard et al., 2014).

According to the theoretical framework provided by Ostrom and Ahn (2003),
success and failure of collective action is determined by a complex conﬁgura-
tion of various forms of social capital—trustworthiness4, networks and institu-
tions5—which enhance trust. Trust is seen as the core link between social capi-
tal and collective action. It reduces opportunistic behavior and transaction costs
(Collier, 2002; Ostrom and Ahn, 2003; Putnam, 1993). “Trust lubricates co-
operation” (Pretty and Ward, 2001, p.211). We expect that a training interven-
tion can strengthen existing horizontal and vertical networks and may even create
new ones through repeated interaction of farmers. We further expect a training
intervention to clarify the process of collective commercialization and the rules
involved and, thus, to create a common understanding of the relevant institutions.
We hypothesize that such increases in social capital will lead to a positive effect
of a training intervention on trust in members and on trust in leaders.

We conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial to test these hypotheses in
the context of RPOs in Senegal. We randomly invited members and/or leaders to
participate in a three-day training to build social capital in order to induce mem-
bers and leaders to coordinate towards successful collective commercialization.
The training itself consisted of three days of interactive discussion on the bene-
ﬁts, conduct and constraints of collective commercialization and was executed in

4The term trustworthiness refers to intrinsic motivation as an independent reason for behaving

cooperatively (Ostrom and Ahn, 2003).

5Institutions are the rules of the game that people devise (North, 1990). They specify which
actions and outcomes are required, prohibited, or permitted, and which sanctions are authorized

collaboration with GRET (a French NGO) and PINORD (a Senegalese NGO). In
all treated RPOs, a general assembly was convened shortly after the training to
discuss its content with non-participants. All participating RPOs had stated col-
lective commercialization as one of their main objectives despite facing important
difﬁculties in aggregating their members’ produce.6

We assess how this intervention affects trust in a sample of 798 smallholder
farmers from 73 RPOs. We analyze both intention-to-treat effects, i.e., the treat-
ment effect of the invitation to participate in the training, and treatment effects
of the training itself. Our main outcome variables of interest are survey mea-
sures of trust in leaders’ competence and motives and survey measures of trust
in members (Twyman et al., 2008). We distinguish between trust in leaders’ in-
tegrity, informational advantage, efﬁciency and negotiation skills, and general and
farming-speciﬁc trust in members.7 In each RPO we randomly varied the number
of members and leaders invited to the training and interviewed both invited and
non-invited individuals. This enables us to analyze (i) the average treatment effect
of whether or not a RPO was selected for training, (ii) the direct treatment effect
of whether or not an individual was selected for training, and (iii) the spillover
effect on non-treated individuals in treated RPOs.

Our results suggest a positive treatment effect of the training on measures
of both trust in leaders and trust in members. For trust in leaders, the effect is
especially pronounced for trust in their integrity and their informational advan-
tage. Moreover, results suggest a strong spillover effect on trust in leaders of
non-treated members, i.e., that the sizable positive average treatment effect is not
to be attributed solely to personal treatment. The spillover effect is especially pro-
nounced for trust in leaders’ integrity and their negotiation skills. We show that
while RPOs may face several constraints with respect to coordination towards col-
lective commercialization, a relatively simple and non-costly group training may
contribute to a substantial change in trust in leaders and trust in members and,
thus, to clearing a barrier to collective commercialization and other collective en-
deavors. Social capital is often thought to increase with use, thus, the training
may well have been the starting point for more collective endeavors to come.8

indeed had a positive effect on the quantity of produce commercialized collectively through the
RPOs.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We begin, in Section
2, by describing the institutional background of RPOs in Senegal and the issues
with collective commercialization through such organizations. In Section 3, we
describe the cluster-randomized controlled trial.
In Section 4, we develop the
hypotheses tested in this paper and describe our measures of trust. In Section 5,
we present our empirical strategy and estimates of the treatment effects on RPO-
level and, in Section 6, on individual level. We conclude in Section 7.

2 Background: RPOs in Senegal

2.1 Institutional setting

Seven out of ten rural households in Senegal are members of RPOs, and RPOs
have expanded rapidly in number and membership in the last decades. Between
1982 and 2002, the percentage of villages with RPOs rose from 8 to 65 percent in
Senegal (The World Bank, 2008). Senegal is a country with a vast array of rural
institutions in thousands of villages and with strong national-level organizations
(Bernard and Wouterse, 2015).

The history of agricultural and development policy in Senegal since indepen-
dence can be divided into two main periods: two decades of state intervention
followed by two decades of liberalization. Like in many other developing coun-
tries, the Senegalese government initiated cooperatives in the 1960s which pri-
marily dealt with the commercialization of groundnuts. The entire value chain
of agricultural production of groundnuts and cotton was organized and controlled
by state entities such as producer cooperatives that were in charge of providing
extension, inputs and credit to farmers as well as of collecting, processing and
exporting output. Farmers typically considered cooperatives as an extended arm
of the government rather than as an organization that they owned. Support of
the international community led to the creation and development of regional or-
ganizations for rural development which aimed at specializing and transforming
agricultural systems in the different agro-ecological zones. However, these or-
ganizations focused on the cultivation of a particular type of crop which was in
contrast to the reality of rural smallholders typically cultivating several types of
crops (Bernard et al., 2014; Bernard and Wouterse, 2015).

In the 1970s, this system of rural development went into crisis. Throughout

6

the country, farmers founded the ﬁrst independent farmers’ organizations to rep-
resent their own interests. In 1978, the Federation of Senegalese NGOs (FONGS)
was established to reinforce solidarity and communication among farmer groups,
to foresee their training needs and to interact with the outside world on their
behalf. Foreign stakeholders became increasingly interested in farmers’ organi-
zations as partners for development projects. In the 1980s, the new agricultural
policy which followed the near bankruptcy of the country and a bail-out deal by
the International Monetary Fund advocated the complete withdrawal of the state
from agriculture. Consequently, the government facilitated the emergence of a
new category of organizations with a more ﬂexible legal status. These groups
grew rapidly due to the support of their creation and their preferential treatment
for obtaining credit. To defend its own interests, FONGS undertook ambitious
projects at the national level such as cereal banks. In 1993, FONGS initiated the
creation of a platform (CNCR) consisting of seven national federations of farm-
ers, livestock producers, ﬁshermen, horticultural producers and rural women. Its
objective was to promote dialogue and the exchange of experience between its
members, to encourage pooling of resources and competences and to serve as
voice for the farmer movement versus the state and donors. In 1995, two other
federations joined bringing the platform’s total number of members up to about 3
million rural dwellers. In 1996, an NGO (ASPRODEB) was founded that could
disburse funds of various donors and offer services to rural producers (Bernard
et al., 2014; Bernard and Wouterse, 2015; Mercoiret, nd; Réseau des Organisa-
tions Paysannes et Pastorales du Sénégal, 2008; The World Bank, 2008).

The role, functioning and capacity of RPOs has changed signiﬁcantly with
the gradual liberalization of the agricultural sector. They have evolved towards
independent member-controlled entities capable of dealing with various kinds of
partners. Yet, these RPOs face new challenges in ensuring the commitment of
members. This is particularly true for activities related to collective commercial-
ization of agricultural output.
In fact, while RPOs remain active in input and
credit provision, their capacity to aggregate output has been weakened consid-
erably. At time of harvest, producers are now visited by private collectors and
traders. This has led to important side-selling, produce is not marketed solely
through the RPOs. As a result, RPOs are seldom able to aggregate the necessary
amount of produce to trigger economies of scale and bargaining power at time of
commercialization. This is despite isolated evidence that RPOs in Senegal can

7

in fact provide their members with proﬁtable and reliable output commercializa-
tion services. In sum, in the absence of a sufﬁcient amount of aggregated output,
RPOs are not in a position to effectively obtain higher output prices which leads
to further side-selling and a lack of interest of members for commercialization
services offered by these organizations (Bernard et al., 2014).

2.2 Collective action in Senegalese RPOs

Generally, problems of collective action arise “whenever individuals face alterna-
tive courses of actions between short-term self-regarding choices and one that, if
followed by a large enough number of individuals in a group, beneﬁts all” (Os-
trom and Ahn, 2003, p. xiv). In the context of commercialization of agricultural
produce, farmers who are organized in RPOs can choose between selling their
produce directly at the farmgate to a local trader with immediate payment and
selling it collectively through their RPO. Farmers in our sample cultivate either
groundnuts, rice, or onions as their main crop.9 While groundnut farmers primar-
ily sell their groundnuts either individually or collectively for private gains, onion
farmers have been observed to engage in joint collection and commercialization
of ﬁrewood. Rice farmers use part of their gains from selling their rice (privately
or collectively) for ﬁnancing irrigation systems.

For collective commercialization of any type of produce, the RPO’s leaders
will typically negotiate with a contract buyer who offers a higher price than the
local traders if a minimum amount of produce is sold. This quantity is typically
too large to be reached by just one individual farmer such that complying with
the contract requires coordination among the members of the RPO. Moreover,
these contracts tend to be rather discrete in the sense that they are void if a certain
threshold of aggregated produce is not met and payments are usually made some
time after the farmers delivered their produce to the RPO for collective commer-
cialization (Bernard et al., 2014). In our sample, two thirds of the farmers who
report to have sold to traders in the 2010/2011 agricultural season (March 2010
to March 2011) state that they received the payment on the day of the transaction
while only one quarter of the farmers who sold through the RPO report to have
received the payment on the day the transaction took place.

Senegalese RPOs appear to be facing signiﬁcant constraints when it comes

9There is no heterogeneity within any RPO in our sample regarding the main crops cultivated

by members and leaders.

8

to collective action in the form of collective commercialization of agricultural
produce. Although RPOs in our sample were selected based on collective com-
mercialization being one of their main objectives, only roughly one third of the
RPOs in our sample report to have engaged in collective commercialization in
the 2010/2011 agricultural season.10 On average, farmers who sold their produce
through the RPO in the 2010/2011 season achieved higher prices per kilogram
than those who sold their produce individually. Only one quarter of the farm-
ers who sold their produce individually to local traders regularly dealt with the
same traders. When asked about difﬁculties faced when selling their produce in-
dividually, only 20 percent of the respondents indicated that there were no major
problems. For the remaining respondents, the main issue was lack of transporta-
tion means to reach more lucrative markets (cited by 48 percent) followed by
insufﬁcient visits by potential buyers (17 percent), lack of knowledge about cur-
rent prices (15 percent) and lack of sufﬁcient quantity of produce to be able to
negotiate a better price (8 percent).

While lack of ﬁnancial means and technical capacities at the RPO level are
likely to be signiﬁcant constraints to collective commercialization, members’ per-
ception of collective commercialization and issues of coordination between mem-
bers also seem to represent important constraints, independent of the type of crop
to be sold collectively. Leadership has been shown to be a key element of suc-
cessful coordination within RPOs (Agrawal, 2001; Bernard and Wouterse, 2015;
Markelova et al., 2009).11 On the one hand, leaders need to have the necessary
skills for the collective marketing and relevant links to outsiders. On the other
hand, members need to trust their leaders (Arcand, 2002; Markelova et al., 2009).
In those RPOs that engaged in collective commercialization, only 44 percent of
the farmers delivered part of their produce to the RPO to be sold collectively.
Respondents state three main reasons for why they chose to sell individually in
spot market-like transactions to local traders rather than collectively through their
RPO: most ﬁnd collective commercialization to be too risky (without specify-

10We consider a RPO to be engaged in collective commercialization if at least one farmer sold

his or her main produce (groundnut, onion, or rice) through the RPO.

11A commonly found organizational structure in Senegalese RPOs involves a relatively cir-
cumscribed sub-group of members bearing more responsibilities and more inﬂuence than others.
Leadership status is often associated with traditional social roles (Arcand, 2002).

9

ing the exact nature of this risk),12 some do not believe that it offers them a better
price then selling individually, and to others collective commercialization appears
to be a complicated process that takes up too much time.13

RPOs engaging in collective commercialization differ signiﬁcantly from those
who did not engage in collective sales in the 2010/2011 agricultural season (see
Table 1).14 Their members are younger, own more motorcycles, are more likely to
have savings accounts with banks and MFIs, and have larger ﬁelds. They cultivate
groundnuts and rice more often than onions. Moreover, we ﬁnd signiﬁcantly
higher average trust levels in RPOs that engaged in collective commercialization
than in those that did not.

Farmers who contributed part of their produce to collective commercialization
in the season prior to the baseline data collection appear to be signiﬁcantly more
trusting than those who did not contribute (see Table 2). Moreover, they are
more likely to be literate than those who did not contribute, less likely to be a
member, less likely to be related to a leader, more likely to have a savings account,
have larger ﬁelds and more motorcycles, and are younger. They are also more
likely to come from ethnically heterogeneous RPOs, have been members of their
RPO for a shorter time period, are more likely to be cultivating groundnuts and
less likely to be cultivating onions. Looking at different measures for trust, we
ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive pairwise correlation between several trust measures
and an indicator for whether a RPO engaged in collective commercialization.
Similary, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive pairwise correlation between several
trust measures and individual participation in collective commercialization (see
Table 3).

12The risk inherent in collective commercialization may be categorized into two types of risk:
the price risk associated with freely working markets and the risk associated with being dependent
on others’ behavior. On the intra-RPO level, the outcome of collective commercialization depends
on the number of fellow farmers who participate as well as the competence and behavior of the
leaders involved in the transactions.

1350 percent of the respondents stated risk as a reason, 30 percent the price and 26 percent
the inconvenience (numbers do not add up to 100 percent as answers were given in free text and
each person could provide several reasons). Information on this question is only available for a
subsample of groundnut farmers.

Overall, results from this section support the idea that trust in leaders and
in members may play a signiﬁcant role in fostering collective commercializa-
tion. Aiming at enhancing trust within RPOs to encourage collective commer-
cialization, we organized a three-day training and discussion around the potential
beneﬁts and difﬁculties of coordinating towards collective commercialization in
partnership with GRET and PINORD.

Intervention

We investigate issues of intra-group coordination and trust using a sample of
Senegalese village-level RPOs for which we conducted a baseline survey in Novem-
ber and December 2011. At that time people may have assumed that there would
be subsequent activities following the survey, but no details on the intervention
were given. On the contrary, it was intentionally left unclear that there would be
an intervention for some interviewees in the future. The sample for which the
baseline survey was conducted was drawn from a dataset of 204 RPOs from 9
federations belonging to FONGS collected in 2009 from which we selected all
organizations that stated collective commercialization as one of their main pur-
poses. 73 RPOs belonging to 7 federations satisﬁed this criterion. Figure 1 shows
the location of the sampled RPOs.

We randomly assigned an invitation to the training intervention to those 73

RPOs as follows:

• 23 RPOs served as pure control group, they were not invited to participate

in the training intervention

• 50 RPOs received an invitation to participate in the training intervention

– in 12 RPOs, between one and four leaders but no members were in-

vited to the training

– in 15 RPOs, between one and four members but no leaders were in-

vited to the training

– in 23 RPOs, between one and four members and between one and four

leaders were invited to the training

In each of the treated RPOs, at least two persons received an invitation. Invitees
were randomly selected from lists of members and leaders obtained from the

2009 survey. In all treated RPOs, a general assembly was convened shortly after
the training to discuss its content with non-participants. To be able to consider
both direct as well as spillover effects, we interviewed both invitees as well as
non-invited individuals. In each RPO, 10 non-invited individuals were randomly
selected for interviewing purposes.

The treatment and interview assignments were not fully respected in all RPOs.
In some RPOs, more than four members (leaders) were invited. There were also
instances where some invitees did not participate in the training, where more
than the intended number of individuals participated in the training, or where
the distribution of members and leaders was not fully respected. Moreover, the
number of actually interviewed individuals (including invitees) ranges from 4
to 16 per RPO instead of the targeted 10 to 18. Furthermore, due to missing
information on outcome variables, we have to drop 8 individuals belonging to 7
RPOs from our sample. All in all, we work with a sample of 798 interviewed
individuals consisting of 150 invitees, 447 non-invited individuals from treated

15

RPOs, and 201 individuals from control RPOs.15

The intervention consisted of a three-day training conducted in January 2012.
During the training, all participants were treated the same, i.e., members were
not treated differently from leaders. The purpose of the training was to create
awareness of the (potential) advantage of working together towards commercial-
ization of agricultural produce and highlight particular group dynamics that are
conducive to collective action. In terms of content, role plays, simple games and
group exercises were to demonstrate the advantages of working together in terms
of the beneﬁts that can be generated and the costs that can be saved. Particular
focus was put on sharing information and increasing transparency. Participants
were encouraged to communicate the message they took away from the training
to non-trained fellow farmers from their RPO upon return. One part of the train-
ing was to put together a plan for how these messages can be communicated and
discussed with other group members.

The training sessions were organized in three modules, one for each day: (1)
the potential and pitfalls of collective commercialization, (2) coordination within
organizations—the role of communication in collective commercialization, and
(3) motivation for coordination—members and leaders.16 An endline survey was
conducted 2 to 4 weeks after the training.

In this paper we focus on estimating immediate effects of the intervention on
intra-group relations. We do not capture long-term effects which would also have
been interesting considering that trust may need time to grow. We cannot fully
preclude a courtesy bias, i.e., that the respondents give the socially desirable an-
swer when reporting higher trust levels after the intervention. However, baseline
and endline data were collected via independent interviewers. They were not per-
ceived as being related to GRET and PINORD, the organizations implementing
the training, and were ignorant of the treatment status of RPOs as well as indi-
viduals. This separation of implementation and data collection should minimize
the risk of a courtesy bias. If we found a spillover effect on trust of non-invited
individuals in treated RPOs, we would be even less concerned about a courtesy
bias. Indeed, our ﬁndings suggest that the intervention had an impact on trust of
non-invited individuals (see Section 6), thus mitigating concerns related to such

15See Appendix B.1 for more details on the one-sided noncompliance. The distribution of
RPOs and farmers by intended and actual treatment status as shown in Tables B.1 and B.2 in
Appendix B.1 underline that treatment assignment is balanced which we further assess in Table 4.

Notes: We report averages and standard deviations for the full sample of 73 RPOs, averages in the subsamples of RPOs
in treatment and control group and results of two-sample t tests with the null of equal means in control and treatment
group at baseline.
a Information on these variables is only available for 68 out of 73 RPOs of which 45 belong to the treatment group and
23 to the control group.
b Information on this variable is only available for 69 out of 73 RPOs of which 47 belong to the treatment group and 22

To ensure that the assignment of the treatment is independent of any baseline
characteristics, we run a series of balancing tests relating RPO’s invitations to
participate in the training to individual and RPO-level characteristics. In Table 4
we report means of individual and RPO-level characteristics in invited and non-
invited RPOs at baseline as well as results from two-sample t tests with the null of
equal means in invited and non-invited RPOs. Results suggest that the treatment

17

allocation is fully independent of average baseline trust levels,17 and a range of
further covariates. Treatment and control group only differ signiﬁcantly with
respect to the average walking distance of the farmers to the RPO’s storage site.18
Multivariate tests for equality of means of baseline trust in invited and non-invited
groups reveal no signiﬁcant differences between treatment and control groups.19
Within invited RPOs, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences in average baseline trust
when comparing invitees and non-invitees (see Table 5 for details on binary trust
measures and Table B.4 in Appendix B.2 for details on ordinal trust measures).

17See Table B.3 in Appendix B.2 for balancing tests using ordinal trust measures.

4 Experimental design

4.1 Hypotheses

Ostrom and Ahn (2003) provide a theoretical framework for analyzing issues of
collective action which can be applied to analyzing collective commercialization
as an example of collective action. Success and failure of collective action is de-
termined by a complex conﬁguration of various factors which they categorize as
forms of social capital. They argue that the different forms of social capital—
trustworthiness, networks and institutions—enhance trust which they see as the
core link between social capital and collective action. Figure 2 shows the rela-
tionships between the forms of social capital, trust, and collective action.

Figure 2: Social capital, trust, and collective action.
(Ostrom and Ahn, 2003, p. xvii)

Trust reduces opportunistic behavior and, thus, transaction costs (Collier, 2002;
Putnam, 1993). Applied to the context of collective commercialization in RPOs,
farmers who are organized in RPOs need to be trustworthy and sufﬁciently con-
nected with each other, and the RPO needs to provide adequate institutions for
trust to be prevalent within the RPO and for collective commercialization to be
successful. Trust in leaders allows the trusting farmer to commit to commercial-
ization despite the risk of loss if the leaders do not behave as the trusting farmer
expected. Trust in members allows the trusting farmer to commit to commercial-
ization despite the risk of loss if the fellow farmers do not participate in the joint
endeavors as expected by the trusting farmer.

If the training intervention increases the different forms of social capital, it

20

will enhance trust and ultimately lead to more successful collective commercial-
ization and potentially other collective endeavors in treated RPOs. Putnam (1993)
distinguishes between horizontal networks bringing together individuals of equiv-
alent status, e.g. fellow members or fellow leaders, and vertical networks bringing
together individuals from different hierarchical levels, e.g. members and leaders.
Dense horizontal networks with the capability of efﬁciently transmitting infor-
mation across individuals create incentives to behave in a trustworthy manner.
Repeated interactions among individuals are seen as a sign of robust networks
(Ostrom and Ahn, 2003). We expect that the training intervention strengthens
existing horizontal and vertical networks and may even create new ones through
repeated interactions of farmers. Put differently, we expect the intervention to
have a positive effect on participating leaders’ trust in other leaders and on partic-
ipating members’ trust in other members through tightening existing bonds and
creating new ones during and after the joint ﬁeld trip to the training. Similarly,
in RPOs where both members and leaders participate, the training may increase
trust between leaders and members through strengthening and/or creating vertical
networks. We hypothesize that such increases in social capital will materialize in
a positive treatment effect on trust in members and on trust in leaders.

Both networks and institutions change the incentive structure of individuals
with institutions creating incentives for both the trusting and the trusted party to
behave in a trustworthy manner (Ostrom and Ahn, 2003). We expect that the
intervention clariﬁes the process of collective commercialization as one form of
collective action and the rules involved and, thus, creates a common understand-
ing of the relevant institutions. In other words, trained members (leaders) may
obtain a better understanding of leaders’ (members’) role and position which may
increase members’ (leaders’) trust in leaders (members) even if no leaders (mem-
bers) are present during the training. Further, the intervention may also create
positive spillover effects, i.e., increase non-participants’ trust in leaders and mem-
bers. Participants may convey their newly acquired understanding of leaders’ and
members’ role and position to non-participants during the general assembly held
shortly after the training. We hypothesize that such increases in social capital will
again materialize in a positive treatment effect on trust in members and on trust
in leaders.

4.2 Measures of trust

We consider six survey measures of trust capturing different aspects of trust
within a RPO that we consider to be important for successful collective com-
mercialization. We distinguish between trust in leaders and trust in members.

Measuring general trust20 in unknown others based on the standard trust ques-
tion used in the General Society Survey (GSS)21 or the World Values Survey22 has
been challenged on the grounds that it is unclear what this question actually mea-
sures (Beugelsdijk, 2006; Durlauf, 2002; Sobel, 2002; Yamagishi et al., 1999).
Results from relating general trust in strangers as stated in the survey question to
behavior in experimental trust games are mixed.23

However, survey measures are commonly used for studying trust as a col-
lective property of organizations, i.e., for studying trust in known others. In the
management literature, the perception of the characteristics of signiﬁcant others
within the working context is looked at for studying trust between and within or-
ganizational levels (Tschannen-Moran and Hoy, 2000). We borrow from this lit-
erature to asses how characteristics of members and leaders are perceived within
the RPO context.24 For trust in leaders, we distinguish between trust in their mo-
tives and trust in their competence with regard to collective commercialization.
Trust in leaders’ motives refers to a farmer’s beliefs that the leaders are other-
regarding or not, i.e., that the leaders have motives to perform an action beneﬁcial
to others or not. Trust in leaders’ competence refers to a farmer’s beliefs that the
leaders have credible expertise (Buck and Alwang, 2011; Twyman et al., 2008).

20General trust is a baseline expectation of others’ trustworthiness (Yamagishi, 2001).
21“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too

careful in dealing with people?”—“Most people can be trusted.” or “Can’t be too careful.”

22“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be
very careful in dealing with people?”—“Most people can be trusted.” or “Need to be very careful.”
23Glaeser et al. (2000) ﬁnd in a sample of students at Harvard University that trust as stated in
the survey has no predictive power for trust elicited from the trust game, but for trustworthiness.
For a representative sample of the German population, Fehr et al. (2002) ﬁnd a relation of trust
as measured in the survey and experimental trust, but not for trustworthiness. Sapienza et al.
(2007) ﬁnd that trust as stated in the survey predicts experimental trust for a sample of MBA
students at the University of Chicago. For a heterogeneous Dutch sample, Bellemare and Kröger
(2007) ﬁnd no signiﬁcant link between trust as measured in the survey to neither experimental
trust nor trustworthiness. Naef and Schupp (2009) have developed a new survey measure for trust
in strangers that is more precise that the GSS question and have used it in the German Socio-
Economic Panel showing that survey and experimental measures of trust are connected in the
sense that the trust game measures trust in strangers.

24See Kramer (1999) and Möllering et al. (2004) for reviews of the conceptualization of trust
in organizational theory and the beneﬁts of and conditions for trust in organizational systems. See
Seppänen et al. (2007) for a review of the empirical research of inter-organizational trust.

22

We consider four aspects of trust in leaders asking respondents to which extent
they agree with the following statements:

(1) “The RPO’s board is capable of negotiating better prices for our produce

than I am capable of myself.”

(2) “Board members defend the RPO’s interests and their own interests in equal

measure.”

(3) “If the RPO’s board says that I can achieve better prices if I wait a little,

they do so because they have adequate information.”

(4) “If I invest my money or my produce in the RPO, it will be used efﬁciently.”

For trust in members, we consider both general trust and trust speciﬁc to the
farming context asking respondents to which extent they agree with the following
statements:

(5) “The majority of people in my RPO are trustworthy.”

(6) “I can trust the people from the RPO to look after my ﬁeld during an ab-

sence of two months.”

Originally, all trust measures are recorded on a four-point Likert-type scale.
The items to choose from are (1) “Do not agree at all”, (2) “Do not really agree”,
(3) “Agree”, and (4) “Fully agree”. However, given that the average trust levels
at baseline are well above 3 for all measures of trust (see Table B.4 in Appendix
B.2), we use binary variables as regressands in the empirical analysis which are
equal to one if respondents fully agree with one of the above statements.

Hence, for trust in leaders, we create a binary variable negotiation equal to one
if the respondent fully agrees with the ﬁrst statement, a binary variable integrity
equal to one if the respondent fully agrees with the second statement, a binary
variable information equal to one if the respondent fully agrees with the third
statement, and a binary variable efﬁciency equal to one if the respondent fully
agrees with the fourth statement. For trust in members, we create a binary variable
general equal to one if the respondent fully agrees with the ﬁfth statement, and a
binary variable farming equal to one if the respondent fully agrees with the sixth
statement.

Moreover, we create two comprehensive indices of trust. For trust_sum we
take the sum over the six binary trust measures such that values of trust_sum

23

range from 0 to 6.25 For trust_factor we run a factor analysis with the six binary
trust measures. Values of the resulting index of trust range from -1.74 to 0.81.26

Notes: We report averages of different trust measures in treatment group (T—treatment group) and control group (C—
control group) at baseline (BL—baseline) and endline (EL—endline) as well as p-values of two-sample t tests with the
null of equal means.

Descriptive evidence suggests a positive impact of the training intervention on
intra-RPO trust. Table 6 reports two-sample t tests with the null of equal means
in baseline and endline for treatment and control group. Moreover, we report
two-sample t tests with the null of equal means for treatment and control group in
both baseline and endline. Treatment RPOs report higher levels of average trust

25trust_sum has a mean of 4.08 and a standard deviation of 2.35.
26trust_factor has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

24

at endline compared to baseline for all measures of trust. We observe statistically
signiﬁcant differences between average trust in leaders’ negotiation skills and
their informational advantages. While we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences between
average trust in treatment and control group at baseline, treatment RPOs report
signiﬁcantly higher levels of trust at endline compared to control RPOs for trust
in leaders’ negotiation skills and their integrity, for general and farming-speciﬁc
trust in members, and for both comprehensive trust indices.27

5.1 Empirical strategy

To further study the intervention’s impact on trust, we estimate treatment effects
on RPO level. To account for the one-sided noncompliance28 that may be related
to individual and RPO-level characteristics, we ﬁrst present estimations of the
intention-to-treat effect, i.e., the treatment effect of the invitation to participate
in the training intervention. We draw on the random assignment of the invita-
tions (and the time dimension of our data) to identify the causal effect of such an
invitation at the RPO level on our different measures of trust.

In our main regressions we will allow for ﬁxed effects to pick up differences
in unobservable characteristics between individuals and/or RPOs. Although treat-
ment was randomly assigned, the relatively small number of RPOs may entail
some small sample imbalances in observed and/or unobserved characteristics. To
be on the safe side, we include ﬁxed effects. Since our analysis is based on two
time periods, ﬁxed effects regressions are identical to taking ﬁrst differences in a
regression with no further covariates.29 Thus, we estimate:

∆trustg = γ0 + γ1RP O_invitationg + νg

(1)

where ∆trustg = trustg,t=1 − trustg,t=0 is the difference between average trust
27For descriptive evidence on the intervention’s impact on ordinal trust measures see Table B.4

in Appendix B.2.

28Participation in the training intervention was voluntary among those who were invited, but
no one from the control RPOs had access to the training intervention. For details on the one-sided
noncompliance see Appendix B.1.

29Double differencing not only removes biases in an endline comparison between the treatment
and control group resulting from permanent differences, but also biases from a comparison over
time in the treatment group resulting from time trends that are unrelated to the intervention. The
key identifying assumption (common trend assumption) for the estimation of a causal treatment
effect is that trends in development of trust would on average be the same in treatment and control
groups in the absence of the training intervention (Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009).

25

in RPO g at endline t = 1 and baseline t = 0 and RP O_invitationg is a binary
variable equal to one if at least one member or leader of RPO g has received an
invitation to participate in the training intervention. νg is a random disturbance
term for RPO g. Given the random assignment of the invitations, the estimated

coefﬁcient(cid:98)γ1 is our main coefﬁcient of interest, the causal effect of the invitation

to the training on average trust. It captures both the treatment effect for those
individuals who have personally been invited (direct treatment effect) and those
who have only been interviewed (spillover effect) which we will disentangle in
Section 6.

For illustrative purposes, we also report results of level regressions, i.e., of
regressions without ﬁxed effects. Using endline data, we estimate the following
linear model:

trustg,t=1 = β0 + β1RP O_invitationg + εg

(2)

where trustg,t=1 is a measure of average trust in RPO g at endline t = 1 and

RP O_invitationg is deﬁned as above. Hence, (cid:98)β1 is our main coefﬁcient of in-

terest in this model, the average causal effect of the invitation to the training on
average trust. εg is a random disturbance term for RPO g.

To address concerns with regard to statistical inference in the small cross-
section sample of 73 RPOs, we provide both OLS standard errors and classical in-
ference as well as randomization inference. For the intention-to-treat estimations
based on equations (1) and (2), we implement permutation tests which do not
rely on asymptotic approximation and whose properties are hence independent of
sample size.30 Randomization inference is based on the sharp null hypothesis of
no treatment effect for anybody and provides exact ﬁnite sample inference. We
conduct randomization inference by forming 9000 randomly drawn permutations
of the randomization vector for the 73 RPOs and calculating the regression esti-
mates using regressions as presented in equations (1) and (2). For each outcome
of interest, this provides the ﬁnite sample distribution of the estimated treatment
effect under the null of no effect, upon which we base our two-sided test of zero
effect. For recent applications of this approach see for example Bloom et al.

30Randomization inference is typically only done for intention-to-treat estimations. Random-
ization inference in the instrumental variable regression context would required modeling assump-
tions since the compliance type is not known for all observations, i.e. the counterfactual value of
RP O_training if RP O_invitation was changed.

26

(2013) and Landmann and Frölich (2015).

In next step, we estimate the effect of treatment on the treated, i.e., the causal
effect of the training intervention on those who participated, using the randomly
assigned invitations as an instrumental variable for training received. We esti-
mate:

trustg,t=1 = δ0 + δ1RP O_trainingg + υg
∆trustg = η0 + η1RP O_trainingg + ωg

(3)
(4)

where RP O_trainingg is a binary variable equal to one if at least one mem-
ber or leader of RPO g participated in the training which we instrument for by
RP O_invitationg. The ﬁrst stage regression coefﬁcient is 0.88. Since both the
treatment variable and the instrument are binary, the instrumental variable re-
gression is identical to the Wald (or LATE) estimator. The estimated effects are
identical to those of equations (1) and (2) divided by 0.88. We therefore report
randomization inference only for the reduced form regressions, estimates only
differ by this scaling factor. The F statistic from the ﬁrst-stage regressions is
351.60, the adjusted R2 is 0.6937. trustg,t=1 and ∆trustg are deﬁned as above.
υg and ωg are random disturbance terms for RPO g. Thus, the estimated coef-

ﬁcients(cid:98)δ1 and(cid:98)η1 are our main coefﬁcients of interest, the causal effects of the

training on average trust in those RPOs who participated.

5.2 Regression results

In Table 7 we report estimated treatment effects on average trust. In panel A we
report results from regressions using endline data while panel B shows results
from ﬁrst differences estimations. We present intention-to-treat effects based on
reduced form regressions as speciﬁed in equations (1) and (2), and we present
treatment on the treated effects based on instrumental variable regressions as
speciﬁed in equations (3) and (4).

The regression results conﬁrm the descriptive evidence presented above. An
invitation to the training signiﬁcantly increases both comprehensive trust mea-
sures. The estimated treatment effect becomes even larger when looking at the
effect of the training itself on average trust. In detail, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly pos-
itive intention-to-treat effect of between 11 and 13 percentage points for average
trust in leaders’ negotiation skills, their integrity and their informational advan-

27

tage.31 We further ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive intention-to-treat effect of between
10 and 13 percentage points for both measures of trust in members. These posi-
tive treatment effects increase to 12 to 15 percentage points when considering the
effect of the training itself.

We run several robustness checks to conﬁrm these results. First, we enlarge
the model in ﬁrst differences by allowing for onion-speciﬁc and rice-speciﬁc time
trends and by controlling for the number of invited/trained persons per RPO.32
Qualitatively, results remain unchanged compared to the model in ﬁrst differ-
ences without covariates. Second, we follow McKenzie (2012) who argues that
large improvements in power can arise when estimating treatment effects via an
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) estimation compared to using the difference-
in-differences speciﬁcation. We estimate the ANCOVA speciﬁcations without
covariates, with controls for onion and rice cultivation and with a control for the
number of invited/trained persons per RPO. Results are similar to those from the
difference-in-differences estimations and robust to controlling for onion and rice
cultivation and to controlling for the number of invitees/participants. For details
on these robustness checks see Appendix B.3.

31Recall that baseline trust averages range between 0.63 for trust in leaders’ negotiation skills

and general trust in members and 0.71 for trust in leaders’ integrity (see Table 4.)

32Note that when including covariates to the model in ﬁrst differences, it is no longer equivalent

to a ﬁxed effects model.

6 Treatment effects at individual level

In this section we present treatment effects of the (invitation to the) training on
trust based on individual-level regressions permitting us to disentangle the effect
of having personally been invited from a potential spillover effect on non-invited
farmers within treated RPOs. We start by assessing descriptively whether trust
has evolved between the baseline and endline survey and whether it has evolved
differently in treatment and control groups. Table 5 reports two-sample t tests
with the null of equal means in baseline and endline for invitees, non-invitees in
invited RPOs and for non-invitees in non-invited RPOs. Moreover, we report two-
sample t tests with the null of equal means for invitees and non-invitees in invited
RPOs in both baseline and endline and for non-invitees in invited and non-invited
RPOs in both baseline and endline. Invitees report higher levels of trust at endline
compared to baseline for all measures for trust. This difference is statistically
signiﬁcant for all measures except for trust in leaders’ integrity. Further indication
of a positive direct treatment effect comes from the comparison of invitees with
non-invitees from invited RPOs. While we observe no signiﬁcant difference at
baseline, we observe signiﬁcant differences for all measures of trust in leaders
but negotiation at endline. We also ﬁnd descriptive evidence for a positive spill-
over effect within invited RPOs. Comparing non-invitees from invited and non-
invited RPOs, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences at baseline. At endline, however,
non-invitees in invited RPOs report signiﬁcantly higher trust levels for all trust
measures but efﬁciency compared to non-invitees from non-invited RPOs.

6.1 Empirical strategy

To further study spillover effects and direct treatment effects, we estimate:

∆trustig = α0 + α1spillover_invitationig + α2personal_invitationi

+τig

(5)

where ∆trustig = trustig,t=1 − trustig,t=0 is the difference between trust of
person i in RPO g at endline t = 1 and baseline t = 0, spillover_invitationig is
a binary variable equal to one if some member or leader from RPO g other than
person i has received an invitation, personal_invitationi is a binary variable
equal to one if person i has received an invitation to participate in the training

30

intervention, and τig is a random disturbance term for individual i in RPO g.

Hence, the estimated coefﬁcient(cid:99)α1 captures any potential spillover effects while
(cid:99)α2 captures the effect of having personally been invited.

Again, we also estimate the causal effect of the training using an instrumental

variable strategy. We estimate:

∆trustig = θ0 + θ1spillover_trainingig + θ2personal_trainingi + κig

(6)

where spillover_trainingig is a binary variable equal to one if some member
or leader from RPO g other than person i has participated in the training and
personal_trainingi is a binary variable equal to one if person i has partici-
pated in the training intervention. We instrument for spillover_trainingig and
personal_trainingi using RP O_invitationg and personal_invitationi.33 The
F statistic from the ﬁrst-stage regression of spillover_trainingig amounts to
174.18, the adjusted R2 to 0.6062. For personal_trainingi the F statistic is
240.95 and the adjusted R2 is 0.6403. κig is a random disturbance term for in-
dividual i in RPO g, and ∆trustig is deﬁned as above. Hence, the estimated

coefﬁcient (cid:98)θ1 captures any potential spillover effects while (cid:98)θ2 captures the effect

of having personally been trained.

To gain further insights into spillover effects, we also estimate regressions
as speciﬁed in equation (6) separately for subsamples containing only members
or only leaders. For the subsample of members, we further split the spillover
effect by treatment type, i.e., by whether only members were treated, only lead-
ers, or both. In these regressions, we instrument for spillover_trainingig and
personal_trainingi by RP O_invitationg and personal_invitationi.34 We in-
strument for spillover_training_OLig, spillover_training_OMig, spillover_
training_LMig and personal_trainingi using RP O_invitation_OLg, RP O_
invitation_OMg, RP O_invitation_LMg and personal_invitationi. The highly

6.2 Regression results

In Table 8 we report estimated treatment effects on individual trust. We present
intention-to-treat effects based on reduced form regressions as speciﬁed in equa-
tion (5), and results from instrumental variable estimations as speciﬁed in equa-
tion (6). Results hint at a signiﬁcantly positive treatment effect of having per-
sonally received an invitation. In detail, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant personal intention-
to-treat effect of 13 to 20 percentage points for all individual trust measures but
trust in leaders’ negotiation skills.35 These effects increase to 15 to 24 percentage
points when considering the treatment effect of the training.

To gain further insights into spillover effects and direct treatment effects, we
rerun estimations as speciﬁed in equations (5) and (6) on subsamples contain-
ing only members or only leaders. Results are presented in Tables 9 (members)
and 10 (leaders).
In Table 9 we present intention-to-treat effects based on re-
duced form regressions on a subsample of members as speciﬁed in equation (5)
and results from instrumental variable estimations on a subsample of members
as speciﬁed in equation (6). For members we ﬁnd both a signiﬁcantly positive
personal treatment effect as well as a signiﬁcantly positive spillover effect. In
particular, we ﬁnd signiﬁcantly positive direct treatment effects of 19 to 20 per-
centage points for trust in leaders’ integrity and their informational advantage as
well as a signiﬁcant personal intention-to-treat effect of 18 percentage points on
general trust and farming speciﬁc trust in members. For trust in leaders’ nego-
tiation skills, their integrity, and their informational advantages, results appear
to be indicating a signiﬁcantly positive spillover effect of 15 to 16 percentage
points. This may be attributed to untrained members believing that trained lead-
ers have gained relevant skills (trust in competence) and that trained leaders are
less likely to privately capture rents (trust in motives). We further split these
spillover effects into spillovers in RPOs where only leaders were invited (partic-
ipated), RPOs where only members were invited (participated) and RPOs where
both leaders and members were invited (participated). Results presented in Table
9 hint at the spillover effects in trust in leaders being most pronounced in RPOs
where either only leaders or only members were invited (participated). Given the
small sample size in the subsample containing only leaders (N=168), results for
this subsample present inconclusive (see Table 10).

35The average baseline trust levels range from 0.62 for general trust in members to 0.71 for

trust in leaders’ integrity.

We run similar robustness checks on the full sample of 798 farmers as we
did for the treatment effects on RPO level. First, we enlarge the model in ﬁrst
differences by allowing for onion-speciﬁc and rice-speciﬁc time trends and by
controlling for the number of invited/trained persons per RPO. Qualitatively, re-
sults remain unchanged compared to the model in ﬁrst differences without co-
variates. Second, we estimate ANCOVA speciﬁcations without covariates, with
controls for onion and rice cultivation and with controlling for the number of
invited/trained persons per RPO. Results are similar to those from the difference-
in-differences estimations and robust to controlling for onion and rice cultivation
and to controlling for the number of invitees/participants. For details on these
robustness checks, see Appendix B.4.

Besides having an impact on intra-RPO trust in both members and leaders,
the training intervention may have also affected farmers’ perception of their RPO.
Data about the true and perceived level of information is scarce in our data set.
We have information on how well farmers know their own RPO, namely whether
they believe to know how many members their RPO has. This question was only
included in the endline survey. In Table 11 we report the percentage of farmers
stating that they know the size of their RPO by intended treatment status. On
average, farmers from invited RPOs feel signiﬁcantly better informed about the
size of their RPO than farmers in the control group. This difference is dominated
by farmers who were personally invited, but also non-invited farmers in the treat-
ment group fare better than farmers in the control group. Apparently, the training
was able to provide farmers with information they were previously lacking. In
line with this, we ﬁnd that farmers in invited RPOs appear better informed about
the potential beneﬁts of an efﬁciently working RPO, and also a signiﬁcant differ-
ence when looking at the evaluation of the actual RPOs (see Table 11). Farmers
from invited RPOs are signiﬁcantly more conﬁdent than farmers from the control
group that their RPO can help to overcome hindrances that they encounter when
selling individually.

people who stated to not be facing any constraints when selling individually did not answer these questions.

7 Concluding remarks

Although many positive examples from both developed and developing countries
exist, many RPOs still struggle to offer the type of commercialization services
that would lead to higher output prices for their members. In this paper, we have
argued that trust in leaders’ motives and competence as well as trust in members
are crucial for successful collective commercialization as a form of collective
action.

We conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial in the context of RPOs in
Senegal. We randomly invited members and/or leaders to participate in a three-
day training to induce members and leaders to coordinate towards successful col-
lective commercialization. The training itself consisted of three days of interac-
tive discussion on the beneﬁts, conduct and constraints of collective commercial-
ization. In all treated RPOs, a general assembly was convened shortly after the
training to discuss its content with non-participants.

We ﬁnd a positive treatment effect of the training on both trust in leaders and
trust in members. For trust in leaders, the effect is especially pronounced for
trust in leaders’ integrity and their informational advantage. Moreover, results
suggest a strong spillover effect on non-treated members for trust in leaders, i.e.,
that the sizable positive average treatment effect is not to be attributed solely to
personal invitation. This may be attributed to untrained members believing that

37

trained leaders have gained relevant skills (trust in competence) and that trained
leaders are less likely to privately capture rents (trust in motives). These results
are robust to the inclusion of different covariates and to different speciﬁcations of
the underlying model.

These ﬁndings suggest that relatively soft and non-costly interventions such
as a group training appear to be able to positively affect intra-RPO trust and the
farmer’s perception of coordination towards successful collective action. Further-
more, social capital is often thought to increase with use, i.e., it is thought of
as being self-reinforcing when reciprocity connects people leading to increased
trust and conﬁdence (Pretty and Ward, 2001). Thus, the training may well have
been the starting point for more collective endeavors to come. Bernard et al.
(2014) show for a subsample of groundnut farmers that the training intervention
indeed had a positive effect on the quantity of produce commercialized collec-
tively through the RPOs. While being the motivation for this research, collective
commercialization is only one dimension along which smallholders can beneﬁt
from the training intervention. Smallholders can beneﬁt from the newly gained
intra-RPO trust in many ways; RPOs also engage in various other joint activities
aside from collective commercialization all of which require trust among mem-
bers and leaders. For example, RPOs lend farming equipment or provide credit
to their members. In case of the rice farmers, there is good case to believe that
they beneﬁt from increased trust when jointly managing irrigation systems. With
well-developed social capital, local water-users’ groups are able to use existing
resources more efﬁciently than individuals working alone or in competition. The
same holds true for forest management practiced by some RPOs (Pretty and Ward,
2001).

B Supplementary analyses

In this appendix we provide additional analyses on selected issues discussed in
the paper.

B.1 One-sided noncompliance

While invitations were distributed according to the randomization protocol, one-
sided noncompliance regarding training participation was frequent. While none
of the control RPOs participated in the training, some of the invited RPOs chose
not to participate. From those RPOs that did participate, not always the exact
farmers that had personally been invited to the training participated, sometimes
others came to the training instead. In the empirical analysis, we deal with this by
estimating intention-to-treat effects, i.e. the treatment effect of the invitation, and
by estimating treatment effects of the training by instrumenting for the participa-
tion using the invitation as instrument. Tables B.1 and B.2 provide details on the
one-sided noncompliance.

In Table B.1 we provide details based on the distribution of invitations while
we consider actual participation in the training in Table B.2. In Table B.1 we
report the intended distribution of 798 interviewed farmers from 73 RPOs on 50
invited and 23 non-invited RPOs, and the intended distribution of 597 interviewed
farmers from 50 invited RPOs on 150 invitees and 447 non-invitees. Further, we
report how the invitations were allocated to RPOs in which only leaders (OL),
only members (OM), or both leaders and members (LM) were invited. We report
both the number of farmers and the number of RPOs (in parentheses).

In Table B.2 we report the actual distribution of 798 interviewed farmers from
73 RPOs on 44 treated and 23 non-treated RPOs, and the distribution of 534
interviewed farmers from 44 treated RPOs on 142 trained and 392 non-trained
farmers. Further, we report how the participation was allocated to RPOs in which
only leaders (OL), only members (OM), or both leaders and members (LM) were
trained. We report both the number of farmers and the number of RPOs (in paren-
theses).

B.2 Descriptive statistics for ordinal measures of trust

Originally, responses to all trust survey questions were recorded on a four-point
Likert-type scale. The items to choose from are (1) “Do not agree at all”, (2)
“Do not really agree”, (3) “Agree”, and (4) “Fully agree”. However, given that
the average trust levels at baseline are well above 3 for all measures of trust, we
use binary variables as regressands in the empirical analysis which are equal to
one if respondents fully agree with one of the asked statements. Here, we report
additional descriptive statistics for trust measures using the original coding.

In Table B.3 we show that the assignment of the invitations is also independent
of ordinal trust measures at baseline. The two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
with the null of equal means in control and treatment groups at baseline reveal no
signiﬁcant differences.

Descriptive statistics reveal a positive impact of the intervention on ordinal
measures of trust. In Table B.4 we report results of two-sample Wilcoxon rank-
sum tests with the null of equal means in ordinal trust in baseline and endline for
invitees, non-invitees in invited RPOs and for non-invitees in non-invited RPOs.
Moreover, we report two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with the null of equal
means in ordinal trust for invitees and non-invitees in invited RPOs in both base-
line and endline and for non-invitees in invited and non-invited RPOs in both
baseline and endline. Results are similar to those when using binary trust mea-
sures (see Table 5). Invitees report higher levels of trust at endline compared to
baseline for all ordinal measures for trust. Further indication of a positive di-

50

rect treatment effect comes from the comparison of invitees with non-invitees
from invited RPOs. While we observe no signiﬁcant difference at baseline, we
observe signiﬁcant differences for all ordinal measures of trust in leaders but ne-
gotiation_ordinal at endline. We also ﬁnd descriptive evidence for a positive
spill-over effect within invited RPOs. Comparing non-invitees from invited and
non-invited RPOs, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences at baseline. At endline, how-
ever, non-invitees in invited RPOs report signiﬁcantly higher trust levels for all
ordinal trust measures but efﬁciency_ordinal compared to non-invitees from non-
invited RPOs.

B.3 Robustness checks for treatment effects on RPO level

We run several robustness checks to conﬁrm our main ﬁndings reported in Section
5.

First, we enlarge the model in ﬁrst differences (see equations (1) and (4)) by
allowing for onion-speciﬁc and rice-speciﬁc time trends (see Table B.5) and by
controlling for the number of invited/trained persons per RPO (see Table B.6).36
Table B.5 shows results for regressing changes in trust on a binary treatment in-
dicator, a binary indicator for rice cultivation, a binary indicator for onion culti-
vation and a constant. We report both intention-to-treat effects as well as results
from two-stage regressions using invitation status as an instrument for training
participation. We use RP O_invitation as instrument for RP O_training in Ta-
ble B.5. The highly signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcient between these two vari-
ables amounts to 0.8354. Qualitatively, results remain unchanged compared to
the model in ﬁrst differences without covariates. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive
treatment effect of the training of 12 to 13 percentage points on trust in leaders’
integrity and their informational advantage. For the reduced form regressions, we
provide conventional inference and randomization inference. We ﬁnd a similar
pattern as we did in our main analysis, p-values for the randomization inference
are smaller than those for the conventional inference for all regressions. Hence,
for reasons of clarity, we refrain from presenting randomization inference in the
following.

Table B.6 shows results for regressing changes in trust on a binary treatment
indicator, the number of invited farmers and a constant. We also run a speciﬁca-
tion where we consider the number of invited members and the number of invited
leaders. Again, we report both intention-to-treat effects as well as results from
two-stage regressions using invitation status as an instrument for training partici-
pation. We use RP O_invitation and number_invited as instruments for
RP O_trained and number_trained (highly signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients
range between 0.6467 and 0.9054) as well as RP O_invitation, number_invited_
members and number_invited_leaders as instruments for RP O_trained,
number_trained_members and number_trained_leaders in Table B.6 (highly
signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients between 0.2458 and 0.9045). Qualitatively,
results remain unchanged compared to our main results. The number of in-

36Note that when including covariates to the model in ﬁrst differences, it is no longer equivalent

to a ﬁxed effects model.

52

vited/trained persons has no additional effect on trust outcomes on top of the
effect of the binary treatment measure. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive intention-
to-treat effect of 14 to 16 percentage points on trust in leaders’ integrity and their
informational advantage.

Second, we follow McKenzie (2012) who argues that large improvements in
power can arise when estimating treatment effects via an Analysis of Covariance
(ANCOVA) estimation compared to using the difference-in-differences speciﬁca-
tion. While difference-in-differences fully corrects for potential baseline imbal-
ances between treatment and control groups, which may be inefﬁcient if base-
line data have little predictive power for future outcomes, ANCOVA reduces the
variance of the treatment effect estimator by conditioning on a variable that is
correlated with the outcome of interest. ANCOVA includes the mean value of
the outcome over all available pre-treatment rounds as a covariate when estimat-
ing the treatment effect. In our case of one pre-treatment and one post-treatment
survey, it includes the baseline value of the outcome as a covariate.

Thus, we regress trust at endline on a constant, a binary treatment indicator
and on trust at baseline. We estimate these regressions without covariates, with
controls for onion and rice cultivation (see Table B.7) and with control for the
number of invited/trained persons per RPO (see Table B.8).

We use RP O_invitation as instrument for RP O_training in Table B.7 and
RP O_invitation and number_invited as instruments for RP O_trained and
number_trained in Table B.8. Results are similar to those from the difference-
in-differences estimations. Without covariates, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive
intention-to-treat effect of 10 to 12 percentage points for trust in leaders’ negoti-
ation skills, their integrity, and their informational advantage. We ﬁnd a (signiﬁ-
cantly) positive intention-to-treat effect of 11 percentage points on both measures
of trust in members. The treatment effect of the training itself is again slightly
larger. These results are robust to controlling for onion and rice cultivation and to
controlling for the number of invitees/participants.

B.4 Robustness checks for treatment effects on individual level

To conﬁrm our main ﬁndings on treatment effects on individual level presented
in Section 6, we run similar robustness checks as we did for the treatment effects
on RPO level.

First, using the full sample of 798 farmers, we enlarge the model in ﬁrst differ-
ences (see equations (5) and (6)) by allowing for onion-speciﬁc and rice-speciﬁc
time trends (see Table B.9) and by controlling for the number of invited/trained
persons per RPO (see Table B.10).37 Table B.9 shows results for regressing
changes in trust on a binary treatment indicator for personal treatment, a binary
indicator for treatment of others, a binary indicator for rice cultivation, a binary
indicator for onion cultivation and a constant. We report both intention-to-treat
effects as well as results from two-stage regressions using invitation status as an
instrument for training participation. We instrument for spillover_training and
personal_training using RP O_invitation and personal_invitation as instru-
ments.38 Qualitatively, results remain unchanged compared to the model in ﬁrst
differences without covariates. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive effect of having
personally been invited of 13 to 18 percentage points on trust in leaders’ integrity
and their informational advantages as well as on both measures of trust in mem-
bers. The direct treatment effect of the training is again slightly larger.

Table B.10 shows results for regressing changes in trust on a binary treatment
indicator for personal treatment, a binary indicator for treatment of others, the
number of invited farmers and a constant. We report both intention-to-treat effects
as well as results from two-stage regressions using invitation status as an instru-
ment for training participation. We use RP O_invitation, number_invited and
personal_invitation as instruments for spillover_training, number_trained
and personal_training. The highly signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients range be-
tween 0.2700 and 0.9004. Qualitatively, results remain unchanged compared to
the model in ﬁrst differences without covariates. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive
effect of having personally been invited of 19 to 22 percentage points on trust in
leaders’ integrity and their informational advantages as well as on both measures

37Note that when including covariates to the model in ﬁrst differences, it is no longer equivalent

to a ﬁxed effects model.

38The highly signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients are 0.5702 for spillover_training and
RP O_invitation, 0.2700 for personal_training and RP O_invitation,
-0.3509 for
personal_invitation and spillover_training and 0.7993 for personal_invitation and
personal_training.

of trust in members. The direct treatment effect of the training is again slightly
larger.

Second, we estimate ANCOVA speciﬁcations. We regress trust at endline on
a constant, a binary treatment indicator for personal treatment, a binary indicator
for treatment of others, and on trust at baseline. We estimate these regressions
without covariates, with controls for onion and rice cultivation (see Table B.11)
and with controlling for the number of invited/trained persons per RPO (see Ta-
ble B.12). In the regressions reported in Table B.11 we use RP O_invitation and
personal_invitation as instruments for spillover_training and personal_training.
For table B.12 we use RP O_invitation, number_invited and personal_invitation
as instruments for spillover_training, number_trained and personal_training.
Results are similar to those from the difference-in-differences estimations. With-
out covariates, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly positive treatment effect of having per-
sonally been invited of 13 to 23 percentage points for all measures of trust and
indication for a spillover effect of 11 to 13 percentage points for trust in leaders’
negotiation skills and their integrity. The treatment effect of the training itself is
again slightly larger. Results are again robust to controlling for onion and rice
cultivation and to controlling for the number of invitees/participants.
