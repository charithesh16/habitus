EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A. Introduction and Purpose  

This report examines the scaling up of a package of innovations in the irrigated rice seed sector in 
Senegal through commercial pathways from 2010 to 2015.1 This package includes: capacity to certify 
quality rice seed; good agricultural practices (GAPs); the capacity of the value chain in key areas to 
supply inputs, services and downstream market linkages; and perhaps most importantly, financial 
innovations. This study focuses only on the irrigated rice value chain in the Senegal River Valley (SRV) 
region and does not examine the scaling up of Nerica rice varieties in rainfed areas of Senegal. It is one 
of five studies looking at successful scaling up of agricultural innovations in developing countries. The 
United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Bureau for Food Security (USAID/BFS) 
has commissioned the E3 Analytics and Evaluation Project to conduct these studies as part of its efforts 
to scale up the impact of the Feed the Future (FTF) food security initiative. The goal of these studies is 
to produce lessons learned and ultimately guidance for USAID and its country Missions interested in 
integrating a commercial pathways approach to scaling up into their FTF project designs, procurements, 
and implementation. This overall research is designed to provide a better understanding of what types of 
innovations and country contexts are best suited to scaling up through commercial pathways, and what 
activities, strategies, and support are necessary to facilitate that successfully. 

B. Background  

The Senegal River Valley is by the far the largest area of irrigated rice production in Senegal, currently 
around 60,000 hectares (ha) with a potential of at least 120,000 ha. Irrigation was first put in place 
during the colonial period and expanded from independence through the early 1990s. With structural 
adjustment in the early 1990s, the Government of Senegal (GOS) disengaged from its primary role in 
providing inputs, purchasing output, setting prices, and delivering extension and other support services, 
though it continued to provide credit to farmers who qualified. Disengagement by the state led to the 
breakdown of the rice value chain, especially extension support, processing, and downstream linkages to 
formal markets. As a result, up until GOS emergency measures in light of the 2007-2008 food crisis, 
there was a steady decline in the surface area of irrigated rice that was cultivable and the percentage of 
potentially cultivable area that was actually planted.  Perhaps more importantly, a number of factors 
prevented farmers from realizing the full yield potential of Sahel rice varieties introduced in the mid-
1990s and widely adopted over the ensuing five years.   

Nonetheless, even during this period when the SRV accounted for a fraction of total surface area 
cultivated in rice, it made up a disproportionately large share of total national rice production. Sahel rice 
was introduced in the mid-1990s and widely adopted in the SRV by 2000. However, yields were 
significantly below potential until scaling up of a package of innovations was significantly “completed” 
between 2010 and 2016. During this period the GOS, USAID, and other donors worked together to 
rehabilitate and strengthen the irrigated rice value chain. This study focuses on those efforts led by the 
USAID-financed Economic Growth Project (PCE), which was part of the FTF initiative to scale up a 

                                                      

1 Sahel varieties were initially developed in the early 1990s by Africarice and other international research institutes.  They were 
bred to be appropriate for the climatic conditions of the Sahel e.g. heat, low rainfall, salinity, while generating much higher yields 
than indigenous varieties. At the time of their initial introduction they had yield potentials of 10 metric tons per hectare, with 
average yields of 6-7 mt/ha, much higher than indigenous varieties. The three key varieties introduced at that time were Sahel 
108, 201 and 202. Sahel 108 was targeted for the dry season when short duration is important for enabling farmers to double-
crop. Sahel 201 and Sahel 202 are medium duration and therefore targeted for use in the wet season. Sahel 201 was introduced 
for high yield and moderate tolerance to salinity and Sahel 202 for high yield with good grain quality. More recent Sahel strains 
introduced since 2005 remain suitable for the region with yield potentials of 10-12 mt/ha.

package of innovations. This involved promoting and facilitating adoption of a mix of improved 
agricultural practices and rehabilitating and strengthening the rice value chain and relevant aspects of the 
rice market system. The package ultimately scaled was not introduced in its entirety in 2010, but 
identified iteratively as binding constraints became apparent in the course of efforts to support the 
sector as a whole. 

Prior to the intervention of PCE and its donor partners, most farmers were growing one of three Sahel 
rice varieties. However as there was no system of seed certification in place, farmers used either saved 
seed of those varieties or seed produced by seed multipliers of often low quality. Most rice was grown 
only in one season, the rainy season (hivernale), even though yields were lower than in the dry, hot 
season (principally because of lower costs as less irrigation is needed). Machinery services for land 
preparation and harvesting were well established in that most farmers were aware of them, though for 
the majority of farmers actual use of mechanical services was minimal due to limited availability, high 
costs, and lack of credit.  All farmers already preferred to use fertilizer, but whether they did so in 
practice, or used the full recommended amounts, was again dependent on access to banking credit.  

Access to credit was and remains central to a relatively capital-intensive form of agriculture (about CFA 
500-600,000 per ha or $1000/ha).  Until recently, almost all credit was supplied by the state-owned 
agricultural bank, Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole du Sénégal (CNCAS).  Yet in most years 
significantly less than half of farmers had access to credit, in large part because of their inability to repay 
previous credit.  Even farmers who received credit were often not able to harvest and especially plant 
rice on a timely basis because of delays in approval or disbursement of bank credit. As a result, average 
yields ranged between 4.9 and 6 metric tons per hectare (mt/ha) between 2005 and 2010 for hivernale 
(rainy, winter season) rice, whereas potential yields were 10–12 mt/ha,2 depending on the variety.  
Moreover, because of the near collapse of many of the larger rice mills, almost all processing (dehulling) 
was done by local mills that had neither the economic incentive nor the capacity to clean or sort rice by 
quality. Rice processed by local millers was below the quality to compete with imported rice in urban 
markets, so this surplus rice was sold at lower prices in local markets or to informal buyers to be sold in 
nearby regions.  

C. Characteristics of Scaling  

The story of scaling up of Sahel rice is atypical in several ways. First, maximum potential scale was and 
remains constrained by the extent of irrigation infrastructure. Second, from the beginning the SRV 
produced a marketable surplus of rice, and thus the producers who were the target of scaling up always 
had something of a commercial orientation, even if many consumed the majority of their own 
production. Third, Senegal has been and remains a huge rice importer, so there has always been a huge 
potential market for domestic rice, assuming it could compete with imported rice. Fourth, almost all of 
the institutions needed for a viable commercial rice value chain already existed in the SRV as of 2010, 
even if many were weak or barely functioning. The same was true for the relevant technology and 
knowledge of GAPs, with the important exceptions of key financial innovations and large, reliable seed 
certification process.  Fifth, all rice grown in the SRV is irrigated, substantially mitigating the impact of 

                                                      

2 In farmer interviews conducted for this report, some farmers reported getting 8,9,10 mt/ha in the dry season, consistent with 
yield potential found in agricultural research stations.  For the latter, see, for example, the chapter, “Potential yield of irrigated 
rice in African arid environments” by M. Dingkuhn and A. Sow, in Applications of Systems Approaches at the Field Level. pp 79-
99, Springer Volume 2: Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Systems Approaches for Agricultural 
Development, held at IRRI, Los Baños, Philippines, 6–8 December 1995 and “Simulation of potential yields of new rice varieties 
in the Senegal River Valley” by Vries, M.E. de; Sow, A.; Bado, V.B.; Sakane, N.S. in: Improving soil Fertility Recommendations in 
Africa using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) edited by Kihara, J., Fatondji, D., Jones, J.W.,

adverse weather events, which are the primary source of risk to farmers and buyers. Finally, while 
government subsidies have proved to be important in other cases of agricultural scaling up, they were 
particularly comprehensive in the PCE case. 

The policy environment in Senegal played a key role in scaling up, both as a driver of scaling and creating 
a supportive context for scaling activities. Senegal experienced a huge increase in imported rice prices in 
2007–2008 as well as difficulty getting the necessary import quantities because of export bans by major 
rice exporters like China, India, and Thailand. Senegal was and remains heavily reliance on imports of 
this staple food, with imports accounting for 75 percent or better of national consumption.  In response, 
the GOS subsequently adopted a policy of rice self-sufficiency. This translated programmatically into 
substantial increases in the size and scope of subsidies to multiple aspects of the rice sector, direct 
purchases for strategic reserves and state agencies, and an active policy of soliciting donor support for 
irrigation rehabilitation and new investment. Particularly important were government policies that de 
facto guaranteed good returns to rice farmers by effectively setting paddy prices well above production 
costs. These prices also served as a key benchmark that could be used as the basis for financial 
innovations.  

In this context, USAID and other donors chose to support the rice sector in the SRV. USAID’s PCE 
took the lead. PCE adopted an adaptive management and virtuous circle approach to reviving the rice 
value chain. Through this approach, PCE identified the immediate obstacles to increased production, 
prices, and sales, and promoted and facilitated the adoption of innovations to meet each obstacle, e.g. 
producing during the saison chaud (hot dry season) when farmers could generate higher yields with 
lower risks of pest or rain damage, or even growing during both seasons. When these efforts faced new 
constraints and limitations as the scale of production expanded, it promoted and facilitated the adoption 
of innovations those in turn: the production of certified seed; mechanization services; crop insurance 
and other financial innovations; and quality process. Where those innovations were not already present 
at small scale, it brought them in from other countries, often combining them in creative ways and 
adapting them to the SRV context, or even innovated de novo. This was particularly the case with 
financial innovations. Taken as a whole, the two key elements to this approach to innovation and scaling 
were to: (1) address supply and demand issues simultaneously; and (2) increase both quality and 
quantity. In other words, PCE worked both on “push” factors to increase yields, area planted, 
production, and quality, and on “pull” factors to increase demand.  

All of these efforts were complemented by substantial investments in road and irrigation infrastructure 
by the World Bank, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the French Agency for Development, and 
the Korea International Cooperation Agency, among others. Finally, the GOS also put through three 
important policies that helped increase the supply of credit and market size. They provided debt 
forgiveness for farmers and processors in 2014 and made additional capital available to the agricultural 
bank, CNCAS, to increase the supply of commercialization and equipment credit. The GOS required 
rice importers to purchase domestic rice in proportion to their imports, effectively guaranteeing the 
competitiveness of domestic rice against cheap foreign imports. 

These activities took a few years to put into place and have an effect. Thus while scaling efforts began in 
2009–2010 by the GOS and then donors, there was almost no increase in area, yield, production, or 
quality until 2013–2014. At that point the cumulative effects of these multiple efforts reached critical 
mass in both scale and scope, along with the equally important debt forgiveness of 2014. 

The three greatest sources of increase in yields and production that occurred after 2014 were: (1) the 
shift from hivernale to saison chaud planting or double cropping; (2) improved access to certified seed, 
and; (3) better adherence to a crop calendar (i.e., timeliness in land preparation, planting, and

harvesting).  Adoption and scaling of all three was facilitated by financial innovations that improved 
access to credit.  

More generally, in terms of scaling up strategy, the key aspects that underlay the success of PCE’s scaling 
up were: 

  Using a push-pull approach by helping producers to increase yields, production, and quality, 

while also increasing market demand by facilitating linkages to processors and distributors and 
strengthening those downstream institutions. 

  Kick starting private upstream and downstream investment through subsidies, risk mitigation, 

and market facilitation. PCE’s support for agricultural machinery leasing through Locafrique and 
innovating crop insurance with the GOS are examples. 

  Translating this push/pull and kick starting into a virtuous spiral that by 2014–2015 had become 

increasingly self-generating.  

  Aligning the incentives for farmers, banks, processors, machinery services, and wholesalers so 

that everyone makes money. In some cases in Senegal, this has been complicated by GOS-
induced distortions of prices and margins at various stages of the value chain. 

  Addressing and, where possible, lowering risk for key actors. This was particularly true for 

banks and the CNCAS. PCE addressed risk through the innovations of contractualization, crop 
insurance, and the use of a warehouse receipts system.  

D. Lessons Learned  

The Sahel rice value chain case has many important and positive lessons for scaling up of agricultural 
innovations through commercial pathways. The principal lesson from this case is that scaling up may not 
involve introducing one new technology like new rice seed varieties. Multiple innovations may be 
required to complement new seed varieties, animal breeds, etc. to fully realize the potential benefits for 
yield, production, and food security, let alone scale, sustainability, and poverty reduction. It needs to be 
accompanied by technical assistance to encourage the adoption of GAPs. The entire value chain needs 
to be in place.   

The second lesson is that scaling is multi-dimensional, and time is an often overlooked dimension that 
can affect both intensive and extensive scaling.  New technology and practices impact the ability of 
farmers to complete the various activities of the crop cycle at the optimal times. Scaling improves as 
farmers develop the ability to plant two crops per year, in some cases on the same land, and in a timely 
way. Scaling up over space, i.e., greater area, is not the only way to go, and in this case was less 
important, at least to date.  

Context can play a key role in scaling up. Irrigation already existed, seriously mitigating risk to all parties, 
and almost all rice farmers had a commercial orientation and were accustomed to using improved seeds, 
fertilizer, and other inputs; employing machinery services; and selling on commercial markets. The 
majority of rice farmers were already organized into farmers’ organizations, usually “hydraulic unions” 
or other groups around irrigation, which greatly facilitated provision of inputs, extension services, 
market linkages, and technical assistance. World and domestic prices for rice have been consistently high 
since the food crisis of 2008, making a strong business case for irrigated rice.  

Even when scaling through commercial pathways, the public sector can and often does play a significant 
and necessary role. In the SRV, PCE emphasized wherever possible commercial pathways. Nonetheless, 
GOS support played a key role through subsidies on inputs, credit, insurance, and purchases of 
machinery. GOS policy improved profitability significantly for farmers and lowered risks changing the 
risk-return tradeoff through regulating prices, supporting demand for domestic rice, and the role of

parastatals in agricultural credit and insurance. Arguably, GOS intervention in agricultural credit and 
insurance, machinery services, etc. and an overall policy stance of encouraging rice self-sufficiency has 
helped crowd in the private sector through both a demonstration effect and an implicit ‘guarantee” on 
investments in the sector. As of this writing, the private sector is now the dominant force in machinery 
services and has a growing share of agricultural credit. Without these policies and programs, scaling up 
of the package of innovations by PCE and others to increase irrigated rice production in the SRV would 
have been, much more difficult, expensive, time consuming, and arguably impossible. It is important to 
note that, at least in this case, GOS subsidies appear to be fiscally sustainable for the foreseeable future. 
At the same time, the GOS-facilitated price setting has distorted incentives, especially for wholesalers 
and processors. Exaggerated and inaccurate GOS production and yield statistics have adversely affected 
planning by rice farmers and processors.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

A. Background and Context of This Report 

The United States Agency for International Development’s Bureau for Food Security (USAID/BFS) and 
the Agency’s country Missions have been implementing the Feed the Future (FTF) food security initiative 
since 2010. In many cases, innovations developed and introduced at a small scale have since gone to 
scale or are in the process of doing so. Yet at the same time it appears that some innovations that 
potentially could have gone to scale have not done so, have not reached their full scale potential, or are 
not fully sustainable at scale.  

There are many reasons for this unfulfilled potential, such as a substantial focus on achieving the 
immediate outcomes and objectives defined in an activity solicitation and award/agreement with an 
implementing partner. However, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that one of the reasons is that 
how to scale up through commercial pathways is often not well understood or incompletely integrated 
into activity designs, procurements, and implementation plans. In other words, it appears that 
USAID/BFS and Missions could do more in both scaling and sustainability by using commercial pathways. 

In this context, USAID/BFS has commissioned the E3 Analytics and Evaluation Project3 to conduct and 
synthesize approximately five case studies to better understand how commercial pathways have been 
used successfully in the scaling up and sustainability of agricultural innovations in developing countries. 
The goal of this overall study is to produce lessons learned and ultimately guidance for USAID/BFS and 
Missions interested in integrating this scaling up approach into activity designs, procurements, and 
implementation. A particularly important goal is to develop a methodology that will allow USAID and its 
implementing partners: (a) to estimate the speed and level of adoption by farmers; (b) to identify the 
time and resources required to create the institutional foundations and enabling environment that would 
allow for a transition to commercially driven and/or spontaneous scaling up and diffusion; (c) to identify 
critical levels of initial adoption that would allow for such a transition; and (d) to provide for general 
benchmarks to monitor progress and success in creating the foundations for and a transition to 
commercially driven and/or spontaneous adoption and scaling. 

This overall study is designed to address five research questions: 

1.  Are there models using commercial innovation and growth mechanisms for bringing new 

agricultural technologies to scale in FTF countries? 

2.  What are the essential characteristics of innovations, value chains, and other spaces for 

identifying where commercial innovation growth and diffusion models are appropriate for 
reaching potential scale? 

3.  What determines the shape of the S-curve 4(e.g., size of critical mass of adopters, speed and 
timing of technology adoption and diffusion, peak levels of scale reached), and how can these 
factors be estimated? 

                                                      

3 The E3 Analytics and Evaluation Project is implemented by team lead Management Systems International, in partnership with 
Development and Training Services (dTS) and NORC at the University of Chicago. 
44 The S shaped curve is a curve commonly used to characterize the pathway over time of the number of adopters of new 
innovations, based on the path breaking work of Everett Rogers and others in the diffusion of innovation. These researchers 
found that empirically adoption can be thought of as a normal distribution, a few very early adopters, a large number of early 
and middle adopters, and then a decreasing number of later adopters.  When this normal distribution is graphed against time, it 
takes the shape of an S.

4.  What types of activities are appropriate to implementing or facilitating a commercial scaling 

pathway? Examples may include strengthening value chains and distribution mechanisms, using 
media and other communication forms, and leveraging and strengthening social networks and 
channels. 

5.  What are the implications of achieving scale and sustainability using commercial scaling pathways 
for USAID’s project designs, procurement mechanisms, planning, budgeting, cost/benefit analysis, 
and monitoring and evaluation of FTF programs? 

B. Purpose of This Report 

This report examines the successful scaling up of a package of innovations to improve irrigated rice 
production in the Senegal River Valley (SRV) region. High-yielding Sahel rice varieties were first 
introduced in 1994 and widely adopted by farmers in the SRV over the next five years. This was 
accompanied by a withdrawal or disengagement of the public sector in supporting irrigated rice 
production as part of structural adjustment policies. As a result, the introduction of the Sahel varieties 
was not accompanied by adoption of good agricultural practices (GAPs), and many key parts of the 
irrigated rice value chain declined in quality, capacity, or both. As a result, the potential impact on yields 
and production of Sahel rice, not to mention national food security, was never fully realized. Efforts to 
realize this potential were initiated by the Government of Senegal (GOS) in the midst of the world food 
crisis of 2007-2008. The GOS commitment to move towards food self-sufficiency led to USAID creating 
and financing the Projet Croissance Economique (PCE) which, from 2010-2015, in collaboration with 
other donors, introduced various innovations to fill gaps in, strengthen and rehabilitate the irrigated rice 
value chain. This study focuses on the 2010–2015 period and PCE’s efforts in particular. 

C. Methodology Used 

The approach developed by the review team for conducting these case studies is grounded in the 
spaces, drivers, and pathways analytical framework developed by Hartmann and Linn5 and the scaling up 
framework authored by Cooley and Kohl of Management Systems International (MSI)6. These 
frameworks detail the roles in which spaces, drivers, and pathways contribute to successful scaling. The 
term space is multidimensional and encompasses the fiscal/financial, political, policy (legal and 
regulatory), organizational, socio-cultural, agro-ecological, partnership,7 and learning components that 
could affect scaling. Drivers are those factors or actors that move an innovation from pilot towards 
scale, including the individuals or organizations that lead the scaling up effort, their motivation and 
incentives, and how these interact with the characteristics of the innovation itself and the spaces or 
context. Pathways are the sector used to take the innovation to scale: the private and public sectors, 
donors, and other third parties or some combination thereof. This study assesses the respective roles 
played by each sector, with a special emphasis on the role of the private sector, i.e., the commercial 
pathway, as that is the primary focus of this research.  

Within this framework, the review team examined the following components in terms of their role in 
scaling up the innovation:

  Characteristics of the innovation: The package of components needed to be adopted; 

knowledge and physical input requirements for effective adoption and implementation; cost, 
complexity, and sophistication required; changes needed, if any, in farmers’ existing agricultural 
practices; and the relationship to adoption of other innovations, whether complementary, 
substitutes, or pre-requisites. 

  Adoption drivers and results over time and space: The reasons for adoption; variation in the 

degree of adoption and other patterns; socio-economic and demographic characteristics; and the 
role of different information sources in affecting adoption.  

  Business case for the innovation: The costs, risks, and returns of adopting, producing, 

marketing, and distributing the innovation (or innovation package) relative to the motivations and 
incentives of potential adopters and other private actors in the value chain. 

  The external context or spaces: In the case of irrigated rice in the Senegal River Valley, a review 

of the documents collected narrowed the relevant spaces to: the policy enabling environment; the 
input supply chain; the downstream market; access to credit and insurance;; and institutions and 
partnerships. The review team determined that the role of gender, was at best marginally relevant 
to scaling up in this case and therefore these issues are not discussed in this case. (The agro-
ecological space is covered in the background section). 

  Scaling up strategy and activities: In rice in Senegal, there were a number of complementary 

scaling strategies in place at the same time; those of the GOS for food security, those of donors to 
support the rice sector, and that of PCE in particular, the lead organization in this case. While the 
objectives of these actors remained fairly constant, their strategy and activities change over time 
based on experience and binding constraints as they appeared. Indeed, this is a notable conclusion of 
this study that strategy needs to be adaptive. In this context, this report focuses primarily on PCE’s 
strategy and activities to: improve farmers productivity and scale; address gaps or otherwise 
strengthen the market system and external context; and facilitate other actors both private and 
public sector, to drive or support the scaling up process, including the state-owned agricultural bank 
and insurance agency, rice millers, and agricultural machine leasing companies. 

  Potential scale of adoption (the market space): The number of farmers who do or can grow 

rice given agro-ecological conditions; the effect that the innovation may have on the potential 
number of farmers growing rice or the area of rice planted; the implications of full-scale adoption 
for the overall production of rice, its absorption by the market, its impact on rice prices, and the 
profitability of growing rice. 

The methodology for this case study involved four data collection techniques: documents reviews (DR), 
key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), and analysis of quantitative data from 
secondary sources (QDSS). These approaches were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data 
from a diverse and large number of stakeholders associated with the rice value chain and the large 
enabling environment of Senegal agriculture. The sources and key spaces and drivers for the data 
collected are summarized in Table 1. Each cell notes whether relevant data was provided for a particular 
topic, ranked on a scale of 1 (X) to 4 (XXXX) as to the importance and utility of the information 
gathered. Four (4) represents most important.

The data collection took place during a three-week period in January 2016 in Dakar and the major cities 
and towns along the SRV from Saint Louis to Matam. The majority of rice production in that region is 
located within 10 km of the river valley. The review team spent six working days conducting field 
research (KIIs and FGDs) along this route, stopping in all the major commercial towns along the way: 
Richard Toll, Ross Bethio, Podor, and Dagana. This allowed for a diversity of farmer experience across 
the region in terms of proximity to markets, different types of irrigation infrastructure and systems, and 
different quality of agro-ecological micro-zones for growing rice.

During the three-week period, the review team was able to interview a large number of stakeholders. 
This included seven FGDs with rice farmers from a variety of public, village, and private irrigation 
schemes, agricultural research organizations involved in rice breeding (e.g., AfricaRice, ISRA), and several 
large-scale rice processors. The team met multiple times with relevant GOS ministries, parastatals, and 
consultative bodies, including Programme National d’Autosuffisance en Riz (PNAR, which coordinates 
and implements the overall national rice self-sufficiency policy), Société d’Aménagement et d’Exploitation 
des Terres du Delta du Fleuve Sénégal et des Vallées du Fleuve (SAED, which is in charge of building and 
maintaining public irrigation infrastructure and providing extension support), Agence Natonal de Conseil

Agricole et Rural (ANCAR), Direction Régionale du Développment Rural (DRDR, Ministry of 
Agriculture central departments in charge of extension), and the central statistical office. In addition to 
meeting with USAID staff and its PCE/Ntaal Mbay team in both Dakar and the SRV, the review team also 
met with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) team which has been heavily involved in 
improving the quality of rice processing. 

The review team was able to gather some quantitative data on rice production and cultivation from 
Ntaal Mbay (the successor project to PCE), SAED, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and the PNAR. 
SAED and Ntaal Mbay provided data in several Excel spreadsheets, which the review team used to 
create a number of time series (e.g., on production, area planted, and yields) that form the basis for 
much of the statistical analysis presented below. The team complemented its quantitative analysis with 
an exhaustive document review, especially of a number of studies that PCE commissioned and PCE’s 
annual reports.  

D. Structure of the Report 

Section II of this report provides background information on irrigated rice cultivation in the SRV. It 
covers the history of the introduction of new rice varieties beginning in the mid-1990s amidst the 
withdrawal of the GOS from an active role in the rice sector, the decline of the rice value chain 
between 1995 and 2008, and the shift in the policies of the GOS towards targeting rice self-sufficiency. 

In the review team’s other case studies, Section III specifies the technology being scaled. However, in 
this case Sahel rice varieties, narrowly defined, were already at scale,8 and though PCE introduced some 
new varieties after 2010—Sahel and others—that was one of its least successful activities. Instead what 
was being “scaled” was a package of innovations. This package, which was developed over time in 
response to challenges as they arose and/or were identified, included both a number of GAPs and 
various innovations to strengthen, rehabilitate or otherwise fills gaps in the value chain. In this case, for 
the purposes of exposition only, the former are presented in Section II while those pertaining to the 
value chain are described in Section III. Section III also assesses the business case for Sahel rice 
production by farmers and other actors in the rice value chain. Given the extensive subsidies from the 
GOS for multiple aspects of rice production, it could be that scaling was an artificial construct of these 
subsidies and not really commercially sustainable.  

Section IV looks at the scale that this package of innovations, as embodied in the potential for irrigated 
rice production in the SRV, has and could have reached as the value chain recovered, in terms of levels 
of adoption along with their impacts on yields and production levels.  It looks at the issue of whether 
there were potentially any demand constraints on an increase in the production and supply of rice (e.g., 
adverse price effects as a result of increased production of irrigated rice).  

Section V describes the status of the value chain at the beginning of scaling efforts post-2008. It identifies 
where there were gaps or weaknesses constraining scaling (i.e., whether there was adequate space for 
scaling up). It then goes on to discuss what PCE and others did to create sufficient space and relieve 
existing constraints, and the success of those efforts. Subsections here include:  

  The production and certification of quality rice seed.  
  The downstream pathways and institutions for farmers to store, process, and sell rice and 

market linkages.  

                                                      

88 According to Africarice, “The proportion of the total area under the Sahel varieties in the region increased from 3% in 
1995/96 to 72% in 2000/2001.”  See Africarice, “Irrigated Varieties.  Improved Varieties for Irrigated Rice Farming in Africa” 
http://www.africarice.org/warda/irrigated.asp  By 2000, Sahel 108 had reached 100% adoption.

  The complementary inputs space, including credit, insurance, and mechanization. 
  The policy and political space (i.e., the policies, laws, and regulations that affect, support, and 

constrain irrigated rice production in the SRV). 

Section VI quantifies scaling up over time and space in terms of the impact of the value chain activities 
on the area, yields, and productivity of Sahel rice in the SRV.  

The “Conclusions” and “Lessons Learned” sections focus on addressing the overall research questions: 
the characteristics of the innovation, context, and strategy that facilitated or hindered scaling up and 
sustainability. Particular emphasis is given to the role of commercial actors versus the omnipresent 
public sector, and the generalizability of the Senegalese Sahel rice case to other countries, value chains, 
and innovations. 

E.  Team Composition 

This review was conducted by Dr. Richard Kohl of MSI. Dr. Kohl is an economist and internationally 
recognized expert on scaling up, and has been working with USAID/BFS and Missions in improving 
scaling up strategies for FTF programs and innovations for the past two years. Additional research and 
logistical support was provided by Professor Katim Toure, a Senegalese national and university professor 
with expertise in agriculture and the irrigated rice value chain in particular. Extensive home office 
support was also received from Gwynne Zodrow, a technical manager and monitoring and evaluation 
expert with MSI.  

II. BACKGROUND ON RICE IN SENEGAL 

Senegal is a small country in Francophone West Africa, bordering on both the Atlantic Ocean and the 
Sahel. Like many developing countries, agriculture accounts for a large share of employment and a small 
share of GDP. Between 2003 and 2007, prior to the start of scaling, the share of agriculture in GDP 
fluctuated between 6.7 and 8.3 percent.9 Rice is the staple cereal and is eaten at least twice daily by 
most Senegalese households; however, because of the country’s historical poverty, the Senegalese 
historically purchased cheaper rice (e.g., broken rice). While some urban, higher-income households 
have developed a taste (and the means) for unbroken rice, aromatic varieties, and other higher-priced 
quality and varieties, broken rice remains the preference of most Senegalese, especially in rural areas.  

Senegal is the second largest rice importer in Africa, ahead of Côte d'Ivoire and 
behind Nigeria. Senegal's imports reached 1,113,000 MT in 2005, with net imports 
estimated at 854,000 MT [before declining during the food crisis]. Consumers’ preference 
is for 100 percent broken rice originating from Asia, mainly Thailand and India…. Per 
capita rice consumption continues to grow and is estimated at 70 to 75 kilograms and 
total annual consumption is estimated at 700,000 MT. Local rice production meets about 
20 percent of the country's needs and 30 percent of this production is used for subsistence. 
In 2005/06, local production of rice paddy was estimated at 265,000 MT.10

A. Geography and Seasonality  

Rice is grown almost exclusively by smallholders and emerging farmers; there is no large-scale 
commercial production of rice. Most rice is grown either in the Casamance—the part of Senegal south 
of the Gambia—in areas around Velingara, Goudomp, Kolda, and Bounkiling. Rice in the Casamance is 
mostly rainfed. Irrigated rice is found almost exclusively in the SRV. While as of 2010 the SRV accounted 
for only about one-third of total cultivated surface area (around 35,000 ha out of 108,000 nationally), it 
accounted for almost two-thirds of national rice production (214,000 metric tons (mt) out of 339,000 
mt) because of much higher productivity. According to the PNAR, average yield in the SRV was 6.1 
mt/ha in 2010, compared with 1.7 mt/ha in rainfed areas.11  

This yield advantage is reinforced by the fact that there are two seasons in the SRV, the saison hivernale 
(wet, cooler, rainy winter season) and the saison chaud (hot, dry, summer season). In the saison chaud, 
as there is no rainfall, crops require irrigation throughout the season, which goes from planting from 
mid-February and mid-March to harvesting in June-July. Planting in the saison hivernale is in June/July and 
harvesting from October through December. The hivernale was historically the season when most rice 
is grown in the SRV, despite the fact that yields have been, and remain, higher in the saison chaud, 
primarily because it was cheaper as less irrigation and associated pumping expenses were required.12  

Average yields in the SRV for the 2003–2010 period were 5.5 mt/ha in the saison hivernale versus 6.4 
mt/ha in the saison chaud. Up until the food crisis of 2007-2008, hivernale rice accounted for about 85 
percent of both production and surface area planted in the SRV. Even after farmers expanded 
production in the saison chaud following the food crisis, production in that season remained around 60 
percent as of 2010. Some farmers grew rice in both seasons, and usually not on the same land because 
they could not harvest and sell their crop, repay their loans, get approved for a new loan, and engage in 
land preparation in sufficient time. This was due to a combination of factors—delays in credit approval, 
bottlenecks in payments and processing due to cash flow constraints on processors, and shortages of 
machinery services for harvesting and land preparation. 

FIGURE 1: SENEGAL RIVER VALLEY AND DAKAR 

                                                      

11 Rice statistics were drawn from a variety of sources and combined to create consistent time series. These sources include 
Ntaal Mbay, the GOS Department of Projections and Statistical Analysis (DPSA), PNAR, and SAED. 
12 This is why the saison chaud is also called the contre-saison (loosely translated as the off-season) in the SRV.

The SRV begins in the delta region with the regional capital, Saint Louis, and has four sub-regions: 
Dagana, Podor, Matam, and Bakel. From Dagana to Matam is 216 miles or 260 miles by road. Dagana is 
in the delta and is the most heavily irrigated, fertile, and appropriate sub-region for growing rice. As one 
moves upstream from Dagana to Podor to Matam, the intensity of irrigation decreases, as does the 
density of value chain institutions such as large rice processing mills, machinery service providers, and 
access to urban markets. As shown in Table 2 below, Dagana accounts for two-thirds of area cultivated 
and production, with another 21 to 22 percent in Podor. Matam and especially Bakel historically 
contributed little to SRV rice production, mostly because of the lack of irrigation and value chain 
infrastructure, and the soil is less suitable for rice, and more suitable for onions, tomatoes, and other 
horticulture crops which are also more profitable. In sum, most rice is grown in the very small region 
between Rosso and Podor.

BOX 1: TYPES OF IRRIGATION IN THE SRV 

Not only is the SRV differentiated as one moves downstream, but there are also important differences in types of 

irrigation infrastructure. There are basically four categories of irrigation: 

1.  Grand aménagement (GA): Large, publicly constructed primary and secondary irrigation canals 

constructed, maintained, and managed by SAED, that irrigate prime land in large areas. Farmers who 
cultivate land in a GA are members of hydraulic unions set up by the GOS. 

2.  Aménagement intermédiaire (AI): Similar to GA but smaller in size and surface area. 
3.  Périmètre irrigué villageois (PIV): Small-scale, village-operated and maintained irrigation schemes that 
were also constructed by SAED but at a scale that allowed for traditional village cultivation practices. 
4.  Périmètre irriguée privée (PIP): Constructed and maintained by private individuals or private farmers’ 

associations, these vary widely in terms of size and quality depending on the means of the owners. 
However, the vast majority are more poorly constructed and maintained than the public sector schemes. 

There are some important differences between the four schemes in addition to size. The PIVs and PIPs are usually 
of lower quality, lack tertiary canals and access roads, and often lack drainage. For these and other reasons, 
particularly the lack of drainage, they have a tendency to build up mineral salts from repeated irrigation, and the 
land becomes unusable. 

During the post-structural adjustment period, lack of maintenance from SAED and private actors led 
significant areas that have irrigation infrastructure to become unusable. Of the remaining usable land, an 
additional portion was not cultivated, often for lack of financial resources to access inputs. Thus at the

beginning of scaling efforts, there were somewhere between 80,000 and120,000 ha aménagée (with 
infrastructure), out of which 50,000 to 60,000 ha were cultivatable. Between 2000 and 2007, irrigated 
rice actually planted fluctuated between 23,000 to 33,500 ha.  

B. Post Structural Adjustment and the Decline of the Irrigated Rice 

Value Chain 

The reasons for the stagnation in yields and decline in area cultivated are three-fold: (1) the steady 
regression of irrigation infrastructure; (2) the elimination of several state-sponsored support institutions; 
and (3) the failure of private value chain actors to adequately fill the gap left as the state retreated. The 
disengagement of the state was a consequence of structural adjustment agreements between the GOS 
and the IMF and World Bank in the first half of the 1990s. Prior to this policy change, the state provided 
for marketing, distribution, processing, and financial support. In addition,  

… [t]he state’s price stabilization fund operated an import monopoly; it organized the 
marketing and fixed the prices of both imported and local rice. The price of broken rice 
was fixed at around 50 percent of the price of whole rice. Within this system, a substantial 
levy was imposed on imported rice; in 1994/95, the year before the system was abolished, 
the difference between the cif world market price and the wholesale price in Senegal 
amounted to 28-31 FCFA/kg (compared with 8-19 FCFA/kg under the liberalized conditions 
introduced after 1996). Some of the revenue from the import monopoly was used to 
promote local production; however, a substantial proportion went towards funding the 
general state budget and the Senegalese Progressive Union party [emphasis added]. 

The currency was devalued by 100 percent, imports were liberalized and privatized, and 
the role of the rural development associations was reduced to a handful of core tasks such 
as the granting of loans, agricultural extension and providing support to private producers 
and processing companies. The transfer of responsibility for rice imports from the state to 
the private sector proceeded smoothly, despite fears to the contrary, although over time a 
significant concentration process has occurred. With the liberalization of imports, the 
state’s levies and quota system were abolished and the basic tariff now stood at around 15 
percent. Rice imports increased dramatically as a result. [Emphasis added].13 

In the SRV, this meant the privatization of the large rice mills and of agricultural machinery services that 
had been owned and operated by SAED. Similarly, SAED’s ability to provide infrastructure maintenance, 
technical assistance, and agricultural extension services was dramatically curtailed both as a matter of 
policy and because of reductions in their financial and operational capacity (e.g., fewer human resources 
and agricultural machines). Access to mechanical services became increasingly confined to those farmers 
working land on GAs and AIs, with limited access by PIPs and almost none by PIVs. 

While the transfer of rice importing to the private sector went smoothly, this was not the case for 
other parts of the rice market system. By and large this support and these services were not replaced by 
the private sector as it too declined. Large rice mills declined in number, operating capacity, and the 
quality of the rice they produced as their cleaning and sorting capabilities decreased. The privatized rice 
mills suffered from severe cash flow constraints, for investment and especially for operating funds to buy 
rice, process it, and sell it. Many shut down or limped between 1995 and 2010. As a result, downstream 
linkages to urban markets were disrupted. Farmers increasingly turned to small, local millers called 
décortiqueses (literally dehullers) to process their rice for their own consumption and local sales.

According to studies done by and interviews with PCE and JICA, the décortiqueses produced much 
lower quality rice even compared to the degraded large rice mills, as they did not have the facilities to 
clean, sort, or polish rice. At the time of the food crisis in 2007–2009, there were only 15 large 
processors active in Dagana compared with 112 décortiqueses; no large processors were active in 
Podor, Matam, or Bakel. All processing was done in those areas by 143 décortiqueses. 

Rice in the SRV became known for having uneven quality and color and a significant presence of stones 
and other impurities. Farmers reverted to selling their extra rice on local markets or to local 
intermediaries (banabana) who transported rice to neighboring areas of Senegal as well as across the 
Mali and Mauritania borders. While farmers continued to sell surplus rice and did not revert to being 
subsistence or safety-first farmers, there was effectively a degree of decommercialization of the SRV rice 
sector.  

The effects of the decline of millers and market access created a vicious circle in terms of credit and 
production. The state-owned agricultural bank, Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole du Sénégal 
(CNCAS), was also partly privatized as part of structural adjustment. Even though the state and civil 
society stakeholders retain a majority ownership, CNCAS was put on a more commercial footing. As a 
result of this tighter policy, farmers and millers who were in arrears or default were unable to access 
credit, limiting their ability to buy inputs for the next rice season or operate their mills. In years of poor 
production, millers and farmers were unable to repay their CNCAS loans, so that in the following 
seasons, CNCAS lending to farmers was largely confined to farmers’ organizations associated with GAs, 
but not PIVs or PIPs. While the GOS periodically provided resources to CNCAS to forgive bad debt 
(usually after presidential elections), the resumption of credit lasted only until the next poor harvest. As 
a result, a very small proportion of rice farmers had access to credit during this period, around one-
third of the total.14 CNCAS did not during this period offer either commercialization or equipment 
credit, further constraining the ability of the private sector to offer these services. Without access to 
credit, indebted farmers and millers were not able to earn enough to repay bank loans, falling further 
behind. 

The problems with processing, access to credit, and downstream market linkages were compounded by 
governance issues. The governance structures and resources of the hydraulic unions in the GAs and AIs 
were (and remain) much stronger than those of PIVs and PIPs. GAs and AIs received significant technical 
support from SAED and other government agencies; a state-sponsored consulting firm even provided 
assistance with financial accounting and management, crop calendars, and planning. Nonetheless, a 
noteworthy characteristic of the SRV—which was to facilitate scaling up and may not be present in 
other contexts—is that farmer organizations are omnipresent. Almost all rice farmers are highly 
organized and members of some form of farmers’ association or economic interest group (GIE – 
groupement d'intérêt économique). 

C. The World Food Crisis of 2007–2009 and the Government of 

Senegal’s Policy Response 

Despite domestic production, Senegal has consistently been one of the largest rice importers in the 
world15. In Africa, it is second only to Nigeria, and it varies in international rankings between seventh 
and ninth, depending on the year. In recent years, Senegal has had to import over one million metric

According to their data, as of 2015 Senegal was ranked 9th in the world, after China, Nigeria, the Philippines, Iran, Indonesia, 
Saudia Arabia, the EU and Iraq.  It is noteworthy that the EU imported 1,500 tons of rice vs. Senegal’s 1,100, despite the 
differences in population.

tons to meet domestic demand, and Senegal’s imports have increased steadily over the last decade 
despite the efforts of the GOS to stimulate increased production since 2006.

As can be seen in Figures 2 and 3, the spike in world rice prices between 2006 and 2009 had a substantial impact on Senegal. 
Moving closely with world prices despite some government intervention, domestic rice prices doubled at their peak in 2008. 
This caused rice imports to plummet by around 30 percent before resuming their steady climb in 2010. Interestingly enough, 
Senegal rice prices tended to track Thai prices until Thailand prohibited exports during the crisis. Senegalese importers shifted 
towards Indian rice, especially as India had large supplies of broken rice that both suited Senegalese tastes and was significantly 
cheaper. Senegalese importers were also under pressure from the GOS to keep rice prices down, and so substituted the 
cheaper Indian rice.

The price spike spurred the GOS to action. This was because of both concerns about the domestic 
political backlash of higher prices and a lack of food security among politically all-important urban 
consumers. 

Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal  

 

11 

 

The rice crisis led to an increase in the prevalence of food insecurity in urban areas. City 
dwellers in countries with high rice consumption levels spend 20 to 25% of their income on 
rice. In such contexts, the spike in rice prices had serious implications for household food 
security16. 

The change in GOS policy also was driven by the impact on Senegal’s balance of trade. Despite the 
decline in import volumes, Senegal’s rice import bill jumped from CFAF 130 billion in 2005 to nearly 180 
billion in 2009 (from $220 million to $308 million at 2016 exchange rates). The GOS embraced a policy 
of pursuing self-sufficiency in rice, setting a target for domestic production of one million metric tons 
(mt) of milled rice by 2012 (later reset to 2017 when this quickly showed itself to be unachievable). The 
GOS expected 800,000 mt to come from irrigated rice (mostly the SRV) and the rest to be rainfed. As 
milled rice is about two-thirds the weight of paddy rice, this translated into production of around 1.5 
million mt of paddy rice nationally and 1.25 million mt of irrigated rice. Almost all of the irrigated rice 
would have to come from the SRV.

To achieve these targets, the GOS initiated the Stratégie Nationale de Développement de la Riziculture 
(SNDR – National Rice Development Strategy) in 2008. It created the Programme National 
d’Autosufficanse en Riz (PNAR or National Program for Rice Self-Sufficiency) to translate this strategy 
into action. This was complemented by emergency campaigns to deal with the crisis, specifically the 
Grande Offensive pour la Nourriture et l’Abondance (GOANA – Grand Offensive for Nutrition and 
Abundance) which expected to dramatically accelerate cereal production immediately. The budget for 
this big push was set at CFAF 355 billion or $600 million, though at the time of the announcement the 
GOS had funding of only CFAF 32.2 billion.17 For rice, this included CFAF 13 billion for tractors and 2.4 
billion for combines.

17 GOANA was widely criticized at the time, including by the Conseil National de Concertation et de Coopération des Ruraux 
(CNCR – the National Council for Rural Cooperation and Consultation), the national quasi-official farmers’ organization. The 
various criticisms included fact that the goals were way too ambitious, the cost per ton was way too high, there was no way the 
GOS would be able to obtain and distribute sufficient agricultural inputs in a timely way, and that this was simply opening the 
door to vast corruption by organizations without distribution networks. It was also seen as a ploy to give land to the politically 
favored. The word “gabegie” was widely used, meaning defective and dishonest financial management, or waste.

The PNAR had, in principle, authority and resources both to implement its own activities and to guide 
and coordinate the activities of other public actors working in the sector. Its broad areas of operations 
included:18 

1.  Development of the rice seed sector. 
2.  Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes in disuse, building of new schemes, and achieving an average 

cropping intensity of at least 1.5 rice crops per year in these schemes (i.e., increasing double 
cultivation). It targeted putting into production around 115,000 ha of irrigated rice. 

3.  Providing farmers with access to agricultural equipment for irrigation, harvest, and post-harvest 

4. 

activities (specifically irrigation pumps, tractors, and combines) and rice processing plants. 
Increased diffusion of integrated crop management options to reduce yield gaps in both irrigated 
and rainfed systems. 

5.  Better organization of marketing, and the creation of private professional agencies in charge of 

buying, processing, and selling milled rice. 

6.  Development of a coherent input subsidy policy. 
7. 

Improved access to agricultural credit. 

The specific activities of GOANA and PNAR included massive support for the cereals sector. The GOS 
targeted rehabilitating 35,000 ha in the SRV alone. It spurred CNCAS to increase credit, which went 
from CFAF 2.1 to 3.2 billion. Forty percent of this credit went to saison chaud in 2008–2009 compared 
to zero in 2007–2008. The GOS also increased subsidies on inputs, credit, and other costs to the 
farmers, and instituted two government buying programs. Subsidies covering the costs of fertilizer and 
plant treatments alone were valued at CFAF 4.8 billion, and irrigation rehabilitation and investment at 
CFAF 18.1 billion.19 Part of this was the strategic rice reserve, the so-called Commissariat for Food 
Security (CSA – Commissariat à la Sécurité Alimentaire). This was complemented by the requirement 
that government agencies, especially the military, purchase domestic rice. 

D. SRV Rice Production Prior to Scaling of Rice Innovation Package 

The result of these policies, at least according to Senegal’s official statistics, was a dramatic surge in 
cereals production nationally in 2008–2009. As can be seen in Table 3 above, paddy rice production in 
the SRV increased by 257 percent over two years, from 144,601 mt in 2006–2007 to 244,352 mt in 
2007–2008 to 371,170 mt in 2008–2009. Among independent experts in research institutions, SAED 
staff, rice farmers and processors, and implementers of donor-funded projects, not one person 
interviewed believed that SRV (and national) rice production had increased anywhere to this extent. 
There was a general judgment that senior policymakers in the GOS pressured the relevant statistical 
agencies to inflate the numbers to look like the policy targets were being reached. In this view, the fact

that production declined in 2009–2010 to 281,000 tons is a more realistic appraisal of the facts on the 
ground.  

BOX 2: SCALING, NOT SELF-SUFFICIENCY 

It is important to note that this report is about the scaling up and sustainability of a package of innovations in the 
irrigated rice sector. While designed to increase yields, area planted and production, it was only expected to 
contribute to national self-sufficiency in rice, not achieve it. Scaling occurred in the context of a GOS strategy and 
programs to achieve self-sufficiency, and benefited from those programs and policy context. However, national 
rice self-sufficiency is impossible to achieve in Senegal, and in the rice consuming countries of West Africa writ 
large. Thus the success of scaling needs to be measured on its own terms. National self-sufficiency was and 
remains impossible because the required growth rate to catch up to demand is impossibly high given the large 
initial gap and the continued rapid growth of demand. Rice consumption in Senegal and West Africa has been 
growing at 5 to 6 percent annually, up 700 percent since 1961. Population growth alone has averaged nearly 3 
percent annually for decades and has been augmented by increased incomes and urbanization. While potentially 
the area cultivated in the SRV could double from levels planted in 2006, yields could increase by 50 percent, and 
yields in rainfed rice could double, this would not be sufficient. Thus, despite the supposed surge in production 
between 2006 and 2010, rice imports rebounded to over one million metric tons in 2010 and fluctuated between 
1.0 and 1.2 million mt for the ensuing years, or 1.5 to 1.8 million mt in paddy equivalent. Domestic paddy 
production of 250,000 to 429,000 mt remained around 25 to 30 percent of total consumption from 2010 to 2012, 
far from self-sufficiency. As noted by a joint publication of CIRAD, FAO, WFP and others: 

“Following the measures taken in 2008, the annual rate of increase of West Africa’s rice 
production has risen from 3.8% to 5.4%. However, the increase in consumption remains at 5 to 
6% per year, a rate that is too high for local production to make a lasting impact on self-
sufficiency in the region. Thanks to support measures and to an increase in local production, 
imports slowed in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, imports began to increase again as international rice 
prices fell [and incentives to local rice farmers to produce declined]. The increase in production 
has not, as of yet, led to a lasting reduction in the region’s dependence on international imports.” 

The good news for scaling up was that, assuming that domestic rice was competitive on price and quality, 
there was ample market demand for the increased production resulting from scaling up given the huge 
potential for import substitution. Because of this, there was no concern about flooding the market or 
lowering the prices.

One of the other key takeaways from the effort to increase production was that many SRV rice farmers 
faced binding constraints on the land they could cultivate during the hivernale season and so increased 
the area cultivated during the saison chaud as an alternative. This led the total cultivated area, as 
reported in the official statistics, to increase from 27,792 ha in 2006–2007 to between 50,000 and 
60,000 ha in 2008–2010. Of the increase of approximately 30,000 ha over that period, around two-
thirds were in saison chaud. The increase in area cultivated during the saison chaud allowed farmers and 
institutions like SAED to recognize more broadly what had long been true, namely that yields in the 
saison chaud were much greater than in hivernale, 1.25 to 1.65 mt/ha higher on average. Despite the 
higher costs of production, especially energy to run irrigation pumps, rice production in saison chaud 
turned out to be more productive and profitable. By 2009–2010 the share of saison chaud in total 
production had risen from 15 percent to between 35 and 45 percent, depending on the year. This was 
the state of play at the beginning of the scaling efforts led by PCE that started in 2010.

III.  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INNOVATION  

A critical component to studying scaling up is having a clear understanding of the innovation (or 
technology) under consideration. This includes examining how the technology is embodied in a product 
or service, as well as whether it is bundled with complementary products and services that are either 
necessary for successful implementation or have positive synergies with the innovation. This section 
discusses the rice innovation package that was scaled up in the Senegal River Valley.  

For this particular case study, the identification of the technology package was challenging because what 
was scaled up was a package of innovations, from Sahel rice varieties to GAPs to value chain innovations. 
Improved Sahel rice varieties were introduced in the 1990s and were widely adopted quickly in the SRV 
(Figure 4).

In other words, extensive scaling of Sahel rice varieties was already achieved well before 2010 on 
existing areas of rice cultivation. While PCE did introduce, with its partners such as AfricaRice, a 
number of new varieties, uptake has been at best uneven and the majority of farmers continue to grow 
the same three to four Sahel varieties introduced in the 1990s. However, the introduction of Sahel rice 
varieties did not translate into anywhere near the potential increase in yields that these varieties can 
produce (intensive scaling), nor in an expansion of land under rice cultivation in the SRV. The 
innovations that were introduced by PCE and its partners to support scaling and to achieve these results 
were: 

1.  GAPs, what came to be known as Le Chemin du Bon Riz (CBR – Pathway to Good Rice), with a 

special focus on the importance of adhering to the crop calendar (i.e. timeliness) and using 
certified seed. 

2.  Double cropping during both saison chaud and hivernale. 
3.  Financial products: 

  Crop insurance to cover the value of bank loans taken for inputs. 
  Commercialization/contractualization, a mix of a warehouse receipts system, negotiated 

prices, which facilitated cashless exchanges and economized on cash flow. 

  Machinery leasing. 
  Credit to millers and processors to provide cash flow in between purchases of paddy and 

sales of processed rice. 

4.  Strengthening of the rice value chain:  

  Quality seed production.

  Quality seed processing and certification facilities.  
  Supply, quality and increased use of mechanical services for land preparation and harvesting. 
  Rice processing capacity and quality. 
  Downstream linkages to formal wholesalers and urban markets. 

What is important to note about this list is that it was part of a scaling strategy with two key elements: 
(1) identifying immediate barriers to or constraints on scaling up, such as lack of ‘space’ for scaling in the 
Hartman and Linn framework sense, and (2) simultaneously supporting increased production (supply) 
and demand for rice. This section discusses the promotion of GAP and double cropping. The other 
innovations will be discussed in Section VI under scaling strategies. 

A. Good Agricultural Practices 

As part of its efforts to improve the quality and quantity of irrigated rice produced in the SRV, PCE 
introduced two sets of GAPs. The first was the Chemin du Bon Riz (CBR – Pathway to Good Rice) and 
the second was the Controle Qualité Riz (CQR – Rice Quality Control). PCE helped support rice 
quality control by teaching farmers how to monitor the quality of the rice as it developed. It trained 
farmers when to harvest for maximum quality and yield, both by visual inspection and by providing 
farmer organizations with mini-hullers that could be used to achieve maximum yield (minimum of 63 
percent polished rice from paddy, 71.7 percent for quality). The CBR contained 12 steps, listed in Table 
5 below.

Based on interviews with PCE staff and farmers, the most important innovations in terms of their impact 
on productivity were using certified Sahel rice seed and respecting the crop calendar. Planting on time 
had a significant impact on yields, and the same was true for harvesting at the optimal time for quality

and quantity. As many farmers had effectively been using grain as seed for years, use of certified seed 
made a significant difference in yield potential. However, as discussed below, at the start of PCE there 
existed significant constraints to actual implementation of these practices. Planting on time was often 
affected by delays in approval of farmers’ bank credit or the lack of bank credit. Planting and harvesting 
were both constrained by timely access to machinery services. 

Other changes in behavior as CBR was scaled up are illustrated by the testimony of the head of a 
farmers’ association working 300 ha on a PIV: 

After the PCE training, they started levelling the land, turning over the soil, lowered the 
amount of seeds from 160 to 80-120 kg/ha, did drainage of the land at the right time, and 
now harvest at the target maturity. 

An interview with a group of GIEs yielded the following insights: 

  They were able to change from a PIV to a GA thanks to SAED’s obtaining donor financing and 

constructing better, state-managed irrigation infrastructure in 2000.  

  Up until they became a GA, only a fraction of their members were able to access bank credit. 

After 2000 they all had access to CNCAS credit. 

  They produced only in hivernale until 2012. After that they started producing in saison chaud 

because the SAED pushed them to adopt double cropping. 

  They have difficulties in respecting the crop calendar that they learned from PCE: they get their 

input coupons late; they often start late because they have rain in the hot season, which 
interferes with the harvest from the previous season; there have been delays in getting 
combines onto their land. 

  They started the CBR training with PCE in 2013–2014.  
  They used the seed varieties 108, 201, and 202 until 2011. After 2011 they began to try other 

seed varieties, such as 134, 177, 328, 329, and AfricaRice varieties. These were excellent 
varieties, but they were too tall, and they were easily affected by wind. 

Several characteristics of the components facilitated scaling up of the CBR. First, most farmers were 
familiar with these GAPs, even if the extent to which they actually implemented them varied. The SAED 
provided most agricultural extension services in the SRV. The GAPs that PCE was promoting were 
drawn from a manual that SAED and AfricaRice had jointly developed20 and that SAED had supported 
and used since the 1990s. (The exception to this was the use of mini-hullers to test rice maturity, which 
was new.) An additional characteristic which facilitated adoption was that farmers could try the GAPs in 
small amounts (i.e., on only part of their land). 

The major challenges to adoption of the CBR by farmers were complexity, cost, and access to credit. 
According to group interviews with farmers and PCE staff, it often would take two to three seasons for 
a farmer to master all of the CBR. PCE, its implementing partners, and partner farm organizations 
devoted substantial time and human resources to providing extension services and technical assistance.  

Perhaps the other major innovation in rice production was the promotion of double cropping. 
According to various interviews, farmers favored growing only during the rainy (hivernale) season up 
until the food crisis. This was because it was cheaper, as less irrigation was necessary, and also it was 
encouraged by SAED. According to CNCAS, another reason was the deterioration of the formal rice 
processing sector. As the millers started to go out of business, the farmers had to do milling and selling

for themselves. This was quite time consuming and prevented farmers from having either the time or 
the cash flow to grow a second crop. 

B. The Business Case 

The various interventions detailed above had both costs and benefits to paddy producers. On the cost 
side, the shift to saison chaud production increased irrigation costs significantly, as more water is 
pumped than in the hivernage. Similarly, many farmers increased fertilizer and pesticide usage to the 
recommended levels as bank financing became more widely available. Higher production also implied 
higher harvesting, sacking, and transport costs; for example, mechanical harvesters charge 20 percent of 
the crop. On the benefits side, quality improvements resulted in higher prices negotiated with millers; 
prices have steadily increased from around CFAF 100 per kg to 120, 125, and now 130 since 2010. 

There are multiple sources for crop budgets for irrigated rice in the SRV. The ones examined in this 
report are from SAED, Centres de Gestion et d’Economie Rurale (CGER), and a recent study for 
USAID by the International Development Group (IDG). A comparison between the three sources 
showed that their results were within 10 percent of each other, with the exception of the IDG analysis 
which did not take into account the cost of bank charges, interest, and insurance. This report uses the 
IDG figures, presented in Table 6A below, as the basis for the business case analysis.

Total costs per hectare are around CFAF 550,000 to 600,000 (approximately $1000); however, this 
depends on yields, since some costs are variable, such as sacking, land rental (which is a cost for many 
farmers), and family labor. This is consistent with the anecdotal information provided in farmer group 
interviews where participants cited between CFAF 525,000 and 550,000.21 For example, the farmers in 
one union hydraulique stated that: 

… they borrow around CFAF 270,000 per farmer, that doesn’t include harvest, transport, 
reaping or irrigation. These cost at least CFAF 125,000 additional plus irrigation costs. They 
harvest around 125-130 sacks per hectare. They pay 20% of their harvest to the combine 
owner and have to reimburse 25-30 sacks to the bank, that leaves around 50-55 sacks for 
you. If they have surplus rice, they sell mostly to the banabana [local trader].22  

Paddy prices historically were around CFAF 100 but over the last several years have ranged from CFAF 
120 to 130 per kilogram23 with improvements in quality.24 Average production levels went from 5.4 
mt/ha in 2000–2006 to 5.75 in 2007–2010 to over 6 mt/ha since PCE started working. At paddy prices 
of CFAF 100/kg, breakeven production levels using modern technology would be between 5.05 and 5.33 
mt/ha depending on whether or not land rental and family labor costs are included, and around 2.7 
mt/ha if less capital-intensive technology was used. Using the lower figure of 5.05 and assuming the 
production yields of individual farmers are normally distributed, at a mean of 5.4 mt/ha, about two-thirds 
of farmers in any given year were making money. This means that one-third of farmers would be unable 
to repay their bank loans if they borrowed from the bank, and explains why there were persistent 
problems of bank arrears for rice farmers through the 2000s. 

As average yields rose to 5.75 mt/ha, not only did farming become more profitable, but the probability 
of negative returns fell to 25 percent and at 6.0 mt/ha to only 13 percent. At current prices, breakeven 
production levels fall to between 4.4 and 4.75 mt/ha, and profitability for farmers now exceeds 20–30 
percent on yields above 6 mt/ha. At the same time, risks have decreased. At an average yield of 6 mt/ha, 
less than 6 percent of farmers are likely to be unprofitable. However it is important to note that this 6 
mt/ha average combines very high yields of 6–8 mt/ha during the saison chaude with continuing low 
yields in the hivernage of around 5–5.5 mt/ha, depending on adverse weather, disease, and pests. At 
these lower yields, 15–20 percent or more of farmers may be unable to repay their loans, levels which 
are consistent with farmer interviews, where many farmers complained of being unable to repay because 
of recent adverse events in the hivernage season. As a result, many farmers are increasingly not planting 
during the hivernage. 

 

 

                                                      

21 The likely difference is that many farmers do not take into account, or defer, the costs of family labor, the rental costs of 
equipment and sprayers, and irrigation maintenance. Taken together these four items account for about CFAF 62,700. 
22 Group interview with members of a union hydraulique, Rossbechol, January 2016 
23 As discussed below, paddy prices are set through negotiations between the relevant social partners: farmers, processors, and 
other interested parties, with the Ministry of Agriculture.  
24 According to the IDG report, the increase from CFAF 100/kg was due to an increase in milled rice yields from 57 percent to 
63 percent of paddy.

The business case is equally important for the rest of the value chain, certified seed producers, millers, 
and financial intermediaries. The two relevant financial intermediaries, CNCAS and CNAAS, are both 
majority state-owned and their agricultural loans and insurance are subsidized by the GOS. Interviews 
with management from both organizations indicates that they evaluate potential loans/customers and set 
prices to be profitable. However, the large number of non-performing loans, need for regular debt 
forgiveness and capital infusions suggests that de facto at least CNCAS is loss making. Yet GOS 
interviewees said that these capital infusions, and subsidies for that matter, are fiscally sustainable 
(though there are no plans in the future for additional debt forgiveness). 

Certified seed production is profitable and was profitable prior to scaling up. The IDG report found that 
producers of certified seed were already profitable prior to the PCE intervention, and thanks to 
improved yields, this increase further:  

Improved yields mean farmers now obtain 5.1 MT of certified seeds per hectare compared 
to just 3.75 MT per hectare prior to the PCE project, while efficiency gains have raised

seed producers’ profitability from 532.8 thousand CFA/ha (US$ 926.6/ha) to 718.5 
thousand CFA/ha (US$1,249.6/ha).25 

The one area where profitability is uncertain is in rice milling. As noted above, millers suffered severely 
after privatization, with their capacity, quality, and profitability all declining.  PCE, JICA, and the Spanish 
Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) all provided assistance to millers. This 
included: equipment and training to improve quality (cleaning, sorting); warehouse construction to lower 
transactions costs; and cash flow financing for the period between collection from farmers and sales to 
wholesalers (contractualization, which allowed for a cashless system with farmers roughly based on 
warehouse receipts). The eight largest mills have a total capacity of 40.5 metric tons per hour. If the 
mills operated 24 hours, 365 days per year, their capacity would be 355,000 mt per year, compared with 
the total SRV paddy production in 2015 of around 440,000 mt. Assuming a more realistic capacity 
utilization of 66 percent, this implies that mills can currently handle about 50 percent of current 
production. However, the majority of farmers/production—around 77 percent—still goes through the 
local processors, the décortiqueses, so that the large mills appear to be operating at around 50 percent 
of capacity. Because of this, many millers complain about shortages of supply and low capacity utilization 
rates, though others state that they are well-supplied. According to a study done by CGER and 
commissioned by PCE, capacity and quality of large and medium-sized rice millers will have increased to 
the point where there will be sufficient capacity to handle all the rice being produced in the SRV by 
2017.

Because of the wide variance in capacity and utilization rates, and the fact that income statements are 
proprietary, it was not possible to provide a quantitative analysis of miller profitability. In the five 
interviews with millers, three complained of supply shortages and also constraints on their margins. 
Specifically, they mentioned that during negotiations around paddy prices they face pressure from the 
Ministry of Agriculture to pay higher prices to farmers, while at the same time they are squeezed on the 
other side by wholesalers, who in turn face price pressures from the Ministry of Commerce to keep 
retail prices low. At the same time, because of recent requirements that importers must make domestic 
purchases in proportion to their imports, many millers complain that they cannot get enough paddy rice 
to meet demand.

Unfortnatly, financial information for machinery service providers was not accessible. In one interview, a 
service provider who had purchased both a tractor and combine with credit from Locafrique in 2014 
explained that he was able to repay 50 percent of the loan within six months. Because of the high 
profitability, he purchased another three tractors and three combines with Locafrique credit in June/July 
2015. He has net annual earnings for a tractor of CFAF 28 million ($56,000) versus a purchase price of 
CFAF 37.5 million, not including interest expenses ($75,000). The comparable figures from this provider 
were gross sales for a harvester of CFAF 28 million ($56,000) and net profits of CFAF 19.75 million 
($39,500), versus a purchase price of CFAF 18 million ($136,000). Given that both combines and 
tractors nearly pay for themselves in a year, they appear to be highly profitable. This service provider 
noted that tractors are not only used for rice but also for land preparation for higher value added crops 
such as onions and tomatoes. 

IV.  ADOPTION DRIVERS AND RESULTS OVER TIME AND 
SPACE 

A. Market Potential 

In many cases of scaling up, the potential for demand to absorb increased supply without adverse price 
effects is a major challenge. This is not the case in Senegal. As noted in Section II, Senegal has been a 
major rice importer for decades, and despite government efforts at self-sufficiency since the 2007–2009 
food crisis, rice imports have continued to increase (see Figure 2). As rice imports have exceeded one 
million tons since 2012, more than double the current production levels in the SRV, from a purely 
quantitative perspective, there is no shortage of demand.

BOX 3: RICE IMPORTS AND PRICING IN SENEGAL 

Before liberalization under structural adjustment, rice imports were a monopoly under the Caisse de Péréquation 
et du Stabilization des Prix (the Office or Fund for Price Equalization and Stabilization), which set prices for both 
local and imported rice. While the import monopoly was eliminated in 1995, it was replaced with price controls 
which persisted until 2006. A short period of liberalization was followed by a return to price controls on imported 
ordinary broken rice in 2008, which were then extended to aromatic rice in 2011 and finally the reintroduction of 
officially fixed prices in 2013. Prices for non-aromatic broken imported rice were set at CFAF 240/kg for importers, 
CFAF 245/kg for wholesalers, and CFAF 260/kg for retailers. This price freeze led to annual budget allocations of 
CFAF 25 billion for rice price supports, or roughly $50 million. It also incentivized importers to search out lower 
and lower price (quality) rice in an attempt to sustain and increase margins, following on the switch from aromatic 
to ordinary rice. 

Over this same period, post food crisis, prices for paddy were set through price negotiations between millers and 
producers, with other social partners also participating. Under the guidance of the Comité Interprofessionnel du 
Riz (CIRIZ – Interprofessional Committee on Rice), prices were set at 125 CFAF/kg in 2013–2014 and 120 CFAF/kg 
in 2014–2015 in line with declining import prices. The GOS must respond to conflicting pressures to keep prices 
down for consumers and to increase prices for producers. 

A 2015 study by Dr. Ibrahima Hathie and Oumar Samba  Ndiaye, on behalf of the European Commission, found 
that, despite  price  controls,  there  is  significant  but  imperfect  transmission  of  international into  domestic  prices. 
Transmission occurs because imports set the price  at the margin. At the same time, domestic rice markets  are 
relatively  segmented  between  urban  and  rural,  household  and  commercial, and  even  the  prices  for  rice  used  at 
different  meals.  This  is  illustrated  by  the  very  different  downstream  market  paths  of  rice  that  is  milled  by 
décortiqueses  versus  industrial  mills.  Surplus  rice  processed  by  décortiqueses  is  largely  sold  through  informal 
channels by small traders, as opposed to formal market channels for industrially processed rice. 

 

This raises the question of whether SRV irrigated rice is competitive at world prices. This question is 
reinforced by significant government interventions at all stages of the rice value chain and imports. 
Currently the domestic rice sector benefits from a large number of significant government subsidies, 
including on inputs, bank credit, crop insurance, and purchases of agricultural machinery, as well as 
requirements on importers that they buy domestic rice. Studies of competitiveness are complicated by 
the questions of quality and what is the comparable international product.26 Choosing the comparable 
import is also complicated by the setting of imported and domestic prices (see Box 3). 

Despite the challenges of quality, there have been a number of studies over the last several years with 
general conclusions that SRV rice has been competitive since world prices rose during the food crisis 
and then remained at historically high levels. Interviews with CNCAS, the national agricultural bank, 
state that domestic rice was not competitive during the period between the mid-1990s and 2007. In one 
study, GIG Consultants (a Paris-based firm),27 concluded that efforts to improve domestic quality were 
proving successful and that domestic rice would progressively conquer the national market (“conquérir 

                                                      

26 Prior to the food crisis, most imported rice was aromatic, but with the price jump, consumers—and therefore importers—
switched to ordinary rice. Senegalese consumers have preferred broken rice, initially because it was cheaper, but now the 
mouthfeel and texture have become preferences for rural consumers. In the last few years there has been a growing demand by 
higher-income urban consumers for whole rice and aromatic rice, and many urban consumers prefer whole rice. In general, 
domestic rice has to compete with imported broken rice. However, internationally marketed broken rice is of a certain quality 
in terms of uniformity of color, shape, size of the grain, and especially the presence of foreign materials such as dirt, stones, and 
rice straw. PCE and other donors have therefore undertaken efforts to improve quality as part of scaling up. According to 
Hathie and Ndaiye, 95 percent of imported rice is broken rice. See Dr. Ibrahima Hathie and Oumar Samba Ndiaye, “Etat des 
lieux des impacts des importations de riz sur la commercialization du riz local”, RAPPORT FINAL, Iniative Prospective Agricole 
et Rurale (IPAR), Janvier 2015. p. 14.

progressivement le marché national”). The GIG study found that production costs were around CFAF 
100/mt with gross margins between 26 and 32 percent. They found that rice remained profitable even 
without input subsidies, but gross margins fell to 15 percent (as inputs account for only 18 percent of 
costs, slightly less than the share of either labor or irrigation costs). They concluded that domestic rice 
has been profitable because international rice prices remained at historically high levels, even after they 
came down from their 2008–2009 peak, as shown in Figure 5.28 However, they argued that there was a 
narrow band of rice prices that made it sufficiently profitable to incentivize sustained and increased 
production, and to ensure this, there needed to be continued government subsidies, in the form of 
either tariffs or input subsidies.

some countries banned exports in the immediate aftermath of the world food crisis, i.e., from 2008 to 2011. 

These general conclusions were confirmed by other studies. A 2015 study by Dr. Ibrahima Hathie and 
and Oumar Samba Ndiaye, on behalf of the European Commission,29 also found that production was 
quite profitable, but very price sensitive, and the same was true for other members of the value chain. 

La marge des producteurs est intéressante mais elle est très sensible au prix pratiqué. Se le 
prix paddy pratiqué s’écarte beaucoup du prix official, la rentabilité du producteur s’en 
resent fortement. Cette situation est rendue plus fragile par les volumes relativement 
faibles sur lesquels opèrent la majorité de ces producteurs ….  

                                                      

28 The French agency, Observatoire de Statistiques Internationales sur le Riz (OSIRIZ) publishes an index of rice prices. The 
rice price index was around 100 in 2003, and then jumped from 144 in 2007 to 294 in 2008. Since 2009 the OSIRIZ index has 
hovered in a range between 210 and 255.

La marges des autres acteurs ne sont pas non plus assez elevées. Ce qui explique sans 
doute les fortes pressions que ces acteurs de l’aval exercent sur les producteurs afin de 
revoir à la baisse le prix official du paddy. (Hathie and Ndiaye, p. 7) 

Translation: Producer margins are attractive but very sensitive to actual paddy prices. If the 
actual paddy price deviates much from the official prices, the profitability for producers 
would be seriously affected. This situation is even more the case for the majority of 
producers, i.e., those who cultivate relatively small parcels. 

The margins for other value chain actors are also not much higher. This explains the strong 
pressures that downstream actors have put on producers to lower official prices. 

Later, in discussing the relationship between imported and domestic prices, Hathie and Ndiaye reinforce 
the negative impact on rice value chain actors of the price squeeze. They note that the massive 
importation of low-quality Indian broken ordinary rice has strongly affected the margins for millers and 
distributors, menacing their profitability.30 The finding that downstream actors face serious pressures on 
margins was confirmed in the review team’s interviews and by other sources as well.31 

V.  THE EXTERNAL CONTEXT OR SPACES 

Context is usually very important to the success and strategy in scaling up. That was equally true in the 
Sahel rice case. This section looks at spaces of the rice value chain, including credit and insurance, 
mechanization, politics and policy, and institutions and partnerships. 

A. Rice Value Chain 

Most of the necessary institutions for a viable commercial rice value chain in the SRV already existed 
before 2010, but many were weak or barely functioning. There was an inadequate supply of certified rice 
seed, quality rice milling capacity was very limited, and downstream linkages to formal markets were 
almost nonexistent. Each of these issues is discussed in more detail below.  

Certified Rice Seed Production 

As noted above, as of 2010 most rice farmers in the SRV were already using improved seeds that had 
been introduced in the 1990s. A few varieties accounted for nearly all rice planted: Sahel 108 (a short 
maturity variety of 105–115 days) and Sahel 201 and 202 (medium maturity varieties of around 120–140 
days) with potential yields of 10 and 11 mt/ha. By 2000 these three varieties accounted for over 70 
percent of rice planted in the SRV.32  

                                                      

30 Hathie and Ndiaye, op. cit., “Les importations massive”  
31 See, for example, CGERV (Management Center of Rural Economy of the Valley) in its publication Bulletin Economic Analysis 
for the Rice Sector. The June 2015 issue, Rice Self-Sufficiency in Senegal, stated “However, in the absence of some 
opportunities for white rice paddy or milled, distributors, processors and commercants are struggling to make their activities 
profitable.” P.14 
32 In 2005, the GOS approved and officially released five additional varieties for use by rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley. 
These were: Sahel 134, Sahel 159, Sahel 208, Sahel 209, and Sahel 210, with the 100 series being short maturity and the 200 
series medium/long maturity. These new varieties were supposedly superior, e.g., the new 200 series varieties had 12 mt/ha 
potential yields, but uptake was limited, and the majority of seed planted remained 108, 201, and 202. According to interviews 
with most farmers, they stuck with the old varieties for several reasons: they were not getting anywhere close to potential yield 
on the old varieties; those varieties did well under local conditions, especially in the longer rainy season (hivernale); they

The structure of certified seed production dates back to the late 1980s. The Institut Sénégalais de 
Recherches Agricoles (ISRA – Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research) controls rice foundation 
seed and production of breeder seed. Multiplication is done by an association of seed farmers, the Union 
Nationale Interprofessionnelle des Semences (UNIS – National Interprofessional Union of Seeds). 
However, as adoption of new rice seed varieties scaled up over the second half of the 1990s, production 
of certified rice seed did not keep pace. Most rice planted in the SRV is broadcast after soaking. 
Recommended seed usage is 130 kg/ha, so surface areas of roughly 25,000 ha during the 2000–2007 
period would have required approximately 3,500 mt of seed per year. By contrast, only 400 mt of 
certified rice seed was produced as recently as 2011.Thus by the time PCE started in 2010, the majority 
of farmers were not only planting saved seeds, but seeds that had become essentially grain. 

The seed sector suffered from numerous challenges detailed in a study conducted by PCE at the 
beginning of its activities.33 These challenges included: 

  Disorganization of upstream production of foundation seed. 
  Difficulties in planning for demand with little effective collaboration or communication between 

ISRA, the foundation seed producer, and UNIS-Nord, the union of seed multipliers. 

  Difficulties in controlling the costs of collection, processing, and transaction, making the seeds’ 

sale price unaffordable for many producers. 

  No effectively functioning seed testing and certification laboratories in the SRV. 
 

Inadequate and poorly functioning seed conditioning centers. 

As part of its scaling efforts, PCE began by creating “space” for certified rice seed by both increasing 
supply and increasing demand for certified seed. PCE supported: 

  Upgrading of two ISRA research stations (e.g., cold storage, electricity, facilities, and cost 

accounting system). 

  Construction/rehabilitation and modernization of the equipment at a regional seed lab in the city 

of Richard Toll, boosting seed processing capacity to 6,000 mt. 

  Financial coaching and governance support to UNIS. 
  Better linkages between ISRA and UNIS-NORD (i.e., three-year procurement plans and 

placement of foundation seed orders with ISRA). 

  Capacity building of UNIS-NORD.  
  Establishment of a network of seed inspectors to supplement existing government inspectors. 
  Public-private partnership between Coopérative Semencière du Nord (COOSEN), a seed 

cooperative organized by PCE, and the MOA to manage a seed conditioning center at Richard 
Toll. 
Introduction of additional new varieties combined with demonstration and marketing efforts. 

 
  Requirement for use of certified seed for farmers involved with contractualization. 

The results of these efforts have been a steady increase in the supply, availability, and adoption of 
certified rice seed and a better ability to match the three-year multiplication cycle with demand. Roughly 
2.2 mt of rice seed were produced by UNIS in the 2014 rainy (hivernale) season. As of 2010, and 
through the period under study, the majority of certified seed used continued to be the three dominant 

                                                      

themselves and consumers like the taste and mouthfeel; and they already owned them as these are all OPVs. See AfricaRice’s

varieties first introduced in 1995 -- Sahel 108, 201 and 202.34  It is estimated that certified seed now 
accounts for about 30 percent of total production in the SRV; this was achieved despite the more 
than100 percent increase in the surface area planted since 2006. Seed certification and processing 
capacity has now increased so that it can meet nearly 70 percent of potential demand, though 
production is nowhere close to that yet. There are some estimates that using certified Sahel seed may 
increase rice yields by as much as 25–30 percent, which may have contributed significantly to intensive 
scaling efforts and results.

In terms of the space for other inputs, the supply chain has been less problematic than the supply of 
certified seeds. There is a fairly dense network of agricultural input suppliers in SRV, though this 
becomes progressively thinner as one moves upstream from Dagana to Podor and Matam. Farmers with 
access to bank credit receive something resembling a voucher for the agreed upon inputs from the 
CNCAS and are able to retrieve the needed inputs from designated depots. The major issue with access 
to inputs has been the timeliness of availability. As much of the supply of fertilizer in particular is 
controlled by state entities, as it is subsidized, that supply is not always available in time for optimal 
planting or secondary top dressings. This also can be caused by delays in approval of bank credit, as 
farmers are required to submit their applications twice per year if they farm both seasons, but 
historically the bank has waited until the previous season’s loan has been repaid.  

Processing 

Rice milling was one of the major constraints on scaling up as of 2010. The steady deterioration of the 
ability of large mills to process sufficient quantities and quality of paddy rice after 1995 meant that SRV 
rice could not compete in quality with imported rice in urban markets. Thus, despite the huge potential 
for import substitution and selling in formal urban markets, de facto the market for surplus rice was 

                                                      

34 Sometimes there is a mismatch between the varieties produced and farmers’ preferences as the Senegalese authorities have 
encouraged the production of seed for the new varieties introduced since 2005 to facilitate their adoption, yet the majority of 
farmers still prefer the old Sahel varieties.

limited to either local village markets, or to those traders who would buy locally and sell in nearby 
regions.  

In response to these issues, PCE, JICA, and AECID worked together to rehabilitate the processing 
sector. JICA provided new milling equipment and training that expanded the quantity and quality of rice 
produced, allowing the large mills to do better cleaning and sorting. PCE subsidized loans to buy new 
machinery or expand capacity, covering 35 percent of the capital cost, and partnered with CNCAS to 
provide working capital to millers. 

As a result of these efforts, large milling capacity increased to 155,000 mt at the end of the 2013–2014 
season as compared with production of around 332,731 mt. Thus large mills could cover around half of 
the processing, although in reality they are covering somewhere between one-eighth and one-quarter as 
farmers continue to prefer working with the small décortiqueses. Faced with excess capacity, most 
larger mills both started to grow their own rice and also directly contracted with farmers, in some cases 
supplying inputs in advance. For example, one mill in Caoumba produces 1,000 ha of its own rice and 
finances a network of 13,000 farmers producing on 7,000 ha. Nonetheless, it appears that many farmers 
still find it more profitable or preferable to use local décortiqueses, possibly because transport and 
storage costs are lower or because they can process rice in small batches as they need income over the 
course of the year. 

Marketing and Downstream Linkages 

Marketing SRV rice to domestic markets in Senegal was and remains complicated by the fact that the 
market is highly segmented. Tastes and preferences differ between urban and rural consumers and even 
by meal. Historically, urban consumers, especially those with higher incomes, have favored whole, 
aromatic rice that has been well cleaned and sorted. Rural consumers are more price-sensitive, so that 
the choice of cheaper broken rice evolved into a taste preference over time. Similarly, rural consumers 
tend to be less sensitive to uniformity of color, shape, or the presence of foreign materials, and are 
willing to sort and clean rice themselves.  

The disintegration of the rice value chain since the 1990s meant that rice processors in the SRV had 
little contact with formal market outlets in urban areas. Urban consumers were completely unaware 
that domestically produced rice was available, let alone the quality improvements which had taken place 
after 2010 in processing as well as the introduction of aromatic rice. As of 2010, the vast majority of 
surplus SRV rice was sold by small traders to surrounding areas, mostly rural consumers. However, 
there were limits as to how much rice these channels could absorb, as well as the price that they were 
willing to pay.  

Once the quality of SRV rice had been improved to meet urban market standards, PCE helped with the 
downstream market linkages from millers to wholesalers. PCE helped millet producers improve their 
branding and packaging, organized several meetings between millers and wholesalers, and brought SRV 
rice to several agriculture fairs (e.g., the annual International Fair of Agriculture and Animal Resources). 
PCE sponsors the participation of both millers and producers in this fair. PCE created a promotional 
caravan of Senegal origin rice that took place in three major cities, including Dakar. Finally, PCE helped 
SRV mills in successfully bidding on World Food Program tenders for rice; the Coumba Nor Thiam mill 
won a tender for 3,000 mt of white rice.  

Demand for domestic rice has also been supported by a number of government policies. The GOS 
began purchasing domestic rice for a strategic reserve and required that government agencies (e.g., the 
military and schools) purchase domestic rice. Perhaps most importantly, as importers began shifting to 
cheaper imported Indian rice, the GOS required that importers purchase domestic rice in proportion to 

Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal  

29 

 

the level of their imports. This latter move has greatly increased the demand for SRV rice, so that many 
of the large mills and importers cannot get sufficient rice to meet demand. 

B. Credit and Insurance 

Intensive production of irrigated rice requires substantial financial resources to purchase the necessary 
inputs; for land preparation, harvesting, and threshing services; and to finance supplementary labor. As 
discussed in Section III-B, farmers spend CFAF 550,000+ per hectare to grow rice.  

Despite the disengagement of the state from providing direct services, up until recently the state 
remained the sole source of bank lending through the CNCAS. While not a state agency, the CNCAS is 
majority-owned by the GOS, and many of the remaining shares have been distributed to social partners 
such as farmers’ associations. Since the 1990s, CNCAS has been providing credit to less than half of rice 
farmers in the SRV. In large part this is because many small and medium producers regularly become 
(re)indebted when there is a bad harvest. This has meant that CNCAS regularly carried a large amount 
of non-performing agricultural loans, or loans in arrears. As CNCAS is not permitted to extend further 
credit to farmers in arrears, these farmers have had no access to credit and accordingly used lower 
quantities of seed and other inputs, and less mechanization. In most cases they obtained lower yields.  

 
Repeated rounds of debt forgiveness between 1995 and 2010 only proved to be temporary solutions to 
this problem, as the problem reemerged with the next poor harvest, and there was no crop insurance 
available during this period. Similarly, the fact that agricultural interest rates are subsidized by the GOS 
has not solved the availability and creditworthiness problems. Moreover, even for farmers able to access 
bank loans, the lending amount was limited to the value of tangible inputs and some key services, 
somewhere between CFAF 250,000 and 350,000. In cases where an adverse weather or pest event 

 

Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal  

30 

 

required farmers to reapply seeds, fertilizer, or herbicides, this additional cost was not covered by bank 
loans. This meant that farmers had to find the remaining funds themselves.  

Similar problems plagued processers (e.g., rice mills) and entrepreneurs interested in purchasing 
agricultural machinery (usually farmers themselves or their associations). Processors suffered from acute 
shortages of working capital to purchase and store paddy rice until it could be processed and sold to 
wholesalers, and payment from wholesalers was received. Bank financing for this was not available, nor 
was financing available for capital investment in equipment and expanding facilities. Mills had difficulty in 
paying farmers for their production in a timely way, so farmers faced delays in paying off their bank 
loans, delaying receipt of a loan for the next season, delaying land preparation and timely planting. This 
delay was particularly problematic for farmers interested in adopting double cropping (i.e., planting in 
both the saison chaud and the hivernale). Financing for purchases of agricultural machinery was very 
limited as it required collateral apart from the machine itself, due to the lack of a secondary market.  

Addressing this constraint, the lack of financial “space,” has probably been the most important of all the 
contributions PCE made to revive the irrigated rice sector. PCE, working with several partners, 
introduced several financial innovations that increased the availability of financing not only to farmers, 
but to mills and machinery service providers. PCE did this through a variety of instruments, providing 
cost sharing or co-financing of investment, to cover the costs. Several common themes emerged in 
terms of what worked, including: reducing risk to economic actors on both ends of financial 
transactions; making iterative progress, as solutions required repeated tweaking; and not covering the 
losses from partners’ poor business decisions (while PCE was willing to absorb some of the risk, they 
maintained a firm position on this). 

The most important financial innovation introduced by PCE was known by the French term 
‘contractualization’, a mix of contract farming and a warehouse receipts system. This was introduced 
beginning with the 2011–2012 season.  

In 2011, a pilot was launched in collaboration with Vital agro-industries [the largest rice 
processor and foreign investor in the SRV rice sector], CNCAS and water user associations 
to integrate financial models that would improve CNCAS reimbursement rates while laying 
the foundation for a formal and solvent rice market. Consolidated in 2012 through a series 
of meetings and workshops with key stakeholders, these models have enabled the sale of 
nearly 20,000 T and mobilized more than US $11 million.35 

Contractualization eventually emerged in two forms: (1) between banks and producers, and (2) in a 
three-way relationship between the bank, producer, and processor. In the first form, farmers were 
required to find their own purchaser, which often led to delays in sales and in farmers’ receiving 
payment. In the second form, banks provided credit to farmers who sold the contract on a forward sale 
to a processor, all of which was done at a price agreed in advance. Once transfer to the processor 
actually took place, the proceeds were used to repay the loan, with the loan now being between the 
bank and the processor. In this process, no cash was actually used; repayment was effectively in the form 
of paddy rice deposited in a warehouse. Bank credit was issued to farmers that allowed them to buy 
inputs through vouchers; farmers deposited their production in processors’ warehouses and received a 
warehouse receipt that was considered as payment once it was transferred to the bank. This 
economized on cash. 

For contractualization to work, PCE had to put in place, with its partners, several foundational pieces. 
These included:

  Establishing a fixed forward price. This price could be and ultimately was used by banks, 

 

producers, and processors as a reference price. Eventually, the price produced by the CIRIZ 
multi-stakeholder consultative process emerged as the reference price and has been used for 
the last several years. 
Improvements in yields and quality from both farmers and processors. Higher average yields 
increased the likelihood of repayment, and quality improvements made the rice more 
marketable and allowed SRV rice to be competitive with imported rice. CNCAS bank loans have 
now for several years required the use of certified seed.  

  Providing storage facilities for paddy and processed rice. Construction of a large number of 

warehouses was financed by the AECID. Unfortunately, construction is slow and expensive, and 
the existing volume of storage remains much less than need.  As of this writing, storage is a 
major constraint on further scaling. 

  The innovation of crop insurance. It may appear surprising that crop insurance is needed in the 
case of irrigated rice, but while drought was rarely a factor, there were several other important 
risks. These included excess rain or flooding in the hivernale season, and attacks by pests, either 
birds or insects. (See Box 4). 
 

BOX 4: CROP INSURANCE IN THE SRV 

In its initial version, the crop insurance that was developed with CNAAS was designed to protect the lending bank 
against losses rather than the farmer, as the insurance covered only the amount of the bank loan. It was also limited 
in  its  coverage  to  very  specific  types  of  water  and  pest  damage.  In  the  2015  hivernale  season,  many  farmers 
experienced severe damage from bird attacks, but they were the wrong kinds of birds, ordinary birds as opposed 
to the grain-eating birds (i.e., grainivores) that are specified in the insurance contract. These two characteristics of 
the  crop  insurance  caused  substantial controversy  in  the  winter  of  2016  when  claims  were  not  being  honored. 
However, changes are currently under consideration, including expanding coverage to the value of the crop rather 
than the financed inputs.  

In Figure 6, the subtitle in French says: “I insure my harvest, I secure my revenues.” However, the insurance sold 
did not insure the harvest, but only the value of the bank loan, which is half of the cost of production, or roughly 
one-third the value of the harvest. Given this promotional billboard, it is not surprising that farmers were upset by 
the limited coverage when they filed claims. As with bank interest rates, crop insurance premium are supposedly 
set  at  actuarially  fair  rates  and  the  subsidized  by  the  GOS;  the  actual  premium  is  CFAF  10,000,  while  the 
unsubsidized rate would be 20,000. Crop insurance benefitted 5,000 farmers by the end of 2013–2014.

FIGURE 6: PROMOTIONAL BILLBOARD FOR CROP INSURANCE IN THE SRV36 

(“I Insure My Harvest, I Secure My Income”) 

 

The result of these efforts was a substantial increase in bank lending by CNCAS and by other banks such 
as Banque National pour le Développement Economique (BNDE) and Partenariat pour la Mobilisation 
de l’Epargne et le Crédit Au Sénégal (PAMECAS) (see Table 10 below). According to PCE, total lending 
for irrigated rice using contractualization was $14.3 million in 2014, or around CFAF 7 billion.  

GOS policy and intervention played a major role in increasing access to credit. In particular, in 2014 the 
GOS injected CFAF 8 billion to wipe out the debts of farmers and millers. In 2014, the GOS also 
created a commercialization fund of CFAF 5 billion that was available to finance working capital for rice 
mills for the 2015 season. The combination of debt forgiveness and additional access to capital no doubt 
played an important role in the jump in lending in 2014–2015. However, as the head of one large 
farmers’ association testified in an interview, the concerns about debt repayment remained: “Right now 
in 2016 there are seven GIEs [in our association] who are again in debt and can’t fully repay their 
current loans; there were two to three who benefitted from the debt forgiveness in 2014.” This 
indebtedness has impeded not only farmers’ access to semi-annual financing for the rice seasons, but 
also their ability to buy additional agricultural equipment when needed (i.e., tractors).37

PCE supported increased purchases of agricultural machinery through a partnership with Locafrique, a 
leasing company. Lease financing by Locafrique was available for combines, tractors, graders, and factory 
equipment. This was a major innovation as Locafrique was willing to make loans with the machinery 
itself as collateral. In interviews, Locafrique management said that they found that because of substantial 
excess demand for machinery services, most loans were relatively risk-free; they were successfully able 
to make such loans based on business plans and the character of the borrower. Locafrique has steadily 
expanded the size of its business. According to PCE, by 2014 it was supporting CFAF 1.6 billion (or 
around $3.4 million) in leasing credit, with additional applications currently in process of CFAF 3 billion 
($6 million). According to Locafrique, they have been so successful in their activities that they have 
started to withdraw from lending in the Dagana area, as they believe the agricultural machinery leasing 
market there is saturated.  

C. Mechanization 

Machinery services for irrigated rice has been available in the SRV for many years, including the use of 
combine harvesters, tractors, and graders for land preparation. Prior to the disengagement of the state, 
SAED provided most of these services. Since the mid-1990s, the private sector has provided them, but 
not necessarily on a timely or affordable basis due to shortages of machinery, financing to purchase 
machinery, and access to credit so that farmers could pay for machinery services. While there are no 
statistical data available on the share of farmers using machinery services, by 2010 the share of farmers 
appears to have been relatively low. For those farmers who could had sufficient funds or access to 
credit, delays in timing adversely affected productivity. Many farmers planted late while waiting for land 
preparation, and similarly harvesting was not done at the optimal time. In an interview, a tractor service 
provider noted that he went into the business to supply his own needs because of the long delays: “The 
biggest problem for years has been getting services on time, they often have to wait just until they were 
pushed to the limit of when you can plant. The same thing happens in the harvest.”38

The GOS has been active since the food crisis in increasing the supply of agricultural machinery in the 
SRV. The GOS has provided subsidized loans for machinery (subsidies of 60–70 percent of market 
price). However, according to interviews with farmers and machinery service operators, this program 
has been at best a mixed success. The quality of the machines provided was low, and many farmers 
reported mechanical problems after the first year, complicated by the fact that most GOS-subsidized 
machines came with no service guarantee. In general, repair and servicing have been very limited in the 
SRV, especially east of Dagana. 

The GOS program, combined with the efforts of Locafrique, led to an enormous expansion of the 
availability of machinery services in the SRV and has largely eliminated delays and shortages. According 
to a group interview with farmers from a union hydraulique:  

There are now [January 2016] more than enough tractors in the region for getting the 
services that they need. It is only since 2014 that there have been enough tractors, many 
of which came from the state-subsidy program. [They own three themselves, and rent the 
services of nine more].  

Until this season there haven’t been enough combines to do the double culture because of 
the delays in harvesting that causes. They are hoping to do both in this season. They 
themselves only have one combine.  

D. Politics and Policy 

As noted above, the Senegal’s public policy and programming have been tremendously supportive of 
scaling up of irrigated rice production in the SRV given the government’s commitment to achieving rice 
self-sufficiency (Figure 7). This alignment at the highest levels of government policy facilitated several 
critical partnerships for PCE and other donor efforts, such as with SAED, CNCAS, and CNAAS.

SUFFICIENCY” 

In addition to this general support and cooperation, the GOS has provided substantial programmatic 
support to improving productivity and increasing scale of irrigated rice production in the SRV. First and 
foremost were subsidies from one end to the other of irrigated rice production. These subsidies 
included:  

  Subsidized loans: conservative estimate of 12 percent of the loan value, 7.5 percent interest 

 

from CNCAS. 

  Subsidized insurance: 50 percent of CFAF 20,000. 
  Subsidized equipment: 60 to 70 percent of the cost. 
  Subsidized fertilizers: 50 percent on urea and DAP. 
  Value-added tax (VAT) exemption on local rice. 
 

Income tax exemption for millers. 

In addition to these direct subsidies, the GOS also provided various guarantee funds and indemnification 
for losses to CNCAS and others. It is important to note that, according to interviews with the head of 
PNAR and other GOS officials involved in the rice sector, the size of these subsidies is small enough 
relative to the overall GOS budget to be sustainable at least until self-sufficiency is reached, which is 
likely to be a long time. 

The second major area of support for irrigated rice has been through various efforts to influence and 
support prices received by producers. The CIRIZ mechanism of consultation by the relevant social 
partners is facilitated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment, and in general has tended to 
support higher prices for producers. This has been reinforced by, at various times, export bans, fixed 
prices for paddy and imported rice, GOS purchases for a strategic rice reserve and by GOS agencies for 
their own consumption, and, most recently, the requirement that rice importers purchase a certain 
amount of local rice. 

Finally, GOS support allowed donors, such as JICA and AECID, to come into the sector and support it. 
In addition to the specific efforts by PCE, JICA, and others, many donors have also been persuaded to 
invest millions of dollars in rehabilitating or expanding irrigation infrastructure.

E.  Institutions and Partnerships 

PCE formed strategic partnerships and undertook capacity building with a number of institutions to 
strengthen the value chain and policy environment. Particularly important were its partnerships with 
financial institutions, Africarice and ISRA, and with SAED. Africarice and ISRA are and remain the 
suppliers of breeder and foundation seed that allowed for the increased supply of certified Sahel seed. 
SAED played a critical role in supporting technical assistance and extension services to farmer 
organizations, although SAED’s own human resources are inadequate to sustain this past the USAID 
project life cycle. PCE’s partnership with SAED was crucial given SAED’s role as the lead government 
agency in supporting irrigated rice cultivation in the SRV. SAED helped with implementation of PCE 
activities. To create a sustainable basis for providing ongoing extension support to SRV rice farmers, 
PCE did extensive capacity building with both SAED and CGER. This included transferring the: 

…various technology packages such as “Le Chemin du Bon Riz”, the quality monitoring 
framework and the cloud based farmer data management system. In the SRV the project 
also partnered with Centres de Gestion et d’Economie Rurale (CGER), a team of financial 
analysts managed by SAED, to improve its databases and include farmer monitoring and 
profiling capacities that go beyond the monitoring of seasonal loans.39 

PCE had partnerships with CNCAS on contractualization, CNAAS on crop insurance, and Locafrique on 
cost sharing for agricultural machinery leasing. To increase competition and therefore availability and 
affordability of bank lending, PCE entered into partnerships with other banks, most notably BNDE, to 
expand their agricultural loan portfolios. 

Equally important to scaling up were PCE’s partnerships with various farmer organizations in the SRV. 
Scaling up was facilitated by the fact that farmers receiving irrigated water were organized into either 
GIEs or water user associations around the infrastructure (unions hydraulique). PCE used these 
organizations to deliver its various trainings and support in the Chemin du Bon Riz, rice quality training, 
and distribution of rice quality measurement tools, as well as creating linkages for farmers with financial 
intermediaries and processors.  

Finally, as part of scaling to Matam and beyond, PCE partnered closely with the USAID Yaajeende 
project, which had been working closely with farmers in those areas. Both irrigation and input 
distribution networks are much weaker in those areas than in the SRV, and Yaajeende has been 
instrumental in innovating and expanding networks of community-based service providers (CBSPs) to fill 
gaps in input provision. This allowed for creating the foundations for further scaling of PCE’s various 
activities in the eastern SRV and in the Casamance, which are now taking place under the successor 
project to PCE, Ntaal Mbay. 

VI.  SCALING STRATEGY AND ACTIVITES 

A. Drivers of Introduction and Dissemination of GAPs, Quality 

There were two major drivers of scaling up of Sahel rice production in the SRV. These were the GOS’s 
commitment to rice self-sufficiency and the decision by multiple donors, especially USAID and JICA, to 
support increased domestic rice production with their own programming. In that context, the two 
organizations that took the lead in operationalizing that effort were PNAR on the GOS side and the 
USAID-supported PCE program. While donor support came from Japan, Korea, France, and Spain, as

well as the World Bank and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, USAID was widely acknowledged 
for playing the lead role. Interestingly enough, these agencies worked successfully together without a 
formal consultation or coordination mechanisms. Perhaps equally important were PCE’s partners on the 
farmers’ association side, whether union hydrauliques in grand and intermediate amenegements, or GIEs 
based in other irrigation groups.  

There were several drivers of adoption of CBR and better quality among producers. First, high prices 
were a major driver, because of both higher international prices and GOS efforts to incentivize farmers 
through price, import, and export controls. Second, subsidies on everything from inputs to machinery 
boosted profits for most farmers, at least those with the means or access to finance to afford those 
inputs and services. Third, successful experience with contre saison yields led to a steady switch to that 
season and some double cropping, and reinforced the possibility of increased yields and higher quality. 
Finally, many farmers interviewed expressed that they saw increasing yield and production as their 
patriotic duty, and are making efforts to support the GOS self-sufficiency policy. The favorable policy 
environment has reassured both farmers and private investors in the rice value chain that there is a 
“guaranteed” market for domestic rice (i.e., that there will be ongoing political and financial support). 
This has substantially reduced the risk perceived by investors, and, for that matter, donors, as well as 
lengthening the time horizon for investment. 

B. Adoption Rates, Variability, and Continuity 

Adoption of the GAPs contained in the Chemin Du Bon Riz and PCE’s efforts at improving quality 
control on the production side are difficult to measure. The surface area and number of producers with 
whom PCE worked directly or through its partners were fairly stable between 2010 and 2015 at 
14,000–16,000 ha and 14,000–16,000 farmers (clearly implying that average area per farmer was around 
1 ha). See Table 11. This probably accounts for about 20–25 percent of the farmers in the SRV, and 
closer to 30–35 percent in the Dagana area. Adoption rates within the population appear to be 
somewhat variable. While data on adoption of the CBR was not available and would be hard to 
measure, proxies exist. In Section III, Table 6C, which presents data on PCE partners, shows that the 
amounts spent per hectare on seeds, fertilizer, herbicide, and threshing were quite variable across 
farmer organizations. This suggests that adoption of the CBR might be equally variable. On the other 
hand, there are likely to have been spillover effects (i.e., adoption by non-participants), so the impact is 
likely on balance to be much greater.

Scale-up in the areas of value chain strengthening shows particularly strong results. As noted above, 
certified seed production has expanded steadily, though would need to expand further to cover all 
farmers in the delta part of the SRV. According to PCE’s own data, in FY 2014, 26,530 hectares were 
being farmed under contractualization across all crops, with probably around half in irrigated rice. 
Further spread of contractualization is limited by CNCAS’s own capital limits—as of early 2016 it was 

Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal  

38 

 

looking for further capital increases—as well as the limitations of the existing versions of crop insurance. 
Farmers will also need to be fully insured from adverse events, especially in the hivernale season with 
the increased frequency of floods, damaging rain, and bird and pest attacks. Until that happens, it is likely 
that more farmers will fall back into arrears, becoming ineligible for credit, and many others will be less 
eager to produce in the hivernale season. The same is true of the timeliness of bank credit approval; as 
of this coming crop year (2016–2017), CNCAS was willing to experiment with approving credit for the 
entire year, versus the current practice of season by season.  

Quality processing capacity (i.e., big mills) has scaled significantly, and now appears to have excess 
capacity. Some of the excess capacity is clearly due to poor business decisions by Vital Agro-Industries, 
the largest miller as measured by capacity. Vital expected to have significant rice production of its own 
to process, but the land allocated to it proved to be not suitable for rice. On the upside, this 
development stimulated Vital to be the industry leader in early adoption of contractualization, both 
directly with its own producers and through CNCAS. It is unclear why many farmers still prefer to sell 
to the small décortiqueses. One explanation is that it saves on transportation costs; another may be that 
décortiqueses can pay more since they have lower processing costs, while there remains a significant 
rural market that is willing to pay less for lower quality. It may be the case that until retail prices are 
decontrolled and can rise, even with excess demand from processors and importers, farmers will 
continue to prefer the smaller processors.  

Mechanization now appears to be at full scale in Dagana and Podor, and is clearly one of the success 
stories of PCE and GOS efforts. However, according to LocAfrique, the Dagana market is now 
saturated. This has had an important impact on improving yields by allowing farmers to plant and harvest 
on time, increasing the length of the growing season and allowing for harvesting at the optimal time. 

Taken together, all of these interventions created a virtuous spiral and snowball effect that, after four 
years of investments (2010–2013) reached critical mass in 2014. Whereas both yields and hectares 
under rice cultivation were relatively flat between 2010 and 2013, both yields and hectares under 
cultivation increased in 2014 and 2015, though this was somewhat offset by adverse weather and pest 
attacks in the hivernale season leading to declining planting in that season. While it is highly likely that 
the cumulative and combined efforts of the GOS, PCE, and other donors contributed heavily to these 
results, it is impossible to distinguish how much of the surge in production in the last two years was 
from the GOS’s injection of funds into CNCAS to finance debt forgiveness or its additional lending for 
commercialization and equipment. It is difficult to know exactly what production levels were in those 
two years, as there are widespread reports that SAED and other data collection agencies were under 
significant political pressure to show results for the increased expenditures associated with subsidies and 
support for CNCAS. The reported figures show over 63,000 hectares under cultivation in 2015 and 
yields of around 7 mt/ha, up from 6.4 mt/ha in 2013. The net result was a recorded increase in rice 
production of 100,000 mt of paddy, but this figure, and the underlying determinants in yields and area, 
may be exaggerated by as much as 50 percent. 

C. Sustainability, Scaling, and Handoff to Commercial or Other Actors 

The ability to take over sustaining and continuing scaling in the SRV and beyond is currently being put in 
place. Because seed multiplication is being done by farmer cooperatives and other inputs are provided 
principally by the GOS, ISRA, or AfricaRice, there is no upstream actor in place to drive or sustain 
scaling. In the Dagana and Podor regions, where scaling has largely occurred, downstream actors are 
now driving scaling. These are principally the large, commercial millers, supported by SAED and the 
CNCAS, with private credit playing a growing role. These actors are more than capable of both 
sustaining the scale already achieved and filling in scale to the other 50 percent of farmers. However, 
this will depend on resolving the remaining challenges in access to credit and insurance, storage facilities, 

Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal

and persuading farmers to sell to millers versus décortiqueses. CNCAS in particular is limited by the size 
of its capital in the amount of loans it can extend, especially now that it has expanded into capital 
investment in mechanization and processing. 

There are neither commercial nor other actors with the capacity or interest to scale up rice production 
in the rest of the SRV (e.g. Matam and further east) or in rainfed areas in other parts of Senegal, 
principally the Casamance. USAID has recognized and accordingly has funded the Ntaal Mbay project, a 
successor to PCE, to driving scale up in both areas. Scaling up in the upper parts of the SRV will be 
more challenging as the existing irrigation infrastructure and value chains are much less dense. The land 
is less suitable for rice versus much more profitable horticulture crops like tomatoes and onions. 
Perhaps more importantly, crop insurance has not yet been shown to work and still needs to be 
tweaked, a major challenge throughout the SRV. 

Scaling up in the Casamance will prove much more challenging because of the greater risks involved with 
rainfed rice, lack of any existing milling capacity, and the fact that relatively few farmers currently 
produce a commercial surplus. In addition, rice also has to compete with maize and groundnuts. As a 
result, there are neither downstream processing nor milling capacity nor marketing linkages to Dakar or 
other urban areas. It is likely that the package of innovations scaled in the SRV will have to be modified 
or adapted, and potentially new ones innovated. PCE’s approach of working simultaneously on supply 
and demand (i.e., push and pull) and addressing binding constraints iteratively, is clearly the right overall 
approach and is being applied by Ntaal Mbay. Whether rain index insurance, even subsidized by the 
GOS, can be made to work remains to be seen. Quality mechanized processing will have to be 
introduced along with downstream linkages though the demand is clearly there.  

D.  Potential Scale of Adoption 

Given the challenges present with rainfed rice, this study was confined to the scaling up potential in the 
SRV. Demand for rice is clearly not an issue, given that there is huge potential for import substitution in 
the rice market in Senegal and the GOS is committed to controlling imports and prices, as necessary, to 
ensure the profitability of domestic production. Therefore the question is what is the potential on the 
supply side?  

Supply is largely constrained by how much irrigated land there is (i.e., irrigation infrastructure). 
Currently around 60,000 ha have access to irrigation for growing rice. It is difficult to get a precise 
estimate of how much additional land already has irrigation infrastructure in place that needs to be 
rehabilitated, and how much new land could be utilized. According to interviews, SAED personnel 
believe that up to an additional 60,000 ha could be rehabilitated. According to an interview with the 
head of the PNAR and other sources,40 the total potential in the SRV is 240,000 ha.  

The GOS has committed to a long-term policy of encouraging donors to fund new investment in and 
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure in the SRV. This already met with great success between 2008 
and 2015, with the World Bank, French Agency for Development, and Gulf Cooperation Council all 
providing funds to SAED for significant new investment and rehabilitation. Whether additional donor 
funds will be available remains to be seen, and the GOS itself does not have funding for this kind of 
expense. Until funds materialize, the goal of 120,000, let alone 240,000 hectares, is a long way off.

Intensive scaling is more likely to be possible and viable in the short to medium run (i.e., the next three 
to five years). The Sahel varieties in use have yield potential of 10–12 mt/ha depending on the variety. 
While some farmers are getting 8–10 mt/ha, the majority are in the 6–8 mt/ha range (in saison chaud), 
and some are getting still less. If credit availability continues to increase, so that more farmers are able 
to afford the inputs and services necessary, and other constraints are addressed, moving average yields 
up to 7–8 mt/ha is certainly possible. However, the impact of this on total annual production may be 
limited, as unless the increasing problems with pests and adverse weather in the hivernale can be 
addressed, double cropping may be limited or even decrease. 

In addition to pests, adverse weather, and access to credit, constraints that need to be addressed in 
order to increase yields include: increased access to storage; willingness of farmers to sell to large 
processors; extending what is covered by crop insurance; and improving servicing and maintenance of 
machinery. Further scaling will also depend on domestic and world prices continuing to remain near or 
above current levels. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Before turning to conclusions it is important to note that the story of scaling up of Sahel rice is atypical 
in several ways. First, maximum potential scale was and remains constrained by the extent of irrigation 
infrastructure. In this case, current scale is probably limited to 120,000 hectares and some multiple of 
that in terms of numbers of farmer households affected (i.e., a few hundred thousand farmers at best). 
Though current efforts are being made to extend what was done in the SRV to other rice growing areas 
of Senegal, the applicability of what was done with irrigated rice to rainfed areas remains to be seen. 
Second, scaling up has taken place in two distinct and temporally disparate phases. Sahel rice seed was 
first introduced in the SRV in 1994 and was widely adopted by most farmers by 2000. As a result of the 
decline of the irrigated rice value chain, the yield potential of Sahel rice was not realized at that time. 
Instead, after a decade-long hiatus, this potential has been largely realized by the scaling up of a package 
of innovations between 2010 and 2015 (and is ongoing) that included both GAPs and strengthening the 
value chain. This latter effort was driven by the efforts of the USAID-supported PCE, in partnership with 
other donors and the GOS. This study focuses on those post-2010 efforts led by PCE, which involved a 
mix of improving agricultural practices and rehabilitating and strengthening the rice value chain and 
relevant aspects of the rice market system. 

PCE identified the immediate obstacles to increased production, prices, and sales and how to address 
these. The key elements were to address constraints on supply and demand and increase quality in both 
production and processing. In other words, PCE worked both on “push” factors to increase yields, area 
planted, production, and quality, and on “pull” factors to increase demand. Doing these simultaneously 
proved to be important, as increased supply without demand made no sense, and vice-versa. When the 
impact of those activities met new obstacles to further scale, PCE and its partners addressed those in 
turn. Thus what was ‘scaled’ was inter alia the production and certification of quality seed, the use of 
certified seed, GAPs, increasing the availability and affordability of machinery services, large-scale quality 
commercial rice milling, and a whole set of financial innovations. Perhaps most important was this overall 
‘virtuous spiral’ approach to scaling.  

These activities took a few years to implement and have a perceivable effect. Efforts to increase rice 
production by the GOS, PCE and others began in 2009–2010, but there was almost no increase in area, 
yield, production, or quality until 2013–2014. At that point the multi-pronged strategy reached critical 
mass in both scale and scope (e.g., there was adequate supply of both certified rice seed and processing 
capacity to allow for a significant increase in production). This was complemented, importantly, by a 

Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal  

41 

 

program of debt forgiveness and an injection of additional capital by the GOS to increase the availability 
of credit throughout the value chain.  

The greatest sources of increase in yields were the shift from hivernale to saison chaud planting, use of 
certified seed, and farmers’ preparing their land, planting, and harvesting at optimal times. Respecting the 
crop calendar was made possible through increased access to and more timely availability of credit and 
greater availability of machinery services. In turn, greater availability of credit was significantly driven by 
financial innovations introduced by PCE and its partners, principally crop insurance and 
contractualization. As is perhaps obvious, this required a layered approach, as one innovation built upon 
another. 

A.  Characteristics of the Innovation 

It is difficult to draw any lessons from the irrigated rice case about the characteristics of innovations that 
facilitate scaling up because it was large and diverse package of innovations. For Sahel rice alone, it is 
clear that getting the benefits of Sahel rice required significant changes in agricultural practices by 
farmers, especially the timeliness of the various activities during the season. Helping farmers to acquire 
these GAPs required a significant investment of time; in most cases it appears to take a farmer several 
seasons to master the new approaches. As no existing actor, public or private, had the resources or 
capacity to provide the necessary technical assistance and extension services, this had to be provided by 
donor-funded projects. While PCE did significant capacity building with SAED and other relevant actors, 
it remains unclear whether any of them can either take over this role or provide such support on an 
ongoing basis.  

B. Incentives and the Business Case 

The success in helping farmers adopt GAPs and in getting other value chain actors to adopt new 
innovations is clearly linked to the fact that adopting these innovations has been profitable for several 
key actors. This includes seed multipliers, rice farmers, and (to a lesser extent) rice processors. Both 
seed multipliers and rice farmers have very solid returns on investment, especially given current 
international and domestic rice prices and subsidies on inputs. While some rice processors are clearly 
doing well and making money, the inability of others to find adequate supplies of rice suggests that many 
farmers still find it more profitable or preferable to use local décortiqueses. 

Risk has also clearly played a role in farmers’ decisions and those of other actors. One of the major 
appeals of several of the GAPs adopted—certified seed, respecting the crop calendar, changing to the 
saison chaud—is that they have decreased the risk of a poor harvest. While crop insurance was 
intended to decrease risk for both CNCAS and farmers, in its current form it has largely worked only 
for CNCAS.  

C. Context 

The context in Senegal played an essential role in scaling up. Extensive irrigation infrastructure already 
existed and the use of irrigation seriously mitigated risk to all actors in the value chain. Even prior to 
2010, many rice farmers were producing at least a small surplus and were commercially orientated.  
Those who could afford it were accustomed to using improved seed varieties, fertilizer, and other 
capital-intensive inputs; employing machinery services; and selling in commercial markets. Even those 
who could not afford all of these used some of these inputs and aspired to use more. The majority of 
rice farmers were already organized into farmers’ organizations based on “hydraulic unions” which 
greatly facilitated provision of inputs, extension services, market linkages, and technical assistance; 

Scaling Up of Sahel Rice Varieties in Senegal  

42 

 

others were members of GIEs or other farmers’ organizations. Without these farmer organizations, 
scaling up in the SRV would have been much more difficult, expensive, and time consuming; yet there 
are many contexts where such organizations are nonexistent or neither as strong or widespread as they 
were in the SRV.  

World and domestic prices for rice have been consistently high since the food crisis of 2008, making a 
strong business case for irrigated rice. Close physical proximity to key urban markets like Dakar was 
helpful, as well as excess demand for rice and the opportunity for import substitution. While the rice 
value chain had notable weaknesses at the start of scaling, especially seed supply, certification and 
processing, many of the institutions necessary were in place to some degree (e.g., mechanized services 
providers, processing, input distribution, access to credit). This stands in marked contrast to, just for 
example, the situation with rain-fed rice in the Casamance region of Senegal. 

Even though PCE emphasized wherever possible commercial pathways, the huge role of the GOS in the 
irrigated rice value chain meant that the public sector played a key role. Overall strong GOS policy 
support for rice self-sufficiency has provided private investors with a high comfort level for investment 
in the sector. Government subsidies on inputs, credit, insurance, and purchases of machinery improved 
returns and lowered risks for many actors, even though rice production was already profitable for 
farmers. At the same time, the GOS affected price setting, which has distorted incentives, especially for 
wholesalers and processors, and exaggerated and inaccurate statistics have adversely affected planning 
by rice farmers and processors.  

D. Drivers of Adoption and Scaling Strategy 

The major drivers of scaling up at the macro level were GOS policy and programs around rice self-
sufficiency, USAID’s PCE program, and the complementary activities of other donors. At the micro level, 
the fact that irrigated rice has been profitable and competitive with imports since the world food crisis 
has been key. This was supported by the large potential market based on import substitution. 

In terms of scaling up strategy, the key aspects that underlay the success of PCE’s scaling up were: 

  Using a push-pull approach by helping producers to increase yields, production, and quality; 

increasing market demand through facilitating linkages to processors and distributors; and 
strengthening those downstream institutions. 

  Kick starting private upstream and downstream investment through subsidies, risk mitigation, 

and market facilitation. PCE’s support for agricultural machinery leasing through Locafrique and 
innovating crop insurance with the GOS are examples. 

  Translating this push/pull and kick starting into a virtuous spiral that by 2014–2015 has become 

increasingly self-generating. 

  Aligning the incentives for farmers, banks, processors, machinery services, and wholesalers so 

that everyone makes money. In some cases in Senegal, this has been complicated by GOS-
induced distortions of prices and margins at various stages of the value chain. The fact that 
profitability for processors still remains a mixed situation may affect scaling in the future. 

  Addressing risk for key actors. This was particularly true for banks (e.g., CNCAS) and 

processors and was addressed through the innovations of contractualization, crop insurance, 
and the use of a warehouse receipts system. As noted above, reducing risks for farmers is still a 
work in progress.

LESSONS LEARNED  

A. General Lessons 

Despite the relatively small potential scale and the many favorable aspects of the SRV context, the Sahel 
rice case has many important and positive lessons for scaling up of agricultural innovations through 
commercial pathways.  

The principal lesson from this case is that introducing a new technology like improved seed varieties is 
only a small part of what needs to be done if its potential benefits for yield, production, and food 
security are to be realized, let alone at scale and sustainably. The entire value chain needs to be in place.  

Second, a virtuous spiral/snowball approach can be highly effective in addressing constraints on scaling 
sequentially. However, to implement this effectively requires flexibility in annual work planning with a 
strong formal and informal monitoring system that can both identify new constraints as they become 
binding and assess progress in addressing existing constraints. 

Third, there is often a need for complementary or supporting innovations in addition to new seeds (or 
other inputs) and GAPs. In this case, financial innovation (e.g., contractualization) was probably the most 
important complementary innovation, even if other innovations, such as crop insurance, remain works in 
progress. 

Fourth, context matters, a lot. A context where there is already a market orientation, most value chain 
institutions are in place (even if quite weak), and risks are lower because of irrigation is quite different 
from scaling in a situation where those factors are not present. Similarly, a context where there is a 
huge existing demand and a potential market (in this case because of the possibility of import 
substitution) is very different from where demand is small, has to be created, and where there is a risk 
of increased supply putting downward pressure on prices. 

Fifth, a supportive policy environment makes a huge difference. This was the case not only in terms of 
specific programs and subsidies, but in creating an overall favorable atmosphere. While subsidies can 
(and in this case have) created distortions, their role in reducing the risks of adoption and crowding in 
the private sector, if done well, is undeniable. 

Sixth, scaling is multi-dimensional. In this case, increases in yield were largely driven by the time 
dimension of scaling up. New technology and practices impact the ability of farmers to complete the 
various activities of the crop cycle at the optimal times (i.e., timeliness) and has been shown in many 
research studies to be a major influence on yields. Yields improve as farmers are able to plant two crops 
per year, in some cases on the same land. Scaling up over space (i.e., greater area), while usually how 
one thinks about scaling, in this case was more limited, by access to both irrigation and credit. 

Seventh, it is key for commercial scaling not only to make sure that production is profitable for farmers 
and downstream and upstream actors, but it is perhaps even more important to reduce risk. Crop 
insurance can help, but the Senegal case shows there are many challenges in making this viable and 
sustainable, even with government support. In this case, GOS support, programs, and subsidies played a 
key role. While it is natural to treat subsidies as unsustainable, in this case there is both the political will 
and fiscal space to sustain these in the medium term, though this could change if world fertilizer or rice 
prices change. 

Finally, innovations whose adoption takes substantial technical assistance and extension support may be 
hard to make sustainable. In the case of Senegal, PCE has worked hard to embed the needed capacity in

SAED, hydraulic unions, and other farmer organizations. However, whether these organizations have 
sufficient human resources and institutional capacity to sustain this at the scale needed remains to be 
seen.  

B. Lessons for USAID and Other Donors 

From the perspective of USAID, there are a number of larger lessons, some of which duplicate those 
listed above. These are: 

1.  The innovation, or package of innovations, cannot easily be identified in advance but are more 

likely to reveal themselves as constraints and obstacles to scaling a basic innovation. Flexibility in 
both what and how scaling is conducted is preferable. 

2.  Actual potential scale can be significantly below potential scale based on agro-ecological 

considerations alone. Access to irrigation, inputs, markets, credit, labor, and other resources all 
can significantly constrain actual potential scale. 

3.  Scaling is multi-dimensional, and strategies need to consider the relative importance of each 

dimension, even though this can evolve in unpredictable ways based on the responses of various 
private sector actors. The intensive impact of scaling (e.g., increasing yields) can be as important 
as extensive scaling (e.g., spreading to more farmers, more surface area cultivated). Time and 
timeliness can be a key dimension of both types of scaling, and should be an explicit focus. 

4.  A scaling up strategy that combines three metaphors—virtuous spiral, snowball, and push-pull—

can be highly effective in reaching critical mass for scaling and allowing scaling to become 
significantly self-generating. At the same time, it appears that there may be stages or thresholds 
of scaling in some cases, at which point new constraints appear that impede further self-
generating scaling. Addressing these often involves public goods or externalities that private 
actors may not have the resources or incentives to address themselves. 

5.  Commercial ownership and sustainability can be achieved by combining kick starting private 

sector involvement with an explicit view to creating sustainable institutions that can function at 
scale. This requires an ongoing process of identifying bottlenecks and incentives, providing some 
initial incentives and risk mitigation, and iterative monitoring and problem solving. 

6.  Focusing on risk for all actors is equally important as profitability. Key risks that can and should 

be addressed include: timely, affordable, and accessible inputs and mechanization; affordable, 
timely access to credit, liquidity, and insurance throughout the value chain; and ensuring that 
there is demand for increased supply and supply for increased processing capacity and demand. 
Public or donor subsidies for inputs, credit, and services can be critical for kick starting 
increased production and private investment in key parts of the value chain, but as time goes on 
can create distortions that inhibit private sector efforts from snowballing and becoming self-
generating. This was the case with GOS subsidies on agricultural machinery purchases, which 
undercut private efforts. 

7.  Aligning with public sector strategies and programs, as PCE did, is both essential and 

problematic. It often brings as many challenges as it does benefits. The GOS has regularly 
exaggerated rice performance for political reasons even though this has significantly complicated 
planning for farmers, processors, seed producers, donors, and others. Nonetheless, PCE could 
not have achieved its successes if it had not worked effectively with the government, and this 
often required substantial and ongoing advocacy and consultation. Further, governments are not 
monolithic and can have different interests varying across ministries, agencies, and parastatals. In

this case, the Ministry of Agriculture wanted to ensure high prices for farmers to encourage 
production, whereas the Ministry of Commerce wanted low consumer prices. The result has 
been a squeeze on margins for processors, wholesalers, and importers. 

8.  Even in a highly favorable environment like the SRV (e.g., an existing value chain, GOS support, 

access to irrigation), it can take four to five years to achieve results and for self-generating 
scaling to begin. Based on this case, donors should target (and be able to reach) 20–35 percent 
scale (i.e., critical mass). However, even this may be sufficient only to reach the next plateau, in 
this case around 50 percent of potential scale. 

9.  Scaling up, especially when it requires strengthening multiple aspects of the value chain and 

market system, is expensive and, even at this limited scale, beyond the resources of one donor. 
USAID was in the lead and was able to scale a number of innovations. Nonetheless PCE’s efforts 
would have had little impact without the substantial complementary assistance from French, 
Spanish (warehouses), Japanese (crop and milling quality equipment), and World Bank (irrigation 
infrastructure) sources. Interestingly enough, this functioned extremely well without formal 
coordination mechanisms, as each donor took a niche and pursued it without duplication. 

10.  Despite these clear successes, a number of challenges remain to further scaling. PCE’s follow-up 

project, Ntaal Mbay, is addressing these, including the need for increased warehouse storage, 
problems with the design of crop insurance, the continued predominance of local processors, 
and lack of servicing and maintenance for the much larger supply of agricultural machinery. At 
least some of these issues are due to distortions introduced by the sector-wide support policies 
of the GOS (e.g., machinery subsidies).
