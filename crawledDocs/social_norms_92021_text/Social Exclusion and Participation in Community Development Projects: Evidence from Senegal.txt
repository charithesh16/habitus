Abstract

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

This  article  seeks  to  provide  a  new  insight  into  the  debate  about  participation  through  a  com-
prehensive analysis of  the mechanisms at play behind community participation. The combined use
of  the concepts of  social exclusion and of  game theory is explored as a dynamic and innovative
analytical  tool  to  understand  participatory  processes  in  community  development  projects.  The
framework  is  tested  against  the  analysis  of  participation  in  an  NGO-led  community  project  in
Senegal. Policy implications point to a need to unravel the complexity of  participation to design
more effective and sustainable community development projects.

Introduction
Participation  is  a  highly  fashionable  term  in  current  development  practice
and is now practically 
s, devel-
opment  discourse  emphasized  the  role  of  the  state  and  of  international
agencies  in  delivering  development  to  people.  This  blueprint  approach
was progressively challenged because of  its failure to effectively address the
underlying causes of poverty. In this context, community participation emerged
as  the  new  paradigm  of  the  development  process.  The  rationale  behind
participation  is  multifold:  increased  participation  is  supposed  to  promote
greater efﬁciency, more accountability and transparency, enhanced ownership
and  empowerment.  Ultimately,  participation  is  supposed  to  be  the  key  to
genuine  and  sustainable  poverty  alleviation  by  shifting  power  to  those  who
are “local and poor” (Chambers, in Nelson and Wright 

Although a very laudable reorientation of  development practice, partici-
pation has shown its limitations, especially in terms of  its ability to avoid the

participatory  projects  ended  up  replicating  the  same  errors  as  top–down
projects. In particular, the basic problem of  not being able to arouse popular
participation plagues most community initiatives. Understanding participation
and its different mechanisms is essential to analyse the pitfalls of  participatory
projects, and to improve their design.

Behind the buzzword of  participation lies a wide range of  processes and
mechanisms, all of  which are context-speciﬁc and have a different impact on
the overall performance of  participation. These mechanisms, inherent to the
participatory process, remain under-researched areas in development literature.
This article attempts to make a contribution to ﬁlling this gap by examining
the exclusionary processes at play in participatory projects.

In this exercise, two analytical tools are used simultaneously. A few studies
have  attempted  to  draw  a  link  between  social  exclusion  and  participation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
). In addition, this article uses game theory to illustrate social
 
(Haan 

exclusion processes within community development projects. The advantage
of  using  both  these  tools  is  that  it  provides  a  comprehensive,  visual  and
dynamic picture of  participatory processes. The concept of  social exclusion
helps to locate exclusionary processes and possible leverage points for policy
intervention while game theory explains the rational push and pull factors of
social exclusion at the community level. Through its simple representation,
game theory also offers a participation matrix on which to locate and evalu-
ate projects according to their participatory achievements.

The ambiguities of  participation
Participation  has  proven  to  be  “a  most  difﬁcult  and  elusive  goal  to  attain”
(Eicher  and  Staatz 
 s,  the  debate  was  mostly  con-
centrated on the objectives of  participation—whether it was sought as an end
in itself  or as a means to an end ( Michener 
). It was found that many
community  projects  emphasized  participatory  processes  not  for  the  sake  of
participation and its related empowerment objectives, but more as a market-
ing tool to attract funding or to promote a speciﬁc agenda.

).  In  the  early 

More  recently,  the  critical  issue  of  power  within  participatory  processes
became prominent in the debate, in particular “the exclusionary as well as
the  inclusionary  nature  of  participation”  (Cleaver,  in  Cooke  and  Kothari
). The ambiguities of  participation are not only exogenous (a misuse of

the concept), but very much endogenous: participatory processes in themselves
 
 
 
 
are problematic.

participation: health, knowledge and skills, and human rights among others.

participation, Plummer (
) identiﬁes several factors affecting participation:
skills and knowledge, employment, education and literacy, cultural beliefs and
practices, gender, social and political marginalization are all factors that can
impact on the level of  participation in the activities of  municipalities.

Furthermore,  Kapoor  (

)  argues  that  participatory  techniques  are
parachuted on communities with little investigation of  their internal divisions
or  patterns  of  domination  and  exclusion.  Yet  participation  in  community
development  projects  does  occur  in  very  complex  contexts,  where  social,
economic, cultural, religious and other features of  social life shape the way
people respond to external interventions. Avoiding the analysis of  the tensions
created  by  politics,  power,  legitimization,  empowerment  and  panopticism
(i.e.  behaviours  induced  by  mutual  surveillance  and  discipline  within  the
community)  is  not  only  unrealistic  but  greatly  limits  participation  as  an
empowering tool.

The fact that participation depends on many variables at the community
level  and  that  its  practice  is  intimately  linked  with  exclusion  and  power
conﬁrms  the  need  for  an  analysis  “on  whether  and  how  the  structures  of
participatory  projects  include/protect/secure  the  interests  of  poor  people”
(Cleaver,  in  Cooke  and  Kothari 
).  In  fact,  a  comprehensive  analysis  of
participation acknowledges and investigates the dynamics of conﬂict, consensus-
building and decision-making that create patterns of  inclusion and exclusion
within communities.

Communities and livelihood strategies are heterogeneous
Unlimited faith in participation as an empowering tool is very often driven
by a misunderstanding of  the nature of  communities and a neglect of  liveli-
 
 
 
 
 
1
hood strategies at the community level.
  The assumption that communities
are  homogeneous  entities,  and  hence  that  community  participation  is  un-
equivocal,  is  fairly  common  among  development  practitioners.  Contrasted
livelihood  strategies  at  the  community  level  are  rarely  explored,  and  this
obscures the debate over participation. In fact, experience shows that com-
munities are often little more than a mere juxtaposition of  individuals with
divergent  interests,  or  households  with  unrelated—if  not  confrontational—
livelihood strategies. “More realistically, we may see the community as the site
of  both solidarity and conﬂict, shifting alliances, power and social structures.”
(Cleaver, in Cooke and Kothari 

A few authors acknowledge the link between community participation and
livelihood  strategies.  Indeed,  within  a  relatively  small  community,  diversity
prevails  and  while  some  individuals  or  households  will  ﬁnd  it  beneﬁcial  to
take  part  in  a  development  project,  others  may  perceive  participation  ill-
adapted  or  even  detrimental  to  their  livelihood  strategies.  “A  diversity  per-
spective would recognise that some groups might be unable to, or unwilling
to  participate  themselves,  and  to  work  through  representative  structures,
while others may choose to be different or to spurn mainstream development

them,  and  that  “non-participation  and  non-compliance  may  be  both  a
‘rational’ strategy and an unconscious practice embedded in routine, social
norms and the acceptance of  the status quo” (Cleaver, in Cooke and Kothari
).


In  this  diversity  perspective,  the  task  is  not  to  impose  participation  on
unwilling community members but to identify the factors that exclude people
when they actively seek to participate.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Social exclusion as a multifaceted process
If  participation is understood as inclusion at different stages in the develop-
ment  process,  then  exclusion  relates  to  the  mechanisms  through  which
participation  is  hampered.  As  seen  earlier,  participation  and,  reciprocally,
non-participation operate through the multiple identities borne by commu-
nity  members  as  economic  but  also  political,  cultural  or  social  agents  with
varying  capital  and  capabilities.  Over  time,  livelihood  strategies  also  deter-
mine the costs and beneﬁts of  non-participation, and whether people will be
able or willing to participate. Hence, non-participation can only be analysed
through  a  ﬂexible  tool  that  integrates  all  these  multiple  dimensions.  The
emphasis is on the different variables that may hamper participation and on
the dynamic processes that lead to exclusion from participation.

Social  exclusion  refers  to  the  state  of  multiple  deprivation  or  “lack  of
participation  in  key  aspects  of  society”  (Hills 
),  but  also  to  the
processes leading to it. The concept encompasses the multidimensional aspects
of  poverty, from cash income to a wide range of  indicators of  deprivation or
inability to participate in contemporary society (Hills 
). The focus
suggested  by  social  exclusion  is  on  the  processes  that  generate  exclusion  or
inclusion  and  on  the  social  factors  that  combine  and  interact  to  produce
social exclusion (Cartaya 

).

Game Theory and Social Exclusion as an Integrated Tool to 
Analyse Participation

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Game theory offers a dynamic tool . . .
A major criticism of  social exclusion as a concept is that it is all-encompassing
and  therefore  difﬁcult  to  operationalize.  Most  frameworks  of  analysis  for
social exclusion remain either descriptive or too confusing to be applicable
on  the  ground.  The  issue  is  to  incorporate  the  concept  of  social  exclusion
into a more dynamic and systematic framework that remains simple in its
 
 
 
 
representation. In the search for a tool that would capture the rational aspect
of  (non-)participation, game theory appears to be enlightening.

Game theory highlights the rational mechanisms underpinning individual
decision-making in a collective action contributing to the common good. In
this case, the game can help to understand how participation in, or exclusion

the members of  a community in which a development project is introduced
are either to be excluded (not to participate), or to be included (to participate).

It seems that this complements the concepts of participation and social exclu-
sion as it allows the articulation of  the push and pull factors of  participation
or exclusion, determined by “the changing social position of  individuals over
life  courses, . . . the  variable  costs  and  beneﬁts  of  differently  placed  people,
[the]  contending  and  complementary  concerns  with  production  and
reproduction . . . [that] shape people’s willingness and ability to participate”
(Cleaver, in Cooke and Kothari 

The attraction of  game theory lies in its simple representation of  a variety
). “The actions of  the ﬁrst player
of  situations in a single table (see ﬁgure 

form the rows, and the actions of  the second player the columns, of  a matrix.
The entries in the matrix are two numbers representing the utility or payoff
to the ﬁrst and second player respectively” (Levine 

A second feature of  game theory is that it shows how decision-making at
the individual level is supported by a rational calculus of  personal gains (or
capabilities) against the pursuit of  the common good. This rational calculus
depends on the different characteristics of  the community and its members.
We  will explore this in the next section.

. . . While social exclusion variables provide a wide range of  explanations for 
participatory processes
Game  theory  can  be  adapted  to  the  analysis  of  any  process,  provided  that
relevant  variables  feed  into  it.  In  our  case,  social  exclusion  variables  give
shape to game theory and ensure a more comprehensive analysis of  participa-
tion. The methodology proposed is to locate participatory patterns through
game  theory  (whether  groups  are  included  or  excluded),  and  then  use  the
social exclusion variables to understand the reasons behind these processes.

to the project under scrutiny. The aim is to provide a comprehensive but by no
means exhaustive list of  variables that can explain patterns of  participation
or of  social exclusion.

This social exclusion ﬁlter is meant to be used for the analysis of  partici-
pation  in  community  projects,  in  order  to  increase  awareness  about  all  the
potential barriers to participation. The most relevant variables can be identiﬁed
on a case-by-case basis and worked upon to minimize social exclusion.

 
 
 
 
 

Social Exclusion and Participation: Evidence from Senegal

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Background
Many development NGOs, including ENDA Graf  Sahel in Senegal, endea-
vour  to  promote  and  ensure  community  participation  in  all  their  activities.
One of  ENDA Graf  Sahel’s projects in the region of  Thies (situated 
 km
away from the capital Dakar) will serve as the example for this study. ENDA
Graf  Sahel works according to community participation principles, involving
local  communities  from  the  conception  of  the  projects  right  up  to  their
implementation.  The  planning  procedure  is  reversed:  local  communities
come up to the NGO with their problems, and the NGO allocates them a
social worker who facilitates the ﬁnding of  appropriate solutions from within
the community. “This shift occurred at the same time as we realised that the
population was composed of actors . . . More recently, we reversed our concep-
tualisation:  participation  is  perceived  as  our  participation  to  actions  under-
taken by the ‘popular actors’ [
], which leads us to associate to
the concept [of  participation] notions such as initiative, facilitation or com-
munication” (ENDA Graf  Sahel

The  participatory  project  under  scrutiny 

 a
microﬁnance institution in a rural community of  Senegal. The local NGO
ENDA Graf  Sahel, through its afﬁliate GRAIM, had received a £
 grant
for  agricultural  producers.  After  consulting  the  municipal  authorities  and
members of  the community, it was decided that opening the ﬁrst rural credit
and  savings  bank  in  the  municipality  (Caisse  Populaire  d’Epargne  et  de
 
 
 
 
Crédit) was the best use of  this grant. The service provided was intended to
beneﬁt a total of  
 km away from Dakar). ENDA
 
 
 
 
 
Graf  Sahel  was  the  technical  adviser,  but—apart  from  the  initial  £,
grant for credit allocation—did not have a separate budget for the setting-up
of  the microﬁnance institution; that was to be supported by the community.
The municipality was supporting the initiative politically and technically. A
ﬁrst steering committee was created with local leaders chosen by ENDA Graf
Sahel with advice from the municipal authorities.

The assumption was that the creation of  the microﬁnance institution was
responding to a need expressed by the community. At the time of  ﬁeldwork,
the microﬁnance institution project had been ofﬁcially launched a few months
before, and savings books were being sold. However, the preceding six months

project, a steering committee composed of  politically marked members, and
a lack of  general trust in the management of  the project, rather than in its
intended objectives that were unanimously perceived beneﬁcial for the com-
mon good.

A careful analysis of  the community revealed widely different explanations
 
 
 
 
for  the  slow  progress  of  the  project.  These  revolved  around  the  many
internal divisions and multiple exclusionary features at the community and
individual levels hampering participation and progress of  the project.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Social exclusion patterns in the ﬁrst phase of  the project
For our purpose, the ﬁrst phase of  the project, characterized by slow progress
and low participation, will be considered as a “bad” project situation. At this
stage, the project was perceived as ill-adapted to the needs of  the community
with costs outweighing beneﬁts, or simply ill-designed. Figure 
illustrates the
inclusion and exclusion processes and their related gains in a “bad” project
situation. Now that the different participatory patterns are illustrated through
game theory, social exclusion variables can help to understand participatory
patterns in the Senegalese project.

inadequacy to the felt needs of  the community. In this case, there is minimal
but equal beneﬁt for all ( ). The community participates because of  power

“pleasing  the  foreigners”  type  of  behaviours,  preserving  the  status  of  the
community in the development agenda, etc.

This situation could be associated with the participatory pattern prevailing
right  at  the  start  of  the  project,  when  the  Parti  Socialiste  ( PS)  members
massively joined the ﬁrst steering committee. At the level of  this subgroup,

there  was  total  participation  despite  the  very  uncertain  development  gains
expected from the project. Participation at this early stage of  the project was
motivated by political interests rather than by the common good. Clientelist
arrangements possibly induced this pattern.

 
 
 
 
 



In  the  light  shaded  cell,  the
Non-participation can indicate the weakness of  a project.
 
 
 
 
 
project is perceived as weak and ill-adapted to local needs and therefore no
one takes part in it. This is a rational choice with a higher gain ( ) because
not  participating  in  the  project  means  not  wasting  time  at  meetings,  not
being asked for ﬁnancial or material contribution and being free to carry out
individual activities.

This situation can be illustrated by the participatory pattern exhibited by
the Christian subgroup of  the community. The ﬁrst impression of  this sub-
group  was  that  although  the  objectives  of  the  project  were  laudable,  its
management  was  biased  by  political  hijacking,  as  the  political  elite  was
almost exclusively Muslim. Hence, almost no Christian people took part in
the project. The only Christians to take part from the beginning were a couple,
the husband being a politician and the wife the president of  a community-
based  organization.  In  this  case,  the  exclusionary  potential  of  the  religious
variable was offset by the political and social characteristics of  the individuals.
This situation shows that at this stage the project was weakly designed since
it had not taken into account the exclusionary power of  political hijacking.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 



In  the  remaining  two  blank  cells,  a  group  of
Non-participation can even be beneﬁcial!
 
 
 
 
 
people chooses to participate (either through conscious choice or because of
political  pressure  and  clientelism).  They  will  not  directly  beneﬁt  from  the
project since it is ill-adapted to their needs, and they will suffer through loss
of  time  and  energy,  and  use  of  ﬁnancial  and  material  resources,  etc.  The
payoff  is therefore 
, i.e. inferior to the two other patterns. Gains could be
higher if  clientelist participation occurs; i.e. participation is a rational calcu-
lus made by community members against cash or kind compensations. The
other group members who choose to be / are excluded have a comparative
advantage because they do not suffer from the burdens of  participation and
can carry out their activities as usual. Their gain (
) is higher than in the
previous  pattern  ( ),  because  they  can  maximize  their  opportunities  at  the
expense of  the included group.

At the level of  the community, this was displayed clearly. Since the political
elite’s participation was triggered only by political interests with no commit-
ment  to  the  project  itself,  their  gains  were  only  measurable  in  terms  of
political power. They lost a lot of  time and energy attending meetings and
committing themselves to the steering committee. By comparison, the people
who  did  not  participate  or  who  acted  as  free-riders,  did  not  lose  anything
and actually saved a lot of  time and energy by excluding themselves from a
project which clearly needed ﬁne-tuning at this stage. Ironically, the people
who  might  have  liked  to  be  included  in  the  project  but  who  could  not

Social exclusion patterns in the second phase of  the project
The second phase of  the project, resulting from a number of  new measures
and  active  involvement  of  the  NGO  to  increase  awareness  and  enhance
facilitation will be considered as a “good” project situation. It is understood
that  a  “good”  project,  as  perceived  by  the  community,  is  not  necessarily
successful in avoiding the traditional pitfalls of  participation, as the present
example  will  illustrate.  Ultimately,  a  project  is  good  only  when  it  has  suc-
ceeded in removing all the barriers to genuine participation and acts on all
the potential social exclusion variables. Figure  maps the inclusionary and
exclusionary processes under a “good” project situation.

For social planners, the task is to move from a situation of  social exclusion
to  a  situation  of  optimal  participation.  These  two  extreme  situations  are
brieﬂy described here:

In  the  two  blank  cells,  a  group  within  the  community  is  included  in  the
project while another group is excluded either through activity by the former
or  through  deliberate  choice.  The  push  factors  to  exclude  a  group  of  the
community  from  participation  are:  expected  greater  beneﬁt  for  the  group
that  excludes  the  other,  social  and  economic  reasons,  gender  or  ethnic  dis-
crimination,  etc.  The  push  factors  to  exclude  oneself  (voluntary  exclusion)
can range from disagreement, social, political or religious opposition with the
other members of  the community, lack of  self-esteem, or “free-rider” strategy.
In  this  situation,  the  group  included  in  the  project  reaps  the  beneﬁts  ()
while  the  excluded  group  does  not  gain  or  lose  anything  (
).  However,  the

latter loses out compared with the previous pattern ( ) because of  increased
inequality between the two groups.

In  the  dark  shaded  cell, every member of  the community is included in the

of  all the members of  the community is obtained through active intervention
or coercion from the state or from the institution responsible for the project
implementation.  In  particular,  a  social  exclusion-aware  project  design  may
succeed in achieving total participation if  it has devised instruments to avoid
social exclusion pushes.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

The Senegalese story: how to move from social exclusion to optimal participation. Concerning the
political  variable: As discussed earlier, it was clear that the village community
was  divided  along  political  lines  between  the  two  most  inﬂuential  political
parties, the PDS (Parti Démocratique Sénégalais, in power) and the opposi-
tion  party  PS  (Parti  Socialiste).  As  a  result,  project  implementation  proved
difﬁcult  in  a  context  of  shifting  political  support  to  and  hijacking  of  the
project. At ﬁrst, the project was allegedly hijacked by the PS: most members
of  the steering committee were active PS members, and the president of  the
steering committee was the highly controversial ex-mayor of  the municipality
(Président  de  la  Communauté  Rurale).  This  triggered  the  self-exclusion  of
many potentially interested community members who did not want to par-
ticipate in what they called a “PS project”.

Once  the  political  situation  was  identiﬁed  as  a  major  exclusion  factor,  a
sensitization campaign was launched by ENDA Graf  Sahel to “depoliticize”
the  project  and  to  promote  the  inclusion  of  PDS  members,  and  apolitical
citizens. This was crucial to restore trust in the project at the community
and individual levels. As a matter of  fact, the new steering committee now
exhibits  a  large  panel  of  political  afﬁliations  and  many  non-politically
marked members.

Concerning the religious variable: Although Senegal is an example of  religious
tolerance  and  of  smooth  cohabitation  between  Islam  (
 
 
 
 
 
per  cent  of  the
 
population) and Catholicism ( per cent), the village has the speciﬁc charac-
teristic  of  hosting  a  monastery  and  consequently  a  rather  large  Catholic
community compared with national proportions. This feature had an impact
on the acceptance of  the project and on the inclusion or exclusion of  certain
people.  The  inﬂuence  of  the  local  religious  leaders  in  particular  can  be
traced in the participatory pattern exhibited by the Christian community. At
ﬁrst, not a single Christian took part in the project and there was an obvious
uninterest in the project from Christian leaders.

The active intervention of  ENDA Graf  Sahel was needed to improve the
communication  of  the  project  to  Christian  leaders.  Once  their  trust  was
gained  through  a  targeted  campaign  about  the  project’s  beneﬁts,  many
Christians  got  involved  and  took  responsibilities  in  the  management  struc-
tures of  the savings bank.

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Concerning the social variable: In addition to political and religious identities,
a number of  inﬂuential people emerged from the rest of  the villagers through
their social position within the community. The most prominent characters
of  the  community  represented  vested  interests  groups,  in  particular  local
entrepreneurs and presidents of  cooperatives or community-based organiza-

local entrepreneur, was very active in the management and communication
of  the  project  to  the  rest  of  the  community,  and  especially  his  employees.

This  shows  that  economically  and  socially  inﬂuential  individuals  are  more
likely to have the experience or conﬁdence to see themselves in the partici-
patory role and to capture participatory channels (Plummer ).

It is interesting to note here that social capital can overcome other tradi-
tionally  excluding  features  such  as  age,  gender  or  education.  Indeed,  the
president  of  the  women  processing  unit,  an  illiterate  old  woman,  held  the
position  of  treasury  ofﬁcer  in  the  steering  committee,  and  still  holds  an
important  position  in  the  new  management  structure.  Moreover,  the  few
isolated  or  outcast  people  who  did  take  part  in  the  project  relied  on  other
assets  such  as  their  connections  with  the  NGO  staff  members  to  ﬁnd  the
necessary psychological support to participate in the project. The poorest of
the poor—isolated, old and disabled people—were, as is very often the case,
not included in the project.

Concerning the “environmental” context: The NGO itself  can have an exclusion-
ary  impact  through  its  inﬂuence  on  decision-making  and  on  the  choice  of
the  members  of  the  management  structures.  NGOs  are  not  without  their
own agenda and they must acknowledge their exclusionary as well as inclu-
sionary  potentials.  The  natural  authority  granted  to  NGO  staff  members
may  be  a  barrier  to  equitable  participation  unless  the  organization  is  itself
trained  to  avoid  such  pitfalls.  It  seems  that  the  philosophy  of  ENDA  Graf
Sahel did minimize such risks in the project studied.

The evidence from the project in Senegal shows that the NGO and its staff
members can enhance participation. Some isolated people living in remote
villages or traditionally outcast people such as the Peul were included in the
project thanks to the NGO staff  members who disseminated the information
to them and morally and psychologically encouraged their participation.

project  was  revised  to  minimize  some  exclusionary  pushes  that  were  easily
 
 
 
 
identiﬁable.  However,  the  project  team  probably  did  not  perceive  all  the
potential exclusionary factors which could have been acted upon to increase
participation.  In  some  cases,  a  project  team  does  not  have  the  scope  to
remove all the barriers to participation, especially when these are structural
or institutional. The action of  the government is then needed to contribute
to an active ﬁght against social exclusion at the community level.

In ﬁgure 

can locate these patterns of  persistent social exclusion in 

the
light shaded cell: no one participates in the project even though it is perceived
as good and answering a felt need of  the community. The reasons for such
a pattern can range from bad dissemination of  information, to a lack of  the
necessary physical or human capital to implement the project. In this case there
is  a  very  minimal  and  equal  beneﬁt  to  all  ( ):  the  hope  generated  by  the
interest of  foreigners in the community, expectations for future realization or
even a nascent mobilization of  the community. Minimal gains are also made
from not engaging in a time-consuming project with unpredictable results.

This was typically the case of  the president of  the association of  taxi drivers.
Conversely, many people in the community lacked the basic conﬁdence and self-
esteem to consider themselves “worthy” or capable of  taking part in the project.
Of  course, the psychological features of  individuals are highly dependent
on  economic  or  social  assets.  Strengthening  people’s  self-esteem  requires
long-term processes and actions at the societal level, such as education and
poverty eradication, discussed below.

Promoting  basic  education:  Even  after  some  adjustment  measures,  especially
after a sensitization campaign to depoliticize the project, some exclusionary
variables  remained  present  in  the  community.  A  feature  of  the  community
which  impacted  upon  the  participation  of  villagers  was  the  generally  low
educational  level  and  thereby  the  low  management,  organizational  and
leadership skills available in the community to take part in the project at a
decisional level. Education is a key factor of  inclusion although it can some-
times be overcome by other assets such as social capital.

The lengthy search for an appropriately educated bank clerk highlighted
the  difﬁculty  in  implementing  projects  with  mostly  illiterate  people.  The
appointed bank clerk, although one of  the most educated women available
in  the  village,  found  it  quite  challenging  to  deal  with  some  of  the  tasks
associated with the smooth running of  the savings bank. At the heart of  the
problem was not so much the generally low literacy levels, but the unavailability
of  the few educated members of  the community. A young, highly educated
architect was very interested in the project, but proved to be highly unreliable
as he himself  had other business commitments.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Fighting against chronic poverty: The crucial and crosscutting issue of  material
poverty  did  determine  the  extent  to  which  people  were  able  or  willing  to
participate, or were excluded from participation because of  economic reasons.
As  a  whole,  participants  in  the  project  were  sufﬁciently  endowed  to  afford
sparing some time for the project. On the other hand, the economic gains
to be made from the project were probably not high enough to attract some
qualiﬁed people, such as the young architect.

The general level of  participation and its quality was heavily inﬂuenced by
the economic situation of the community: poor infrastructures, little available
resources at the municipality level, and not being able to afford basic neces-
sities for the smooth running of  the project certainly hampered the progress
of  the project. In particular, lack of  access to transportation (in terms of  cost
and not actual availability) did deter the participation of  isolated villagers.
 r ecapitulates the above discussion through an identiﬁcation of  the
excluded and included groups or individuals in the context of  the community
project  in  Senegal.  The  social  exclusion  variables  determine  the  ability
and  willingness  of  individuals  or  subgroups  within  the  community  to  par-
ticipate in the project as well as the extent and quality of  participation. The
variables  help  to  locate  policy  intervention  or  project  activities  that  have
been or could have been implemented to enhance participation in the com-
munity.  Ultimately,  the  aim  is  to  move  on  the  participatory  matrix  from  a

On our understanding of  participation in community development projects . . .
This article has uncovered some of  the complex mechanisms at play within
communities that shape the extent to which participation is genuinely achieved.
The example from Senegal shows that the combined use of  game theory and
the  concept  of  social  exclusion  can  enlighten  the  analysis  of  participatory
 
 
 
 
 
processes as it articulates all the different patterns of  
or inclusion
possible and makes for a contextual interpretation of  these patterns.

 
 
 
 
 
clusion 

First, game theory shows that in the case of  a “good” project, gains are
made by being included. Conversely, in the case of  a “bad” project, gains are
made by being excluded (gain  ). These are fairly expected results. However,
game  theory  also  shows  that  opposing/conﬂicting  behaviours 
( being
included  while  excluding  others  and  vice  versa)  are  more  beneﬁcial  to  one
party  in  each  scenario  (gain 
)  since  comparative  advantage  derives  from
the unequal situation. There are therefore rational push factors that encourage
exclusionary processes.

Secondly,  through  its  comprehensive  illustration  of  all  the  possible  par-
ticipatory patterns, game theory helps to locate individuals or groups in the
participatory matrix. The combination of  game theory with the concept of
social  exclusion  gives  scope  for  a  contextual  interpretation  of  participation
and social exclusion alongside a wide range of  possible variables. Among others,
the analysis acknowledges the possibility of  people excluding themselves from
participation through a conscious calculus. This possibility is often neglected
in  traditional  analyses  of  participation  which  emphasize the  integration
of all as an ultimate goal. The framework here captures the diversity of options
in participatory processes. This is in line with a diversity and people-centred
approach to development and community participation.

The  fact  that  rational  livelihood  strategies  may  result  in  voluntary  social
exclusion should not distract attention from the exclusionary processes that
hamper participation on inequitable grounds. Blatant gender or ethnic dis-
criminations  are  obvious  examples  of  processes  that  need  to  be  checked
through  active  policy  intervention.  Institutional  processes,  internal  politics,
access to infrastructures and other dimensions that seem to be more remote
to  participatory  processes  also  need  to  be  investigated  and  acted  upon  to
achieve genuine, equitable and free participation. In this context, Sen’s cap-
ability approach (Sen and Nussbaum 
) is useful in making the distinction
between  giving  people  the  opportunity  to  participate  and  yet  not  coercing
participation. Enhancing capabilities to promote individual agency should be
the  focus  of  community  development  projects  and  the  strategy  to  promote
genuine, people-centred participation.

On social policy-making and practice . . .

For  that  purpose,  analysing  the  “subjective”  and  contextual  factors  of  par-
ticipation is the key to ﬁnding leverage points to minimize exclusionary pushes.

In this sense, it is essential to contextualize game theory through social exclu-
sion  and  livelihood  characteristics.  Devising  an  appropriate  ﬁlter  of  social
exclusion  that  integrates  as  many  variables  as  possible  can  help  to  locate
policy  interventions  or  project  activities  that  will  enhance  inclusion  rather
than  exclusion.  Indeed,  the  rational  push  and  pull  factors  of  participation
unravelled by game theory can be either mitigated or reinforced by cultural
norms and social capital, social or economic considerations, political pressure,
etc., and it is the task of  social planners to “play” with all these variables to
increase community participation.

Such a tool of  analysis is attractive for social planners who wish to optimize
participation  as  a  development  tool,  while  being  aware  of  its  limitations.
Since  social  exclusion  emphasizes  the  multiplicity  of  agents  and  processes
leading  to  exclusion,  it  allows  a  much  more  precise  understanding  of  par-
ticipatory processes and of  the “culprits” of  social exclusion in community
development  projects.  While  traditional  analyses  may  blame  the  poor  for
their apathy and consequent non-participation, the concept of  social exclu-
sion offers a much wider range of  possible structural, institutional, cultural,
economic and other barriers to participation. In turn, this leads to a much
broader  set  of  policies  available  to  counteract  or  at  least  attenuate  the
dynamics of  social exclusion. “Our chances of  developing effective policies will
be greater if  we can improve our understanding of  such processes” ( Hills et al.
). The framework presented in this article provides a checklist by which
constraints  on  participation  can  be  prioritized  for  action  to  remove  them,
and the links between them identiﬁed.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Notwithstanding  this,  the  number  of  explanatory  variables  included
in the social exclusion ﬁlter and in the example from Senegal appears to be
large.  This  is  an  inherent  difﬁculty  with  the  use  of  an  all-encompassing
concept  such  as  social  exclusion  that  is  ﬂexible  enough  to  capture  multiple
variables of  varying signiﬁcance. Thus, the next step should be to identify
the  variables  that  make  a  signiﬁcant  impact  on  participation,  and  to  order
them according to their weight in explaining speciﬁc participatory patterns.
This would allow measuring the degree of  “exclusionary power” of  the dif-
ferent  variables  and  to  prioritize  project  activities  or  policy  interventions
accordingly. Social planners must try and identify the key barriers to partic-
ipation without ﬂooding the debate with exhaustive lists of  potential exclu-
sionary factors.

The partial success of  the project in Senegal lies in the careful monitoring
of  some  social  exclusion  variables  in  the  second  phase  of  the  project.  A
better—and  earlier—insight  into  the  mechanisms  at  play  behind  participa-
tion and the different exclusionary pushes could have contributed to enhance
participation  even  further  or  to  anticipate  social  exclusion  processes.  What
the present study proposes is a simple tool to map exclusionary processes
and  to  ﬁnd  possible  leverage  points  to  minimize  them.  Above  anything
else,  it  is  about  shaping  a  mindset  which  is  characterized  by  a  clear
awareness  and  understanding  of  the  ambiguities  and  barriers  to  genuine

Note
. A livelihood “comprises the capabilities, assets (including both material and social
resources) and activities required for a means of  living. A livelihood is sustainable
when  it  can  cope  with  and  recover  from  stresses  and  shocks,  and  maintain  or
enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future, while not under-
mining the natural resource base” (Farrington et al. 

).
