ABSTRACT 
 
A field experiment was carried out during the rainy cropping seasons of 2010 and 2011 in Southeastern 
Senegal. The study aimed at investigating the effects of sowing dates on plant growth and grain yield of fonio 
millet (Digitaria exilis Stapf). Seven planting times (from early July to mid August with 7-day interval) were 
laid out in a randomized complete block design. In general, plant growth and grain yield were significantly 
better for the early July sowing dates compared to other sowing dates. However, tillering capacity and grain 
size were not influenced by the sowing date. Highest grain yields were obtained on 15-July planting date with 
an average of 1,111 kg ha-1 in 2010 and 1,269 kg ha-1 in 2011. Compared to this planting date, the delay in 
sowing  reduced  grain  yield  by  50%  in  2010  and  87%  in  2011.  Detrimental  high  rains  to  seedling  vigor, 
decreasing sunshine during the plant growth, and rain deficit during the reproductive phase were among the 
main limiting factors for late sowings. Hence, the first fortnight of July could be recommended as optimal 
sowing period for early maturing cultivars of fonio in Southeastern Senegal.

INTRODUCTION 
Fonio millet (Digitaria exilis Stapf) is a 
cereal crop mainly grown in the southern and 
southeastern provinces of Senegal (Lo, 2003; 
USAID, 2008; Cruz et al., 2011). It plays an 
important role as a complementary staple food 
in  rural  areas  (Diedhiou,  2008;  Vall  et  al., 
2011).  In  addition,  more  recently,  fonio  by-

products,  like  husked  grains  and  parboiled 
grains, are being used for income generation 
for small scale farmers and women groups in 
these  areas  of  the  country.  Unfortunately, 
grain  yields  are  low  with  an  average  of  less 
than  600  kg  ha-1  (Diedhiou,  2008;  ANSD, 
2010)  and  generally 
in 
marketing  the  production  surplus  (USAID,

the 

 
2008;  Niang-Seydi,  2010).  Recent 
field 
surveys revealed that  farmers prefer planting 
the  early  or 
intermediate  maturing 
landraces  instead  of  the  late  maturing  ones 
(Diedhiou,  2008;  Kanfany,  2008).  The  early 
cultivars  help  farmers  to  match  the  crop 
growth and development cycle to the duration 
of actual rainy season (Azam-Ali and Squire, 
2002).  With  climatic  changes,  the  Southern 
and  Southeastern  provinces  of  Senegal  have 
experienced 
frequent  erratic  and  scarce 
rainfalls, even though they remain the wettest 
areas  of  the  country.  Under  such  climate 
conditions, decision making on whether or not 
to sow become a real concern to farmers who 
must  cope  with  a  heavy  workload  over  the 
crop calendar.  
In addition, knowledge on the optimal 
time of sowing is lacking nationwide (USAID, 
2008;  Fall  and  Lo,  2009)  and  little  research 
undertaken in other fonio producing countries 
mainly  focused  on  germoplasm  collections 
and  characterizations,  and  post  harvest 
technologies  improvement  (Vodouhe  et  al., 
2003;  Vodouhe  et  al.,  2005;  Vodouhe  and 
Achigan  Dako,  2006).  The  objective  of  this 
study was to investigate the effects of sowing 
dates on fonio plant growth and grain yield in 
Southeastern Senegal.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Experimental sites 
Field trials were carried out at two sites 
in  Southeastern  Senegal  during  the  rainy 
seasons  of  2010  and  2011.  The  sites  were 
Bandafassi (12°32' N, 12°18' W, 215 m above 
sea  level)  and  Sinthiou  Maleme  (13°49'  N, 
13°55' W, 6 m above sea level). Bandafassi is 
located  in  Kedougou  province  and  Sinthiou 
Maleme is located in Tambacounda province 
(Figure  1).  In  this  part  of  the  country,  the 
rainy  season  starts  between  mid  May  and 
June,  and  ends  in  October,  with  a  unimodal 
pattern  where  August and September are the 
rainiest months. The trends of the main agro-
meteorological  parameters  are  shown 
in 
Figures 2 and 3. The long-term rainfall (1971-
2000)  averages  are  1085  mm  at  Bandafassi 
and  677  mm  at  Sinthiou  Maleme.  For  both 
 

sites,  air  temperature  is  lower  whereas  air 
humidity  is  higher  during  the  rainy  season. 
Soil analyses show that the soils of both sites 
were acidic with low organic matter and low 
cation exchange capacity (Table 1). The soil 
in Bandafassi was sandy to clayey with small 
gravels in the topsoil layer and it was sandy to 
loamy in Sinthiou Maleme.  

 
Experimental design 
Seven (7) sowing dates  were assigned 
in a randomized complete block design, with 
in  2010  and  2011, 
4  and  5  replicates 
respectively. The first sowing dates started on 
July 1st in 2010 and on July 8th in 2011 and the 
following  sowing  dates  were  at  a  7-day 
interval (Table 2).  

 
Crop management 
The experiment was carried out during 
the rainy season, from July to October in both 
years.  Prior  to  sowing,  plots  were  ploughed, 
manually  weeded,  and  fertilized  with  NPK 
complex (15% N, 15% P2O5 and 15% K2O) at 
a  rate  of  100  kg ha-1.  Seeds  of  the  early 
maturing landrace of fonio known as ‘Momo’ 
(Diedhiou,  2008;  Kanfany,  2008)  were 
broadcasted in each plot at a rate of 30 kg ha-1 
as  recommended  by  Kanfany  and  Gueye 
(2011). The weeding and insecticidal spraying 
against sucking insects and leaf  worms  were 
done  when  needed  during  each  growing 
season.  The  plots  were  protected  against 
domestic animals and birds from grain setting 
to harvest period. In 2010, all the plots were 
normally  harvested  but  in  2011  the  first 
sowing  date  began  on  July  8th,  due  to  late 
onset of rainy season and dry  spell;  whereas 
the last two sowing dates were not harvested, 
due to poor plant growth and drought during 
grain filling. For each year, harvest time was 
done in agreement with the findings of Bakare 
(2005).

At maturity, plant stems were cut using 
sickles at the closest ground possible and sun-
dried  for  30  days  prior  to  weighing.  Plant 
aerial  biomass  weight  and  grain  yield  were 
recorded  for  each  plot  in  both  years.  Three 
1000-grain samples were weighed by using a 
precision balance.  

 
Statistical analyses 
All  data  were  subject  to  analyses  of 
variance  (ANOVA),  except  the  phenological 
parameters. Mean separations were performed 
using Least Significant Difference Test if the 
F-test for treatment effects were significant (P 
≤  0.05)  according  to  Gomez  and  Gomez 
(1984).  These 
statistical  analyses  were 
performed using GenStat Discovery Edition 4 
(VSN International Ltd, United Kingdom).

de  Bambey 
Recherches  Agronomiques 
(CNRA).  The  daily  rainfall  was  recorded  by 
means  of 
to 
experimental sites.  
The  plant  growth  parameters  (plant 
population, plant height, and number of tillers 
per  plant)  were  assessed  in  both  years.  The 
phenology data (date to 50% heading, date to 
50%  flowering,  and  date 
to  50%  grain 
maturity)  were  only  evaluated  in  2010.  The 
plant  population  was  estimated  in  3  small 
squares measuring 0.5 m by 0.5 m randomly 
taken and delimited in each plot. Plant height 
and number of tillers per plant were recorded 
on ten randomly selected plants per plot. The 
phenology  data  was  only  assessed  in  one 
replicate due to its high demand in time and 
labor for the recording.

RESULTS 
Seasonal conditions 

generally  resulted  in  better  plant  growth 
characteristics  (Figures  4  and  5).  In  2011, 
plant  population  averaged  1029,  661,  530, 
275,  and  551  plants m-²  for  respectively,  the 
following sowing dates: July 8th, 15th, 22nd and 
29th, and August 5th. Days to heading, days to 
flowering  and  plant  maturity  were  slightly 
shortened  with  late  plantings  in  2010  (Data 
were  not  recorded  in  2011).  At  maturity,  as 
shown  in  Figure  5,  the  tallest  plants  were 
observed  with  sowing  dates  up  to  July  22nd 
whereas  the  shortest  plants  were  observed 
when sowing dates placed at the end of July 
and  in  August  (P  <  0.001).  The  number  of 
tillers per plant ranged from 2.6 to 4.4 in 2010 
and  from  3.7  to  4.5  in  2011  (Figure  5);  but 
this  number  of  tillers  was  not  statistically 
influenced  by  the  delayed  sowing  in  both 
years. 

Aerial biomass and grain production 

Table  4  shows 

that  sowing  date 
significantly affected plant aerial biomass (P < 
0.05 in 2010 and P < 0.01 in 2011) and grain 
yield (P < 0.001 for both years). Highest aerial 
biomass  and  grain  yield  were  obtained  with 
the July 15th sowing date. Sowing before and 
after  this  date  led  to  a  reduction  in  biomass 
and  grain  yield.  Sowing  after  July  15th 
reduced  aerial  biomass  and  grain  yield  by 
23% and 50% in 2010, respectively, whereas 
these  reductions  were  respectively  54%  and 
87% in 2011. The 1000-grain  weight ranged 
between  0.63  and  0.66  g  in  2010  and  from 
0.50 to 0.60 g in 2011 (Table 4). Grain size 
was higher in 2010 compared to 2011, but was 
not  affected  by  late  planting  dates  for  both 
years. 
 

 

Air 

temperature  and  sunshine  are 
shown  in Figure 2 for years  2010 and 2011. 
During the rainy season of 2010, from May to 
October,  the  monthly  minimum  temperature 
ranged  between  21.5  and  27.1  °C  and  the 
maximum  between  31.0  and  39.4  °C.  The 
minimum  temperature  ranged  between  21.8 
and 26.1 °C and the maximum between 32.4 
and  41.0  °C,  during  the  2011  rainy  season. 
The  monthly  duration  of 
the  sunshine 
averaged between 5.3 and 7.2 hours per day 
for  2010  and  between  6.0  and  8.9  hours  per 
day for 2011. 

Higher air humidity was observed from 
May to October (Figure 3). Its minimum and 
maximum values ranged 38-66% and 91-98% 
in 2010, respectively; whereas they ranged 23-
64% and 56-95% in 2011, respectively.  

The  rainfall  for  2010  and  2011  were 
1321 mm for 89 rainy days, and 784 mm in 45 
rainy  days,  respectively.  Both  years  were 
considered 
to  have  normal  rainy  season 
compared to the long-term rainfall from 1971 
to 2000 at all sites (Figure 3). However, the 
rainy  season  globally  was  wetter  and  well-
distributed  in  2010  while  the  effective  rain 
started  later  and  ceased  earlier  in  2011.  The 
early  planting  dates  received  more  rain 
compared  to  the  late  plantings  that  had  less 
rainfall during the entire growing season, but 
more heavy rains during their growth stage for 
each sowing date (Table 3). 

Characteristics of plant growth  

For  both  years, 

the  planting  date 
influenced  fonio  millet  plant  population,  its 
vigor and phenology. The early sowing dates

DISCUSSION 
During the rainy seasons of year 2010 
and  2011,  weather  conditions  were  normal 
compared  to  the  long-term  rainfall  (1971-
2000).  However,  the  rain  distribution  was 
better in 2010 than in 2011. Previous reviews 
pointed  out  that  fonio  is  grown  in  tropical 
areas  with  low,  average  or  high  rainfalls, 
either in upland or high lands (Vodouhe and 
Achigan Dako, 2006). In addition, Cruz et al. 
(2011) reported that fonio is a plant with wide 
adaptation range and minor effects of climatic 
or  soil  conditions.  However,  poor  plant 
density  and  slow  plant  growth  observed  in 
late-planted plots are strongly related to high 
level of rains during post-emergence and the 
growth  stage.  Malik  and  Yadav  (2014) 
reported  that  better  plant  vigor  was  obtained 
with  early  sowing.  In  the  case  of  our  study, 
the number of days having received more than 
10  mm  of  rain  (RD  ≥  10  mm)  was  as 
important  in  later  plantings  as  in  earlier 
sowings.  Negative  effects  of  high  rains  on 
seed emergence and seedling vigor have been 
observed in buffalograss (Frank et al., 1998).  
Plant  height  was  shorter  with  late 
plantings  in  comparison  with  early  ones. 
Juraimi  et  al.  (2009)  reported  similar  effects 
with tef grass (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) 
grown  in  Ethiopia.  Strong  reduction  in  plant 
height  had  been  previously  shown  when 
sowings were delayed on cereal crops (Azam-
Ali  and  Squire,  2002).  Similar  findings  also 
have been recently reported in other cultivated 
crops (Malik and Yadav, 2014; Meena et al., 
2015).  
Decreases  in  sunshine  due  to  clouds 
were more important during the rainy season, 
particularly  for late plantings. This reduction 
of  sunshine  could  explain  the  shortening  of 
heading, flowering, and maturing times. These 
findings  are 
those 
observed  with  most  of  local  tropical  cereal 
crops  grown  under  short  day  length  (Azam-
Ali  and  Squire,  2002). This  reduction  of  the 
length of phenological stages suggests that the 
this 
landrace  used 
short 
photoperiod-sensitive (Aliero and Morakinyo, 
2005; Cruz et al., 2011).  
 

in  accordance  with 

in 

In  this  study,  total  tillering  was  not 
significantly  affected  by  the  planting  date 
which  is  in  agreement  with  the  findings  of 
Abou Khalifa (2009) with rice. However, this 
study  revealed  that  sowing  date  reduced 
significantly the number of productive tillers.  
Early  sowing  resulted  in  better  plant 
growth  and  higher  grain  yield  compared  to 
late sowing. This result is in agreement with 
that  of  warm  cereal  crops,  e.g.  corn  and 
sorghum  in  sub  Saharan  Africa  (Azam-Ali 
and  Squire,  2002).  In  addition,  planting 
around  July  15th  led  to  the  highest  aerial 
biomass and grain yield for both years. Before 
and particularly after this planting date, plant 
population,  plant  height,  aerial  biomass  and 
grain  yield  are  drastically  reduced.  Similar 
relationships  between  sowing  date  and  crop 
responses  have  been  previously  reported  on 
many  cereal  crops  under  various  conditions 
(Dokuyucu et al., 2004; Kamara et al., 2009; 
Aslani  and  Mehrvar,  2012).  These  studies 
showed that delaying planting shortens time to 
heading or time to flowering and that leads to 
the reduction of resource capture. This canopy 
reduction  exposes  late  planted  crop  to  long 
dry  spells  or  severe  drought  during  the 
reproductive  stage  and  affects  grain  setting 
and filling. Grain size reduction or immature 
grains increased with late planted cereal crops 
when  drought  or  high  temperature  occurred 
during  grain  filling  (Dokuyucu  et  al.,  2004; 
Yang and Zhang, 2006; Aslani and Mehrvar, 
2012).  
 
Conclusion 
This experiment aimed at investigating 
the effects of different planting dates on plant 
growth  and  grain  yield  of  early  maturing 
landrace of fonio millet. Earlier sowing dates 
gave  highest  plant,  maximum  aerial  biomass 
and  highest  grain  yield.  In  general,  plant 
growth and grain production were drastically 
reduced when planting after the 15th of July or 
in August. These reductions were due to high 
rainfall,  the  shortening  of  day  length,  and 
water  deficit  during  the  reproductive  phase, 
mainly during grain filling period. For a better 
development of plants and a high grain yield,
