Feeding   the  future   world   population   requires   increased   crop   production.   Here,   we   investigate   the   inten-
siﬁcation  option   of  increasing   production   by   increasing   cropping   intensity   and   choice   of  varieties   with
different   crop   duration.   We   developed   a  model   to   generate,   compare   and   visualise   opportunities   for   sin-
gle/double/triple   cropping   systems   consisting   of  irrigated   rice   and   optionally   a   vegetable.   The   model   was
applied  in   a  case   study   in   the   Senegal   River   valley.   Results   showed   that  with   appropriate   choice   of   sowing
dates,   severe   cold   sterility   in   rice   can   be   avoided,   also  in   rice–rice   crop   rotations.   At   optimal   sowing   dates,
simulated   total   long   term   average   potential   yields   of   single,   double   and   triple   cropping   yields   were   10.3,
19.0   and   18.9   t/ha   respectively   (total   of   1,2   and   3  yields).   With   a   hypothetical   completely   cold   tolerant
variety,   yields   could   increase   to  11.2,   20.2   and   20.9   respectively.   Simulated   Triple   crop   yields   are   hardly
any   higher   than   those   of   a   double   crop   with   two   medium   duration   varieties.   Delay   in   sowing   due   to  late
availability   of   resources   (machinery,   irrigation   water   allocation   within   a  scheme,   credits   for   pump   fuel)
is  a  known   problem   in   the   region.   Therefore   we   also   simulated   how   much   delay   was  possible   (width   of
the   sowing   windows)   whilst   still   allowing   for   double   cropping.   We   found   enough   delay   was   possible   to
allow   for   a  rice–rice   or   a  rice-vegetable   crop.   A  rice-rice-vegetable   triple   cropping   system   would   only   be
possible   without   delays   and   with   a  very   short   duration   vegetable   of  2  months.   Most   promising   options
to   increase   production   are  through   shifting   the   sowing   date   to   facilitate   double   cropping,   adoption   of
medium   duration   varieties   and   breeding   for   cold   tolerant   varieties.

1.  Introduction

Global  demand  for  agricultural  crop  production  is  expected  to
roughly  double  by  2050  (Kastner  et  al.,  2012).  The  challenge  of
meeting  demands  of  a  growing  population  can  be  met   by  increas-
ing  yields  on  existing  land,  bringing  new  land  into  cultivation  or
imports  from  other  parts  of  the  world  (Van  Oort  et  al.,  2015b).  The
options  for  bringing  new  land  into  cultivation  may   be  limited,  as
often  the  suitable  lands  are  already  in  use  (Hall  and  Richards,  2013;

Young,  1999).  Reliance  on  imports  can  be  a  solution  only  when
pressure  on  land  and  water  is  less  in  exporting  countries.  Although
the  relation  between  high  import  dependency  and  poverty,  price
ﬂuctuations  and  food  riots  or  political  instability  is  complex  and
dependent  on  many  factors  (Natalini  et  al.,  2015),  a  number  of  stud-
ies  suggest  that  such  relations  do  exist  (Sternberg,  2012;  Weinberg
and  Bakker,  2015;  Wischnath  and  Buhaug,  2014).  To  increase  pro-
duction,  most  researchers  advocate  increasing  yields  on  existing
land,  referred  to  as  intensiﬁcation.  The  two   main  intensiﬁcation
options  are:  (1)  closing  the  yield  gap  and  (2)  increasing  the  number
of  days  in  the  year  in  which  the  land  is  used  for  crop  cultivation
(Cassman  et  al.,  2003;  Foley  et  al.,  2011;  Garnett  et  al.,  2013;  Pretty
et  al.,  2011;  Ramankutty  and  Rhemtulla,  2012;  van  Ittersum  et  al.,
2013).  Breeding  can  contribute  to  this  through  the  development

of  high  yielding  and  stress  tolerant  varieties  (Evenson  and  Gollin,
2003)  and  varieties  with  “optimal”  phenology.

In  irrigated  areas  an  important  question  for  breeders  is  whether
they  should  select  for  shorter  duration  varieties  which  would
enable  growing  two  or  even  three  crops  per  year,  or  alternatively
breed  for  medium/long  duration  varieties  that  yield  more  per  indi-
vidual  crop  but  possibly  restrict  options  for  growing  two  or  three
crops  per  year.  The  same  question  is  relevant  for  farmers,  who
decide  on  what  varieties  to  include  in  their  crop  rotations.  The
answer  to  this  question  on  short  versus  medium  duration  varieties
depends  on  how  many  days  exist  within  the  year  with  a  favourable
climate.  At  high  latitude  locations  only  one  crop  may   be  possible
per  year  because  of  low  temperatures  and  low  radiation  levels  in
the  colder  half  of  the  year.  There,  extending  the  length  of  the  grow-
ing  season  of  a  single  crop  may   have  more  prospects.  Or,  when  a
yield  plateau  is  reached  at  a  certain  crop  duration,  an  intensiﬁcation
option  is  growing  a  vegetable  crop  or  cover  crop  in  autumn,  after
harvesting  a  winter  cereal  in  summer.  Moving  closer  to  the  equator
the  number  of  favourable  days  increases  and  so  the  choice  between
single/double/triple  cereal  cropping  becomes  more  pertinent;  all
three  should  be  considered.  Clearly,  when  researching  options  for
intensiﬁcation  we  should  take  into  consideration  the  climate.  We
should  not  only  look  at  intensiﬁcation  options  for  individual  crops
but  also  implications  for  the  viability  of  crop  rotations.

Ideotyping  has  in  the  past  (Dingkuhn  et  al.,  1991)  and  more
recently  again  (Rötter  et  al.,  2015)  been  proposed  as  a  method  in
which  crop  growth  models  can  be  used  to  identify  the  optimal  com-
bination  of  morphological  and/or  physiological  traits  in  a  crop,  for
optimizing  performance  in  a  particular  biophysical  environment
and  crop  management  package.  Ideotyping  to  date  has  remained
very  much  focussed  on  individual  crops.  There  have  been  no  ideo-
typing  studies  in  which  trait  optimisation  has  been  conducted  in
the  crop  rotation  context.  A  few  models  have  been  proposed  for
comparing  crop  rotations  (Dogliotti  et  al.,  2003;  Huong  et  al.,  2014)
but  with  these  it  is  difﬁcult  to  simulate  in  detail  climatic  risks  and
effects  of  varietal  differences.  With  other  models  such  as  APSIM  and
DSSAT  crop  rotations  can  be  simulated  and  climatic  risks  quanti-
ﬁed  (Jones  et  al.,  2003;  Keating  et  al.,  2003)  (Holzworth  et  al.,  2014;
Jones  et  al.,  2003),  but  these  models  do  not  allow  for  easily  generat-
ing  and  comparing  very  large  numbers  of  cropping  calendar  options
and  varietal  traits.  What  is  missing  is  a  model  that  allows  for  gen-
×
erating  and  comparing  large  numbers  of  crop  rotation 
  ideotype
options  whilst  at  the  same  time  also  simulating  climatic  risks  of
crops  in  these  rotations.

In  this  study,  we  analyse  the  scope  for  intensiﬁcation  at  a  site  in
Senegal,  near  the  town  of  Fanaye,  representing  the  middle  valley
of  the  Senegal  River  in  the  Sahel.  The  study  area  has  three  seasons:
a  cold  dry  season  (Nov.–Feb.),  a  hot  dry  season  (Mar.–Jun.)  and  a
warm  wet  season  (Jul.–Oct).  The  area  is  sparsely  populated  and
ample  irrigation  water  is  available.  Important  crops  are  rice,  tomato
and  onion.  These  crops  are  grown  for  home  consumption  and  for
the  market.  Scope  for  rice  intensiﬁcation  in  this  study  area  has  been
extensively  studied  in  the  1990s  as  reported  in  the  book  by  (Miezan
et  al.,  1997).  Reﬂecting  on  the  various  contributions  to  this  book,
(Matlon,  1997),  noted  a  number  of  knowledge  gaps  including  the
need  to  look  more  broadly  for  other  options  and  not  only  at  rice–rice
double  cropping.  The  second  gap  in  the  research  reported  in  the
book  by  (Miezan  et  al.,  1997)  as  noted  by  Matlon  (1997)  was   the
lack  of  adequate  consideration  of  the  farmers’  perspective.

Since  these  critical  comments  by  (Matlon,  1997),  there  have
been  more  studies  on  the  farmers’  perspective.  Causes  of  yield  gaps
were  identiﬁed  as  poor  supply  of  labour,  unavailability  of  machin-
ery,  lack  of  credits  to  purchase  inputs  (fertiliser,  herbicides,  certiﬁed
seeds),  inappropriate  timing  of  fertiliser  application  and  poor  tim-
ing  of  allocation  of  irrigation  water  within  the  irrigation  scheme
as  important  constraints  (Haefele  et  al.,  2002;  Krupnik  et  al.,  2012;

Tanaka  et  al.,  2015).  The  original  analysis  of  scope  for  rice–rice  dou-
ble  cropping  by  Dingkuhn  (1995)  was   later  followed  up  by  (Poussin
et  al.,  2006,  2005)  who  considered  labour  organisation  of  differ-
ent  operations  in  rice  cropping  within  an  irrigation  scheme.  Three
challenges  that  have  not  been  taken  up  are  (1)  broader  systematic
exploration  of  options  for  intensiﬁcation  including  vegetables,  (2)
link  to  ideotyping  where  not  only  sowing  dates  of  the  2–3  crops  in
the  rotation  are  varied,  but  also  crop  traits  such  as  crop  duration  and
tolerance  to  cold-induced  sterility  and  (3)  analysis  of  ﬂexibility:  is
double  or  triple  cropping  also  possible  if  sowing  of  crops  is  delayed,
for  instance  due  to  lack  of  machinery,  seeds  or  water  allocation?  If
so,  how  much  delay  is  possible?

The  only  previous  study  which  did  look  in  a  systematic  manner
into  options  for  intensiﬁcation  was   by  Dingkuhn  (1995).  Dingkuhn
compared  single  and  double  rice  cropping  options.  Speciﬁcally  for
our  study  area,  he  concluded  that  double  cropping  is  “possible  but
subject  to  severe  time  constraints”.  These  time  constraints  were
caused  by  the  difﬁculty  of  ﬁtting  two   crops  in  one  year,  a  required
period  between  the  two   crops  and  the  need  to  avoid  periods  with
heat  and  cold  sterility.  It  is  interesting  therefore  in  such  a  site  to
investigate  if  twenty  years  later  the  situation  has  changed  and
opportunities  for  double  cropping  have  increased.  Since  the  1990s,
a  number  of  developments  have  taken  place  on  the  ground  that
call  for  new  cropping  calendar  research:  (1)  double  cropping  has
expanded  at  this  site  especially  in  the  last  5  years  with  govern-
ment  promoting  rice  production  (Diagne  et  al.,  2013)  and  (2)  several
additional  short  duration  varieties  have  been  introduced.  At  the
time  of  Dingkuhn  (1995),  medium  variety  Jaya  was   most  popu-
lar,  with  a  duration  for  direct  seeded  rice  ranging  from  118  to  192
days  depending  on  sowing  date  (Sié  et  al.,  1998).  Since  then,  short
duration  variety  Sahel108  with  a  duration  from  sowing  to  maturity
of  96–155  days  (direct  seeded  rice)  has  become  a  popular  variety
among  farmers  (Tanaka  et  al.,  2015).  Also  science  has  advanced
since  the  1990s.  Recently  new  research  on  phenology  (van  Oort
et  al.  (2011))  and  sterility  (Julia  and  Dingkuhn  (2012,  2013))  has
been  incorporated  into  the  ORYZA2000  crop  growth  model  (Van
Oort  et  al.  (2015a))  which  allows  for  simulating  not  only  steril-
ity  risk  but  also  yield.  One  of  the  ﬁndings  of  this  latest  study  was
that  good  yields  can  still  be  obtained  at  moderate  levels  of  sterility
(say  <30%);  this  is  possible  only  if  enough  spikelets  and  biomass
have  been  formed  at  ﬂowering.  For  a  source  limited  crop,  a  lim-
ited  reduction  in  the  sink  size  (=fertilised  spikelets)  has  no  effect
on  yield.  This  ﬁnding  suggests  that  the  previous  selection  of  “safe”
sowing  windows  by  Dingkuhn  (1995),  based  on  simulated  sterility
was  perhaps  too  strict.

Farmers  face  many  constraints  and  research  should  consider
their  objectives  and  constraints.  It  is  impossible  to  include  all  farm-
ers’  perspectives  here.  And  it  can  also  be  interesting  to  move  beyond
the  current  situation,  to  systematically  explore  what  would  be  pos-
sible  if  farmers’  constraints  would  be  alleviated.  We   address  all  the
above  mentioned  issues  in  the  following  way   in  this  paper.  Firstly,
we  include  in  a  rudimentary  way   a  vegetable  in  our  analysis  of  pos-
sible  crop  rotations.  Secondly,  we   consider  two  different  farmers’
objectives:  yield  maximisation  and  maximisation  of  yield  per  unit
time.  Thirdly,  we   investigate  not  only  optimal  sowing  dates  but  also
sowing  windows.  These  sowing  windows  tell  us  how  much  tem-
poral  ﬂexibility  there  is  in  the  cropping  calendar.  We   developed
a  model  for  constructing  cropping  calendars,  which  was   linked  to
the  ORYZA2000  model  for  rice.  For  the  vegetable  crop,  we  sim-
ply  blocked  a  part  of  the  year.  With  this  part  of  the  year  blocked,
we  used  ORYZA2000  to  simulate  potential  yields  as  a  function  of
sowing  dates  of  the  rice  crop(s).

The  biggest  steps  in  intensiﬁcation  can  be  made  by  increasing
the  number  of  crops  grown  per  year  (cropping  intensity).  Smaller
steps  in  intensiﬁcation  can  be  made  by  growing  medium  instead  of
short  duration  varieties.  Both  intensiﬁcations  are  considered  in  this

170

paper.  In  order  from  least  intensive  to  most  intensive  we  compared
the  following  crop  rotations:

1.  Rice  only  (single)
2.  Rice-vegetable  (double)
3.  Rice-rice  (double)
4.  Rice-rice-vegetable  (triple)
5.  Rice-rice–rice  (triple)

In  relation  to  ideotyping,  we  consider  two  traits  relevant  for  the
current  study  area:  crop  duration  and  tolerance  to  cold  sterility.
A  logical  follow-up  to  the  current  study  would  be  to  also  quantify
vegetable  production,  optimise  the  sowing  date  for  vegetables  and
add  a  gross  margin  calculation.  Such  was  impossible  at  the  time  of
writing  due  to  lack  of  data  on  vegetables  and  whole  farm  economics.

2.  Materials  &  methods

In  the  following  sections  we  describe  the  methods  for  cropping
calendar  construction,  the  phenological  models,  the  crop  growth
model  and  the  weather  data.  We   simulated  potential  yield.  Poten-
tial  yield  is  yield  of  a  crop  free  from  weeds,  pests  and  diseases,  with
ample  nutrition  and  water  and  with  no  soil  constraints.  Therefore
no  soil  data  or  irrigation  data  were  needed.  Although  actual  yields
are  often  much  lower  than  potential,  phenology  and  response  to
climatic  risks  is  similar  both  in  actual  and  potential  production.  All
simulated  yields  reported  in  the  paper  are  long  term  average  poten-
tial  yields,  i.e.  averaged  over  simulations  of  20  years  of  weather
data.

2.1.  Cropping  calendar  construction

A  new  cropping  calendar  construction  (CCC)  model  was
developed  to  investigate  intensiﬁcation  options.  The  CCC  model
generates  input  data  for  a  stand-alone  crop  growth  model,  in  this
case  the  ORYZA2000  model.  The  input  ﬁle  for  ORYZA2000  is  the  so
called  “rerun”  ﬁle  and  is  commonly  used  for  conducting  bulk  simu-
lations  with  the  “Wageningen”  family  of  crop  growth  models  (van
Ittersum  et  al.,  2003).  An  earlier  test  (not  shown)  conﬁrmed  that  the
same  CCC  model  could  also  be  used  to  investigate  options  for  potato
double  cropping  simulated  with  the  more  widely  used  WOFOST
model.  For  this  study  cropping  calendars  were  constructed  from  all
possible  combinations  of  the  following  components.

1.  Site:  Fanaye  in  Senegal,  about  150  km  inland  (16.633N,  14.917W)
with  20  years  of  weather  data  to  capture  climatic  variability
(years  1994–2013).  This  site  is  representative  of  the  middle  val-
ley  of  the  Senegal  River  in  the  Sahel.

2.  36  sowing  dates:  from  day  10  to  day  360  in  steps  of  10  days.
3.  5  Varieties  with  different  maturity  periods.  We  deﬁned  a  base-
line  variety  (Sahel108)  and  hypothetical  varieties  that  would
mature  systematically  earlier  (−20, 
−10  days)  and  later  (10,
20  days),  by  adjusting  the  length  of  the  basic  vegetative  phase
(BVP).  Of  the  different  growth  stages  in  rice  this  phase  is  known
to  be  the  most  variable  (Vergara  and  Chang,  1985).  As  the  base-
−10/−20
line  variety  Sahel108  is  a  short  duration  variety,  the 
days  varieties  can  be  considered  ultra-short  duration  varieties
and  the  +10/+20  days  varieties  can  be  considered  medium  dura-
tion  varieties.

4.  2  Varieties  differing  in  cold  tolerance:  normal  cold  sensitive  and
newly  developed  completely  cold  tolerant.  The  latter  is  more
“hypothetical”  and  serves  to  quantify  yield  losses  due  to  cold
sterility,  or  alternatively,  potential  yield  gains  possible  if  breed-
ers  develop  or  identify  such  a  suitable  cold  tolerant  variety.

5.  Minimum  20  days  between  harvesting  one  crop  and  sowing  the
×
next  (DURHASOW  =  20).  With  two  crops,  2 
  20  =  40  days  are
×
reserved  for  this,  with  3  crops,  3 
  20=60  days  are  reserved  for
the  period  in  between  crops.  Note  that  20  days  is  the  minimum,
actual  duration  between  two   crops  can  be  larger.  One  of  the
model  outputs  is  the  width  of  the  sowing  window;  a  wide  sow-
ing  window  indicates  the  rotation  is  possible  even  with  much
delay  between  two   crops.

6.  Different  parts  of  the  year  were  blocked  for  vegetable  cropping:
December–April  (5  months)  which  is  a  normal  duration  for  onion
or  tomato,  December-January  (2  months)  and  January-February
(2  months).  We   anticipate  that  a  rice-rice-vegetable  rotation  will
not  be  practically  possible  with  a  5  month  vegetable  crop.  We
use  the  scenarios  with  2  month  vegetables  to  explore  if  triple
cropping  would  be  possible  if  such  a  short  duration  vegetable
could  be  found.

For  each  possible  crop  rotation  two  sets  of  3600  simulations
(36  sowing  dates,  5  varieties,  20  years)  were  conducted:  one  set
for  a  cold  sensitive  variety  and  one  for  a  cold  tolerant  variety.
×
Thus  in  total  5 
  2  =  10  varieties  were  compared.  In  total  16  crop
rotations  were  simulated.  The  CCC  model  constructs  all  possi-
ble  single/double/triple  sowing  date  conﬁgurations,  taking  into
account  that:

1.  Growing  periods  may   not  overlap  and  this  should  also  go  well

across  calendar  years.

2.  There  must  be  at  least  DURHASOW  days  between  harvesting  one
crop  and  sowing  the  next  crop.  This  rule  is  applied  both  for  the
rice  and  the  vegetable  crop.

3.  We   considered  only  closed  annual  crop  rotations,  i.e.  we  ﬁtted
two   or  three  crops  into  one  year.  The  option  of  growing  for  exam-
ple  5  crops  in  2  years  (e.g.  see  Huong  et  al.  (2014))  was   not
considered  because  of  the  increased  chance  that  one  of  these
5  crops  would  be  a  rice  crop  exposed  to  severe  cold  sterility  in
the  cold  dry  season.

After  constructing  all  possible  sowing  date  conﬁgurations  for  a
given  crop  rotation  the  CCC  model  automatically  sorts  the  selected
sowing  date  conﬁgurations  either  maximising  total  yield  or  max-
imising  total  yield  per  total  duration.

2.2.  Phenological  models

To  assess  the  sensitivity  of  cropping  calendar  optimisation  to
uncertainty  in  phenology  models,  we   compared  simulated  crop
duration,  simulated  potential  yield  and  optimised  cropping  calen-
dars  constructed  with  two  different  phenological  models.  Direct
seeding  is  most  common  in  our  study  area;  therefore  we  consid-
ered  only  direct  seeding  systems.  From  the  study  site  (Fanaye)  plus
a  second  site  (Ndiaye),  a  dataset  with  sowing  date  and  emergence
data  was   available.  This  set  was  used  to  develop  a  model  to  pre-
dict  the  number  of  days  from  sowing  to  emergence  (Section  2.2.1).
Simulations  with  ORYZA2000  start  at  emergence.  From  historical
data  (2008–2014),  n  =  55  data  points  were  available  with  data  on
sowing  date,  50%  ﬂowering  date  and  maturity  date.  For  this  dataset
we  ﬁrst  estimated  the  emergence  date  as  in  Section  2.2.1.  Limited
data  were  available  on  duration  from  panicle  initiation  to  ﬂower-
ing.  Based  on  earlier  research  by  (de  Vries  et  al.,  2011)  we  estimated
this  duration  at  28  days.  For  the  phases  from  emergence  to  panicle
initiation,  panicle  initiation  to  ﬂowering  and  ﬂowering  to  matu-
rity,  two  phenological  models  were  applied,  one  using  the  more
common  temperature  sum  based  approach  (Section  2.2.2)  and  one
with  crop  duration  as  an  empirical  function  of  sowing  date  (Section
2.2.3).

2.2.1.  Sowing  to  emergence

ORYZA2000  simulations  start  at  emergence.  A  simple  empirical
model  was  used  to  predict  emergence  day  as  a  function  of  sow-
ing  day  (Fig.  1a).  Pre-germinated  seed  was  direct-seeded  (common
practice  in  our  study  area)  and  duration  to  emergence  recorded.
Total  duration  from  sowing  to  emergence  (DURSOWEM)  was  pre-
dicted  as  a  function  of  Sowing  Day  (SOW).  For  the  study  site
considered  in  this  paper  a  bilinear-exponential  model  proved  to
give  the  best  ﬁt:

where  durS  and  durL  are  the  shortest  and  longest  durations  from
sowing  to  emergence  in  days,  doyS  and  doyL  are  the  sowing  days
on  which  the  shortest  and  longest  durations  occur  and  parameters
b1SL,  b1LS  and  b2LS  are  estimated  such  that  the  linear  and  expo-
nential  curves  connect  at  doyS  and  doyL  and  the  best  ﬁt  through
observed  durations  is  obtained.  Parameters  used  in  this  model  are
listed  in  Table  1.

2.2.2.  TSUM  model

Emergence  day  EMD   was  calculated  as  SOW  +  DURSOWEM.  To
simulate  subsequent  phenological  phases  we  used  cardinal  tem-
peratures  as  reported  by  (van  Oort  et  al.,  2011)  for  the  baseline
variety  Sahel  108  (IR  13240-108-2-2-3):  TBD  =  15 ◦C,  TOD=34 ◦C
and  optimal  development  at  temperatures  higher  than  TOD.  Devel-
opment  rates  reported  by  (van  Oort  et  al.,  2011)  were  originally
calibrated  for  transplanted  rice  in  two  sites  (Ndiaye  and  Fanaye)
and  showed  interaction  with  the  estimated  transplanting  shock
parameter.  To  avoid  bias,  we  proceeded  with  the  abovementioned
cardinal  temperatures  and  estimated  new  development  rates  DVRI,
DVRJ,  DVRP  and  DVRR  as  used  in  ORYZA2000,  such  that  average
predicted  duration  equalled  average  observed  duration  for  the  dif-
ferent  developmental  stages  in  Fanaye.  These  development  rates
are  deﬁned  as  follows:
• DVRI  and  DVRJ  are  for  the  phase  from  emergence  to  panicle
initiation.  Since  previous  analyses  showed  the  baseline  variety
Sahel  108  is  not  photoperiod  sensitive  (van  Oort  et  al.,  2011),
the  same  development  rate  was  assumed  for  the  whole  period
from  emergence  to  panicle  initiation  (PI),  i.e.  not  making  a  dis-
tinction  between  development  rate  for  the  basic  vegetative  phase
(DVRI)  and  the  development  rate  for  the  photoperiod  sensitive
phase  (DVRJ).  Development  for  this  combined  phase  was  calcu-
lated  as  DVRI  =  DVRJ  =  (0.65–0)/TTEMDPI with  0  for  development

stage  “Emergence”,  0.65  is  the  development  stage  at  which  PI
occurs  and  TTEMDPI is  the  minimum  duration  (in  days)  from  emer-
gence  day  EMD   to  panicle  initiation  day  PI,  which  we   would
theoretically  ﬁnd  if  the  variety  were  constantly  grown  at  optimal
temperature;
• DVRP  =  (1.0-0.65)/TTPIFL =  Development 
the  panicle
development  phase,  which  runs 
from  development  stage
0.65–1.0,  starting  at  panicle  initiation  (PI)  and  ending  at  50%  ﬂow-
ering  (FL)  and  TTPIFL is,  in  analogy  with  the  above,  the  minimum
duration  of  this  phase  in  days,  which  we   would  theoretically  ﬁnd
if  the  variety  were  constantly  grown  at  optimal  temperature;
• DVRR  =  (2.0–1.0)/TTFLM =  Development  rate  for  the  grain  ﬁll-
ing  (reproductive)  phase,  which  runs  from  development  stage
1.0–2.0,  starting  at  ﬂowering  (FL)  and  ending  at  maturity  (M).

resulted 

DVRJ  =  0.018712, 

DVRI  =  0.018712,
DVRP  =  0.019009  and  DVRR  =  0.058208.  Note  that  these  devel-
opment  rates  were  calculated  not  with  temperature  sums  (unit
oCd)  but  with  normalised  thermal  time  TT  (unit  d).  Both  approaches
give  exactly  the  same  results.  Phenology  modellers  prefer  using
normalised  thermal  time  TT  because  it  allows  for  more  easily
comparing  models  with  different  cardinal  temperatures  (van  Oort
et  al.,  2011;  Yin  et  al.,  1995).  Fig.  1b  shows  observed  and  simulated
duration  from  emergence  to  maturity.

Next,  to  simulate  shorter  and  longer  duration  varieties,  devel-
opment  rates  DVRJ  and  DVRI  were  multiplied  with  0.7,  0.85,  1,  1.15
and  1.3  (+/−30%  and  +/−15%).  These  percentages  were  chosen  such
that  with  1.3,  the  average  increase  in  duration  was   20  days,  same  as
with  the  SOWDOY  model  below.  Only  DVRJ  and  DVRI  (for  the  veg-
etative  phase  from  emergence  to  panicle  initiation)  were  adjusted,
because  it  is  known  that  this  phase  shows  greatest  genetic  variation
between  varieties  (Vergara  and  Chang,  1985).

2.2.3.  SOWDOY  model

A  similar  model  as  in  Eq.  (1)  but  with  different  parameter  values,
(Table  1)  was  used  to  predict  the  total  duration  from  emergence
to  maturity  (DUREMMATb)  for  the  baseline  variety  Sahel  108  as
follows:

2.4.  Weather  data

where  DELTADUR  =  [−20,−10,0,10,20]  generates  varieties  with
20/10  days  shorter  duration  to  10/20  days  longer  duration  rela-
tive  to  the  baseline  variety  in  time  steps  of  10  days  with  duration
DUREMMATb.  Phenology  was   modelled  as  three  phases:  vegetative
(DUREPI,  days  from  emergence  to  panicle  initiation),  reproductive
(DURPIF,  days  from  panicle  initiation  to  ﬂowering)  and  grain  ﬁlling
(DURFLM,  days  from  ﬂowering  to  maturity).  According  to  Vergara
and  Chang  (1985)  durations  DURPIF  and  DURFLM  compared  with
DURSPI  are  relatively  much  less  sensitive  to  temperature.  We   there-
fore  ﬁxed  them  as  constants  (DURPIF  =  28d,  DURFLM  =  25d,  Table  1).
The  duration  of  the  vegetative  phase  was  then  calculated  as:

DUREPI 

=
  DUREMMAT 

−
  DURPIF 

−
  DURFLM 

(4)

Note  that  in  this  way,  varietal  differences  in  crop  duration  (Eq.

(3))  are  only  in  the  duration  of  the  vegetative  phase  (Eq.  (4)).

2.3.  ORYZA2000

2.3.1.  Subversions

Three  adapted  versions  of  the  ORYZA2000  model  were  devel-
oped,  based  on  model  comparisons  in  Van  Oort  et  al.  (2015a).
Subversion  ORYZA2000v2n13s14  (s14  in  short)  is  fully  docu-
mented  in  Van  Oort  et  al.  (2015a).  Subversion  s27  was  newly
developed  for  this  paper.  This  subversion  is  identical  to  subver-
sion  s14,  with  one  change,  namely  the  phenological  sub-model  was
replaced  by  the  SOWDOY  model  (Section  2.2.3).

Subversion  s28  is  similar  to  subversion  s27,  but  with  cold  steril-
ity  equations  and  parameters  set  back  to  the  original  equations  for
ORYZA2000.  These  original  equations  predict  no  cold  sterility  in  the
Fanaye  location  (Van  Oort  et  al.  (2015a)).

Thus  subversions  s14  and  s27  represent  the  normal  variety  and
subversion  s28  represents  a  hypothetical  completely  cold  tolerant
variety.  Whether  such  a  variety  can  be  found  in  other  parts  of  the
world  or  bred  speciﬁcally  for  the  Sahel  region  is  a  topic  for  further
research.  This  study  is  exploratory  in  the  sense  that  it  shows  what
yield  gains  and  calendar  modiﬁcations  would  be  possible  if  such  a
variety  were  found.

2.3.2.  Validation

In  this  paper  we   validated  the  s14  and  s27  models  with  the

following  observed  datasets:

1.  observed  Sahel  108  yield  data  from  (de  Vries  et  al.,  2011)  with
15  monthly  staggered  sowing  dates  in  Fanaye  in  2006  and  2007
2.  observed  IR64  yield  data  from  (Stuerz  et  al.,  2014)  with  6  bi-
monthly  sowing  dates  in  Fanaye  in  2009/2010.  Previously  (de
Vries  et  al.,  2011)  showed  that  crop  duration  and  yield  levels  of
Sahel108  and  IR64  are  similar.

Weather  data  were  taken  from  the  AfricaRice  weather  stations
which  have  over  time  been  operational  at  the  Fanaye  site.  This
weather  station  dataset  showed  many  gaps.  Missing  data  were
ﬁlled  in  with  data  from  the  POWER  database  (http://power.larc.
nasa.gov/).  The  POWER  database  is  known  to  have  systematic  errors
in  its  minimum  and  maximum  temperature  while  radiation  values
compare  well  with  station  data  (White  et  al.  (2008);  White  et  al.
(2011)).  Therefore  daily  Tmin  and  Tmax  were  corrected  following
the  procedure  described  by  (Van  Wart  et  al.,  2015).  We   are  not
aware  of  validation  studies  in  which  the  accuracy  of  relative  humid-
ity  in  the  POWER  database  was   tested.  For  our  study  site  we  found
a  large  difference  between  long  term  average  mean  daily  relative
humidity  in  POWER  (32%)  and  our  station  data  (45%),  see  Fig.  2b.
Therefore,  the  same  method  developed  by  (Van  Wart  et  al.,  2015)
for  correcting  Tmin(POWER)  and  Tmax(POWER)  was   also  applied

to  correct  the  dew  point  temperature  Tdew(POWER).  The  differ-
ence  between  RH(POWER)  and  station  RH  is  not  that  strange  if  we
consider  that  RH(POWER)  is  a  spatial  average  over  a  satellite  pixel
of  approximately  110  km  size,  which  includes  a  lot  of  dry  savannah
surrounding  the  Senegal  river,  whereas  the  AfricaRice  weather  sta-
tion  is  located  close  to  the  river  and  surrounded  by  ﬂooded  paddy
ﬁelds,  from  which  evaporating  water  contributes  to  a  higher  rel-
ative  humidity.  Annual  CO2  concentrations  were  taken  from  the
Mauna  Loa  record  and  effects  of  CO2  were  modelled  as  described
in  (Bouman  et  al.,  2001).

2.5.  Observed  sowing  dates

This  paper  is  exploratory  in  the  sense  of  investigating  which
crop  rotations  are  viable  and  within  these,  which  sowing  dates
give  highest  long  term  average  potential  yields.  We   compared  opti-
mised  sowing  dates  with  observed  sowing  dates.  A  comparison
of  causes  of  discrepancies,  including  climatic  and  socio-economic
drivers,  was  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper.  Farmers’  sowing  dates
for  the  wet  season  were  extracted  from  unpublished  survey  data  by
M.  Diagne  (co-author  of  this  paper).  Surveys  were  conducted  from
2002  to  2010  among  on  average  45  farmers  per  year  in  our  study
area,  from  these  we  identiﬁed  annual  earliest  and  average  sowing
dates  per  year.

3.  Results

3.1.  Phenology

shows  observed  and  simulated  duration  from  emergence  to  matu-
rity.  The  temperature  sum  (TSUM)  based  model  predicted  duration
from  emergence  to  maturity  with  a  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE)
of  8.3  days  and  a  maximum  error  of  19  days.  For  sowing  on  day
100–150  the  TSUM  model  predicted  systematically  shorter  dura-
tion  than  observed.  During  day  250–300  the  TSUM  model  predicted
systematically  longer  duration  than  observed.  With  the  SOWDOY
model  the  duration  from  emergence  to  maturity  is  predicted  with
a  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE)  of  5.7  days  and  a  maximum  abso-
lute  error  of  16  days.  Similar  RMSE  values  were  reported  before  in
(van  Oort  et  al.,  2011).  The  effect  of  biased  phenology  predictions
was  reported  in  (Van  Oort  et  al.,  2015a),  Fig.  1b  shows  both  phenol-
ogy  have  little  to  no  bias.  By  reporting  long  term  average  potential
yields,  one  may   expect  cancelling  out  of  errors  of  overestimation  of
duration  and  underestimation  of  duration.  We   therefore  consider
the  accuracy  acceptable  for  the  study  presented  here.

The  SOWDOY  model  predicts  duration  more  accurately  than  the
TSUM  model  and  avoids  the  systematic  errors  made  by  the  TSUM
model  during  days  100–150  and  250–300.  Predictions  by  the  two
phenological  models  are  not  identical  but  are  quite  similar.  There-
fore  one  may   expect  conclusions  on  intensiﬁcation  options  based
on  the  two   models  to  be  similar.  To  avoid  duplication  of  results  we
present  in  the  sections  below  only  the  results  of  the  most  accurate
(=SOWDOY)  phenology  model.  In  Section  4.2  we  discuss  sensitivity
of  our  results  to  the  choice  of  the  phenological  model.

Fig.  3  shows  validation  results  for  simulated  yields  in  speciﬁc
years.  Clearly,  model  predictions  are  not  perfect.  Both  the  s14  and

Vries  et  al.  in  2006  for  the  20  March  and  18  April  sowings.  There
are  also  large  discrepancies  within  and  between  the  two   observed
datasets.  The  very  high  yield  levels  observed  by  de  Vries  et  al.  for
the  March/April  2006  (10.2  and  7.6  t  DM  ha−1)  were  not  observed
in  his  18  March/18  April  2007  sowings  (6.4  and  5.0  t  DM  ha−1)  and
also  not  by  Stuertz  (19  April  2010  sowing:  7.7  t  DM  ha−1).  Aver-
age  predicted  yields  for  these  March/April  sowing  dates  were  6.8
and  5.8  t  ha−1 with  the  s27  and  s14  models.  Mean  errors  (averaged
−0.642  t  DM  ha−1
over  all  sowing  dates)  were 
with  the  two  phenology  models  (SOWDOY  model  s27  and  TSUM
model  s14).  The  higher  yields  and  higher  accuracy  with  model  s27
are  consistent  with  the  longer  and  more  accurate  predicted  grow-
ing  period  for  sowing  in  the  March–April  period  (DOY  80  and  110
in  Fig.  1b.).  Although  Fig.  3  still  shows  for  a  number  of  data  points
large  discrepancies  between  observation  and  simulation,  one  can
also  note  that  both  models  capture  three  general  patterns  well,
namely  the  period  of  severe  cold  sterility  for  sowing  in  October
and  November,  the  start  and  the  end  of  the  period  in  which  severe
cold  sterility  occurs  (sowing  in  September  and  December)  and  the
decrease  of  yields  with  sowing  date  from  January  to  September.
Therefore,  we  consider  these  simulations  sufﬁciently  accurate  for
the  calendar  optimisations  presented  below.

3.3.  Simulated  heat  and  cold  sterility

Fig.  4  shows  that  both  heat  and  cold  sterility  occur  throughout
the  year.  Heat  sterility  ranges  from  10  to  30%.  Apparently  in  this
environment  two  adaptations  to  heat,  earlier  ﬂowering  at  higher
temperatures  and  high  transpirational  cooling  at  low  RH  =  high  VPD
(Julia  and  Dingkuhn,  2012,  2013;  Van  Oort  et  al.,  2015a,  2014)
cancel  out  the  expected  increase  in  heat  sterility  at  higher  air  tem-
peratures  in  the  hot  dry  season  (Fig.  2).  Cold  sterility  occurs  for
sowing  dates  between  day  230  and  70  (August–March).  As  shown
by  (Van  Oort  et  al.,  2015a),  small  levels  of  sterility  do  not  nec-
essarily  cause  yield  loss.  A  crop  that  produces  a  large  number  of

spikelets  would  still  be  source  limited  even  if  the  number  of  fer-
tilised  spikelets  is  reduced  a  bit  due  to  sterility.  The  period  with
cold  sterility  (sowing  dates  230-70)  is  therefore  80  days  longer  than
the  period  with  yield  loss  (sowing  dates  250–10)  (Fig.  4c,  d).  Cold
sterility  causes  yield  loss  for  sowing  days  250–10  (7  Sept.–10  Jan.,
125  days),  with  a  peak  for  sowing  in  days  280–310  (October).  The
long  period  is  due  to  inter-annual  variability  in  temperatures.  Fig.  4
is  for  the  baseline  short  duration  variety  Sahel108.  For  medium
duration  varieties  with  20  days  longer  duration,  the  sowing  dates  to
be  avoided  shift  to  20  days  earlier  and  for  shorter  duration  varieties
sowing  dates  with  highest  risk  are  20  days  later.

3.4.  Yield  gains  from  cold  tolerant  varieties

We   can  quantify  possible  yield  gains  from  cold  tolerant  varieties
from  Table  2.  For  example  in  single  cropping  with  the  baseline  short
duration  variety,  long  term  average  potential  yields  increase  from
8.7  to  10.4  t/ha  (Table  2,  sim.  2,4),  a  yield  gain  of  +1.7  t/ha  or  +19%.
These  yield  gains  differ  depending  on  cropping  intensity  and  phe-
nology  of  the  variety.  The  yield  gain  is  about  1  t/ha  (5–8%)  for  the
medium  duration  varieties,  1.7  t/ha  (10–19%)  for  the  short  duration
varieties  and  2.3  t/ha  (13%)  in  triple  cropping.  This  yield  gain  occurs
because  a  cold  tolerant  variety  can  be  sown  earlier  than  the  cur-
rent  varieties,  exposing  it  to  a  cooler  climate  with  a  longer  growing
season.  For  example  comparing  the  baseline  short  duration  variety
(Table  2,  sim.  2,4),  sowing  date  would  shift  from  day  10  to  day  320
(45  days  earlier)  and  duration  would  increase  from  141  to  175  days
(+34  days)  and  for  the  medium  duration  variety  sowing  date  would
shift  from  day  330  to  day  320  (10  days  earlier)  and  duration  would
increase  from  186  to  195  days  (+9  days).

It  should  be  noted  that  the  yield  gains  quantiﬁed  here  are  the
maximum  attainable  yield  gains,  because  we   compared  the  base-
line  variety  with  a  hypothetical  completely  cold  tolerant  variety.
For  an  intermediately  cold  tolerant  variety,  also  the  yield  gain
would  be  less  than  quantiﬁed  here.

Fig.  5.  Possible  sowing  windows  for  double  and  triple  cropping.  a.  Rice-rice,  2x  short  duration  variety,  20  days  between  harvesting  one  rice  crop  and  sowing  the  next.
Interpretation:  if  crop  1  is  sown  on  day  10  (x-axis),  then  crop  2  can  be  sown  between  day  160  and  260  (left  y-axis)  and  still  mature  before  day  20  days  before  day  10.  If  crop
1   is  sown  on  day  360  (x-axis)  then  crop  2  can  be  sown  between  day  150  and  day  250  (right  y-axis)  and  still  mature  20  days  before  day  360.  These  sowing  windows  therefore
come  on  top  of  the  assumed  minimum  duration  of  20  days  between  harvesting  one  crop  and  sowing  the  next.  The  sowing  window  is  70–130  days  wide.  b.  Rice-rice,  2x
medium  duration  variety.  The  sowing  window  is  40–80  days  wide.  (Table  2,  sim  6).  c.  Rice-vegetable.  Dashed  line  shows  period  blocked  for  the  December-April  Vegetable.
A   short  duration  crop  can  then  be  sown  from  day  140  to  210  and  still  mature  20  days  before  1  December.  The  sowing  window  is  70  days  wide.  d.  Rice-vegetable.  Dashed  line
shows  period  blocked  for  the  December-April  Vegetable.  A  medium  duration  crop  can  then  be  sown  from  day  140  to  190  and  still  mature  20  days  before  1  December.  The
sowing   window  is  50  days  wide.  (Table  2,  sim  10).  e.  Rice-rice-rice.  Triple  rice  cropping  systems  proved  only  to  be  possible  with  varieties  with  shorter  crop  duration  than
the   baseline.  Even  then,  the  window  is  narrow:  10–40  days  (Table  2,  sim  11).  f.  Rice-rice-vegetable.  January-February  (J-F)  period  reserved  for  vegetable  crop.  Rice  crop  1  is
sown   between  day  80  and  120,  rice  crop  2  is  sown  between  day  210  and  240.  The  sowing  window  is  30–40  days  wide.  (Table  2,  sim  14).

3.5.  Trade-off  between  ﬂexibility  and  rice  yield

Table  2  presents  a  comparison  of  all  possible  crop  rotations  in
order  of  increasing  cropping  intensity.  To  the  far  right  the  table
shows  indicators  at  the  crop  rotation  level:  total  rice  yield,  rice
yield  per  number  of  days  in  which  rice  is  growing,  total  number
of  days  in  which  crops  are  growing  including  the  1,  2  or  3  times
20  days  in  between  crops  and  in  the  last  column  how  much  “ﬂex-
ibility”  is  in  the  system.  For  example  in  simulation  5,  one  rice
crop  is  growing  from  day  160–278  (118  days)  and  one  from  day
×
330–131  (166  days).  Total  duration  is  118  +  166  +  2 
  20  =  324  days.
Thus  there  is  at  most  365–324  =  41  days  “ﬂexibility”.  Sowing  of  both
crops  might  be  delayed  by  20  days  per  crop  and  it  would  still  be
possible  to  grow  two  rice  crops  in  one  year.

We  visualise  this  ﬂexibility  in  sowing  windows  in  Fig.  5,  for
selected  crop  rotations  from  Table  2.  We   can  see  how  the  sowing
window  becomes  narrower  as  cropping  intensity  increases.  There
is  a  clear  trade-off  between  ﬂexibility  and  rice  yield.  We   visualise
this  trade-off  in  Fig.  6.  The  sowing  windows  in  Fig.  5  and  the  ﬂex-
ibility  in  the  last  column  of  Table  2  show  that  triple  cropping  of
rice  is  very  difﬁcult  if  not  impossible.  Triple  rice  is  only  possible
with  shorter  duration  varieties  than  our  baseline  Sahel108  and  even
then  sowing  windows  are  only  10–40  days  wide  (Fig.  5e).  Rice-rice-
vegetable  was  only  possible  with  a  2  month  vegetable  and  also  then,
the  sowing  windows  are  only  30–40  days  wide  (Fig.  5f).  There  is
more  ﬂexibility  in  sowing  windows  for  double  cropping  (Fig.  5a–d).
Therefore,  rice–rice  double  cropping  options  seem  most  relevant
and  will  be  analysed  in  more  detail.

Fig.  6.  Trade-off  between  ﬂexibility  and  total  potential  rice  yield.  Based  on  data
reported  in  Tables  2  and  3.

3.6.  Optimal  sowing  dates

Fig.  7  shows  a  selection  of  optimised  crop  rotations.  Table  2
shows  all  optimised  crop  rotations  when  maximising  rice  yields.
Table  3  shows  all  optimised  crop  rotations  when  maximising  rice
yield  per  unit  time.  With  yield  maximisation  as  the  objective  a
long  term  average  potential  rice  yield  of  10.3  t  ha−1 is  obtained
with  sowing  on  day  330  (26  Nov.)  with  a  medium  duration  vari-
ety  (Table  2,  sim  1  and  sim  5).  For  the  baseline  short  duration
variety  optimum  sowing  date  is  45  days  later,  on  day  10  (10  Jan.),
and  potential  yield  is  8.7  t  ha−1 (Table  2,  sim  2  and  sim  6).  With
a  completely  cold  tolerant  variety,  optimal  sowing  date  shifts  to
early  November  (day  320,  16  Nov.)  and  potential  yield  is  11.2  or
10.4  t  ha−1 for  the  medium/short  duration  variety  (Table  2,  sim
3,4,7,8).  Thus  crop  genetics  (duration  and  cold  tolerance)  affect
optimised  sowing  date  and  the  associated  yields  attainable  for
these  sowing  dates.

Maximising  yield  and  maximising  yield  per  duration  lead  to  dif-
ferent  optimised  sowing  dates.  Maximum  yield  is  obtained  with
sowing  on  day  330–10  (Fig.  7a,  Table  2,  sim  1  and  sim  5).  Maximum
yield  per  crop  duration  is  obtained  with  a  completely  different  sow-
ing  on  day,  namely  day  140–160  (Fig.  7b,  Table  3,  sim  1  and  sim  5).
For  the  medium  duration  variety  maximising  yield  per  duration
leads  to  lower  yields  (8.8  vs  10.3  t  ha−1)  and  higher  yield  per  dura-
tion,  80  vs  62  kg  ha−1 d-1,  (Table  2  and  3,  sim  1).  Total  duration  is
less  when  maximising  yield  per  duration  and  therefore  ﬂexibility
is  higher  (see  also  the  open  symbols  in  Fig.  6,  which  are  shifted
upwards,  indicating  higher  ﬂexibility).  Thus  the  objective  of  the
farmer  (what  to  maximise)  affects  optimal  sowing  date  and  the
associated  yields.

Fig.  4a  shows  that  predicted  long  term  average  potential  yields
for  the  cold  sensitive  variety  decrease  gradually  for  sowing  after
day  150.  With  yield  maximisation  the  model  suggests  sowing  the
second  crop  as  early  as  possible  after  the  cold  dry  season  crop.  Opti-
mised  sowing  dates  in  the  double  cropping  systems  according  to
our  modelling  results  are  around  day  160  (early  June)  which  is  one
to  two  months  before  the  start  of  the  wet  season  (Fig.  7).  Fig.  7
shows  for  both  the  rice–rice  rotation  and  the  rice-vegetable  rota-
tion  that  there  is  room  for  delaying  this  crop  by  about  60  days.  There
is  therefore  enough  time  to  sow  the  wet  season  crop  later  (=at  the
start  of  the  wet   season)  and  still  sow  a  cold  dry  season  crop  (rice  or
vegetable)  in  early  December.

3.7.  Observed  sowing  dates

Comparing  optimised  sowing  dates  with  observed  sowing  dates
for  the  warm  wet  season  we   found  our  model  recommends  sow-
ing  earlier  than  farmers  do.  Earliest  farmers  sow  around  day  180

Fig.  7.  Optimised  cropping  calendars  for  single,  double  and  triple  cropping  for  different  objectives:  maximise  Yield  (a)  or  maximise  Yield/Duration  (b).  Horizontal  solid
bars   =  rice  sowing  to  harvesting;  horizontal  dashed  =  vegetable.  The  peak  shows  the  long  term  average  rainfall  distribution  (long  term  average  per  dekad,  right  axis).  From
top   to  bottom  the  cropping  calendars  shown  correspond  with  simulations  15,  9,  5  and  1,  details  of  which  can  be  found  in  Tables  2  and  3.  Note  the  large  difference  in  optimal
sowing   date  for  the  rice  and  the  rice–rice  crop  rotations:  with  yield  maximisation  a  rice  crop  is  sown  in  November,  when  yield  per  crop  duration  is  maximised  this  crop  is
sown   January.

(29  Jun.)  which  is  around  the  start  of  the  wet  season,  the  majority
sows  around  day  215  (3  August),  some  time  after  the  start  of  the
wet  season.  Our  model  on  the  contrary  recommends  sowing  around
day  140–160  i.e.  20  May–9  June  (Tables  2  and  3,  sim  5–10).  Farmers
sow  on  average  55  days  later  than  proposed  by  our  model.  Even  the
earliest-sowing  farmers  sow  20  days  later  than  optimal  according
to  our  model.  For  the  medium  duration  variety  the  long  term  aver-
age  potential  yield  for  the  optimal  sowing  date  (DOY  160)  in  the
wet  season  is  8.7  t  ha−1,  whereas  for  farmers’  average  sowing  date
(around  day  215)  in  the  wet  season  it  is  7.7  t  ha−1,  or  12%  lower.
For  the  short  duration  variety,  potential  yields  are  7.7  t  ha−1 at  DOY
160  and  6.5  t  ha−1 for  farmers’  average  sowing  date  (16%  lower).
The  only  cases  in  which  optimised  sowing  dates  were  closer  to
actual  farmers  sowing  dates  was  when  in  the  CCC  model,  a  veg-
etable  prevented  rice  sowing  at  a  date  that  would  give  highest
yield.

3.8.  Intensiﬁcation  options

Previous  sections  showed  that  triple  cropping  is  very  difﬁcult  to
realise  because  ﬂexibility  is  small.  It  was  not  possible  to  ﬁt  three
baseline  varieties  in  one  year,  but  triple  cropping  was   possible  with
the  baseline  and  two  ultra-short  duration  crops  (Table  2,  sim  11,12).
Long  term  average  total  potential  yield  for  triple  rice  is  18.6  t  ha−1
(Table  2  sim  11)  and  20.9  t  ha−1 for  the  cold  tolerant  variety  (Table  2
sim  12).  A  double  crop  with  medium  duration  varieties  gives  total
yields  of  19.0  t  ha−1 and  20.1  t  ha−1 for  the  normal  and  cold  tolerant
variety  (Table  2,  sim  5,7).  Thus  total  yield  gains  of  triple  rice  rela-
tive  to  double  rice  are  small,  also  with  cold  tolerant  varieties,  while
ﬂexibility  is  much  lower.  Results  showed  the  possibility  of  triple-
cropping  rice-rice-vegetable  with  a  2-month  vegetable  (Table  2,
sim  13–16),  but  also  this  crop  rotation  has  very  narrow  sowing  win-
dows  (Fig.  5)  and  low  overall  ﬂexibility  (6–45  days,  Table  2).  More
promising  are  the  double  cropping  systems.  Simulated  rice  poten-
tial  yields  in  the  double  cropping  systems  are  almost  twice  that  of
single  cropping  systems:  8.7–10.3  t  ha−1 for  the  normal  cold  sensi-
tive  varieties  in  single  cropping  and  16.4–19.0  t  ha−1 for  the  double
crops  (Table  2,  sim  1,2,5,6).  Should  breeders  succeed  at  identify-
ing  a  cold  tolerant  variety,  the  cold  dry  season  rice  crop  could  be
sown  earlier  (early  November  instead  of  mid-January),  resulting  in
a  longer  growing  season  and  higher  total  yields  (18.4–20.2  t  ha−1,
Table  2  sim  7,8).  In  single  rice  cropping  systems,  a  shift  from  short
duration  varieties  to  medium  duration  varieties  could  increase
yields  by  19%  (Table  2,  sim  1  vs  2,  8.7-  >  10.3  t  ha−1).  For  double  rice
cropping  systems,  a  shift  from  short  duration  varieties  to  medium
duration  varieties  could  increase  yields  by  16%  (Table  2,  sim  5  vs
6,  16.4-  >  19.0  t  ha−1).  In  double  cropping  systems,  development  of

a  cold  tolerant  variety  would  allow  yields  to  increase  by  5–10%
(Table  2,  sim  5  vs  7  and  6  vs  8).

4.  Discussion

Twenty  years  ago  Dingkuhn  (1995)  concluded  for  our  study  area
that  double  cropping  is  possible  but  subject  to  severe  time  con-
straints.  This  conclusion  was   drawn  based  on  simulated  sterilities
and  simulations  with  a  medium  duration  variety.  Since  then  short
duration  varieties  have  been  released,  which  has  increased  the  via-
bility  of  double  cropping.  An  important  scientiﬁc  insight  has  been
the  ﬁnding  that,  if  a  rice  crop  produces  a  large  number  of  spikelets
and  source  limitation  occurs  due  to  a  short  grain  ﬁlling  period,
then  a  limited  increase  in  sterility  (reduced  sink  size)  would  not
lead  to  a  yield  reduction.  This  was  also  shown  in  Section  3.3  of  this
paper,  where  the  period  with  cold  sterility  was  shown  to  be  80  days
longer  than  the  period  with  yield  loss  due  to  cold.  According  to  the
current  study  sowing  is  possible  in  January–February  with  good
yields  despite  some  sterility  (Fig.  4).  This  is  different  from  previous
simulations  by  Dingkuhn,  which  led  to  the  current  recommended
sowing  date  of  15  March  for  the  dry  season.  New  results  on  yields,
observed  and  simulated,  suggest  that  the  abovementioned  study
by  Dingkuhn  based  on  minimising  sterility  was  too  restrictive  for
sowing  dates  in  January  and  February  in  our  study  area.  The  release
of  short  duration  varieties  and  the  new  insight  on  the  interaction
between  fertility,  source  limitation  and  spikelet  number  theoret-
ically  lead  to  a  more  optimistic  view  on  prospects  for  rice  double
cropping.  But  this  was  to  date  not  quantiﬁed.  The  current  analysis
ﬁlls  this  gap.

In  the  book  by  (Miezan  et  al.,  1997)  more  analyses  were  pre-
sented  on  rice  double  cropping.  (Matlon,  1997)  noted  the  need  to
look  more  broadly  for  other  options  and  not  only  at  rice–rice  double
cropping  and  the  need  to  include  the  farmers’  perspective.  Twenty
years  after,  we   ﬁnd  that  while  there  has  been  more  research  on
farmers’  constraints  and  objectives,  data  collected  are  still  insufﬁ-
cient  for  whole  farm  economic  analysis  and  are  almost  exclusively
about  rice  farming  with  little  to  no  data  collection  on  other  crops
(Haefele  et  al.,  2002;  Krupnik  et  al.,  2012;  Le  Gal  and  Papy,  1998;
Poussin  et  al.,  2006;  Poussin  et  al.,  2005;  Tanaka  et  al.,  2015).  With
this  in  mind  we  included  other  crops  in  a  rudimentary  method,  by
blocking  a  part  of  the  year  for  vegetable  cropping.  We   interviewed
some  farmers  and  discussed  with  them  the  labour  and  economic
issues  in  rice-vegetable  cropping  (Section  4.4)  but  readily  admit
that  a  more  thorough  socio-economic  analysis  is  needed.

We  quantiﬁed  ﬂexibility  as  an  important  indicator  of  the  via-
bility  of  crop  rotations.  How  much  ﬂexibility  is  needed  will  differ
between  farmers  and  can  change  over  time  if  progress  is  made  with
mechanisation  and  improved  access  to  seeds  and  credit.  This  study

is  an  exploratory  analysis:  we  explore  what  yield  gains  are  pos-
sible  should  these  constraints  be  alleviated.  It  shows  what  yield
gains  are  theoretically  possible  by  shifting  to  medium  duration
varieties,  shifting  sowing  dates,  breeding  for  cold  tolerant  varieties
and  increasing  the  cropping  intensity.

4.1.  Main  ﬁndings

For  a  site  in  Senegal,  representing  the  middle  valley  of  the  Sene-
gal  River  in  the  Sahel,  we  investigated  options  for  intensiﬁcation,  by
varying  sowing  dates,  variety  types  and  number  of  crops  per  year.
In  summary,  the  analyses  in  this  paper  provide  clear  outcomes  on
options  for  intensiﬁcation:

1.  Double  cropping  is  possible
2.  Triple  cropping  is  almost  impossible,  except  with  very  tight  plan-
ning  or  a  rice-rice-vegetable  rotation  with  a  2  month  vegetable
3.  Within  single  and  double  cropping  systems,  intensiﬁcation  is
possible  by  adopting  medium  duration  rice  varieties  instead  of
short  duration  varieties

The  analysis  was  exploratory  in  the  sense  that  potential  yields
were  simulated  while  we  are  aware  that  in  many  cases,  farmers  face
many  constraints  and  actual  yields  are  often  lower  (Tanaka  et  al.,
2015),  while  unplanted  periods  between  crops  are  often  larger  than
the  minimum  of  20  days  assumed  in  this  paper.  Our  analysis  shows
that  double  cropping  (rice–rice  or  rice-vegetable)  is  possible  and
triple  rice–rice-vegetable  cropping  is  only  possible  where  farm-
ers  have  good  control  of  the  timing  of  their  operations  and  where
a  short  (2  months)  duration  vegetable  is  available.  Most  promis-
ing  options  for  intensiﬁcation  are  therefore  to  shift  from  single  to
double  cropping  and  to  grow  medium  instead  of  short  duration
varieties.  Both  are  available  in  the  Senegal  middle  valley,  e.g.,  pop-
ular  short  duration  cv.  Sahel108  (used  as  the  baseline  variety  in
this  paper)  and  medium  duration  variety  Sahel202  (Tanaka  et  al.,
2015).  We   know  that  single  rice,  rice–rice  and  rice-vegetable  rota-
tions  exist  and  that  double  cropped  area  is  expanding,  but  accurate
area  estimates  and  dynamics  are  not  available.  The  value  of  the
exploratory  analysis  presented  here  is  that  it  shows  which  options
for  intensiﬁcation  are  and  which  ones  are  currently  not  possible.
Whether  they  can  be  implemented  in  practice  depends  on  timely
availability  of  labour,  machinery,  water,  seed  and  fertiliser.

Methodologically,  the  approach  developed  adds  something  new
to  previous  models  for  crop  rotation  optimisation.  Compared  to
models  like  APSIM  and  DSSAT  (Holzworth  et  al.,  2014;  Jones
et  al.,  2003;  Keating  et  al.,  2003)  (Holzworth  et  al.,  2014;  Jones
et  al.,  2003),  our  model  allows  for  systematic  comparison  of  large
numbers  of  crop  rotations,  including  associated  climatic  risks.  Com-
pared  to  specialised  models  for  comparing  crop  rotations  (Dogliotti
et  al.,  2003;  Huong  et  al.,  2014)  our  analysis  adds  a  more  mecha-
nistic  simulation  of  climatic  risks  and  effects  of  varietal  differences.
Compared  to  ideotyping  studies,  our  analysis  is  an  ideotyping  study
at  the  crop  rotation  level,  as  opposed  to  previous  studies  which  only
considered  single  crops.  As  in  (Dingkuhn,  1995)  we  quantiﬁed  ﬂex-
ibility,  which  we  visualised  here  by  the  width  of  the  bands  in  Fig.  5.
Such  ﬂexibility  is  very  important  for  farmers  who   cope  with  having
to  divide  their  labour  time  over  different  crops  and  who   often  suf-
fer  from  late  availability  of  machinery  and  other  resources  (Connor
et  al.,  2008;  Haefele  et  al.,  2002;  Tanaka  et  al.,  2015).

4.2.  Phenology

Two  phenological  models  were  used.  The  SOWDOY  model  more
accurately  predicted  phenology  for  the  study  site  and  therefore  we
used  this  model  to  investigate  intensiﬁcation  options.  Disadvan-
tages  of  this  model  are  that  it  is  site  speciﬁc  and  that  it  did  not

Fig.  8.  Comparison  of  simulated  crop  duration  (a)  and  yield  (b)  for  direct-seeded  baseline  variety  Sahel108,  with  the  SOWDOY  phenology  model  (grey)  and  with  the  TSUM
model   (black).  Fig.  8a:  the  TSUM  simulated  different  crop  duration  for  each  year,  resulting  in  the  scatter  of  black  points,  the  SOWDOY  model  (grey  line)  does  not  predict
interannual  variability  in  crop  duration.  (b):  error  bars  show  minimum  and  maximum  over  20  years  of  weather  data.  (c)  and  (d):  totals  calculated  based  on  cropping  calendar

simulate  interannual  variation  in  phenology.  A  TSUM  model  can
potentially  also  be  used  with  the  same  parameters  for  other  sites,
pending  successful  validation.  We   investigated  the  sensitivity  of
our  results  to  the  choice  of  phenological  model.  Fig.  8  presents
the  comparison  of  yields  and  crop  rotations  simulated  with  these
two  phenological  sub-models.  The  two  largest  differences  in  sim-
ulated  yields  (Fig.  8b)  are  that  (i)  for  sowing  dates  10–200,  the
TSUM  model  predicts  0–1  t  ha−1 lower  yields  and  (ii)  the  period
with  severe  yield  loss  due  to  cold  sterility  is  shifted  10–20  days
to  the  right.  Similarities  between  simulated  yields  in  Fig.  8b  are
the  dates  on  which  highest  yields  are  simulated,  showing  peaks
at  sowing  dates  10  and  150,  for  which  simulated  potential  yields
are  very  similar  for  ORYZA2000  subversions  with  the  two  different
phenological  models.  As  a  result  of  these  two  similarities,  optimised
cropping  calendars  are  almost  the  same  for  the  two  models  and
result  in  almost  the  same  total  days  and  total  yield  (Fig.  8c  and  d)
for  the  20  crop  rotations  considered  in  Table  2.  Both  with  the  SOW-
DOY  model  and  with  the  TSUM  model,  optimised  sowing  dates  are
around  sowing  dates  10  and  150.  Therefore  for  this  speciﬁc  site  we
come  to  the  same  conclusions  on  optimal  sowing  dates,  potential
yields  and  options  for  intensiﬁcation.  More  detailed  calibrations  of
a  temperature  sum  based  model,  for  example  with  specialised  cal-
ibration  models  (van  Oort  et  al.  (2011),  (Archontoulis  et  al.,  2014),
(Dingkuhn  et  al.,  2015))  could  further  increase  the  accuracy  of  the
analyses  presented  in  this  paper,  as  would  more  detailed  calibration
of  the  crop  growth  simulation.

4.3.  ORYZA2000

Models  were  used  in  this  paper  to  answer  two  questions.  Firstly:
how  many  crops  (including  choice  of  5  varietal  types  with  different
duration  and  cold  tolerance)  can  be  cultivated  successively  in  one
year?  And  secondly:  what  are  their  optimal  sowing  dates?  Calendar
construction  strictly  does  not  require  a  crop  growth  model,  it  can
be  done  with  phenology  models  alone.  We   are  quite  conﬁdent  on
the  results  the  possible  number  of  crops  per  year,  as  errors  in  the
phenology  model  are  small  and  with  two  different  phenological

models,  we  came  to  similar  conclusions.  The  answer  to  the  sec-
ond  question  was   based  on  simulated  yields  with  the  ORYZA2000
model.  Yields  and  climatic  risks  were  simulated  with  adapted  sub-
versions  s14  and  s27  of  the  ORYZA2000v2n13  model,  for  which  we
previously  assessed  the  accuracy  in  (Van  Oort  et  al.,  2015a)  and  for
which  we   presented  an  additional  validation  in  Fig.  3.  The  accuracy
of  the  model  is  not  perfect,  and  simulated  yields  were  also  found
be  sensitive  to  phenology  simulation,  shifting  the  period  with  peak
yield  loss  due  to  cold  sterility  by  10–20  days.  Continued  work  on
model  improvement  and  collection  of  accurate  input  and  validation
data  is  needed.  However,  approximate  accuracy  and  the  absence  of
distorting  bias  can  be  a  sufﬁcient  condition  to  answer  speciﬁc  ques-
tions.  Within  the  framework  of  the  present  hypotheses  and  factors,
a  perfect  model  would  not  have  changed  the  conclusions.

4.4.  Observed  vs  optimised  sowing  dates

Our  simulations  showed  yield  gains  of  about  1  t/ha  (+12  to  +16%)
when  sowing  one  to  two   months  earlier  than  farmers  do  now.
Discrepancies  between  model  optimised  sowing  dates  and  actual
farmers’  sowing  dates  indicate  the  presence  of  third  factors  that
were  not  considered,  and  indicate  that  the  model’s  boundaries  need
to  be  extended,  e.g.  through  participatory  research  on  farmers’  deci-
sion  criteria.

During  a  recent  ﬁeld  visit  to  the  study  area  (van  Oort  and  Sow,  29
April  2016)  we  spoke  with  farmers  and  obtained  some  cues  on  why
farmers  would  sow  later  than  optimal  according  to  the  model  pre-
sented  here.  Farmers  told  us  that  in  recent  years  tomato  and  onion
are  more  proﬁtable  than  rice,  so  cultivation  of  these  vegetables  gets
priority  over  timely  sowing  of  rice.  They  told  us  irrigation  is  expen-
sive,  thus  increasing  costs  and  risk  when  sowing  rice  before  the
start  of  the  wet  season,  as  our  model  suggests.  For  the  same  rea-
son,  many  farmers  prefer  short  duration  Sahel  108  over  medium
duration  varieties.  According  to  farmers,  the  yield  gain  of  medium
duration  varieties  is  insufﬁcient  to  offset  the  extra  costs  of  irriga-
tion.  Our  data  conﬁrm  this  perception:  in  Table  3  simulations  1
and  2  show  that  going  from  short  to  medium  duration  variety  the

180 

P.A.J.  van  Oort  et  al.  /  Europ.  J.  Agronomy  80  (2016)  168–181

yield  increases  from  7.9  to  8.8  t/ha  (+10%)  while  duration  increases
from  119  to  149  days  (+25%).  It  shows  that  the  marginal  cost  of
increased  time  (which  will  be  strongly  correlated  with  irrigation
water  needs)  is  larger  than  the  marginal  yield  increase.  We   found
higher  marginal  costs  than  marginal  yield  gains  in  all  comparisons
between  short  and  medium  duration  varieties  in  Tables  2  and  3.
Lastly,  farmers  also  mentioned  the  already  well  known  constraints
of  delayed  planting  due  to  lack  of  seed,  credit,  machinery  and  con-
straints  of  decisions  at  the  scheme  level  on  when  to  irrigate  (Poussin
et  al.,  2006;  Poussin  et  al.,  2005;  Tanaka  et  al.,  2015).  This  anecdotal
experience  highlights  the  limitations  of  sowing  date  optimisation
for  rice  only  and  highlights  the  need  for  broader  socio-economic
analysis  including  all  crops  in  the  rotation,  not  only  rice.

4.5.  Carry-over  effects

Our  model  was  selective  in  the  choice  of  process  considered  in
evaluating  cropping  calendars.  One  simpliﬁcation  was  the  absence
of  environmental  carry-over  effects  from  one  crop  to  the  next.
Such  effects  are  common  in  rainfed  systems  where  water  uptake
of  one  crop  affects  initial  soil  moisture  of  the  following  crop.  In
irrigated  systems,  this  carry-over  effect  can  be  ignored  as  we   sim-
ply  assume  that  always  enough  water  is  available.  For  this  reason,
increasing  cropping  intensity  is  often  more  promising  in  irrigated
systems  than  in  rainfed  systems.  Likewise,  we  chose  to  ignore
carry-over  effects  of  soil  nutrients  as  we  assumed  these  would  be
supplemented  with  fertiliser.  In  systems  where  carry-over  effects
of  water  and  nutrients  play  an  important  role  it  is  better  to  use
models  speciﬁcally  designed  for  that  purpose,  using  models  such  as
APSIM  and  DSSAT,  for  example  see  Singh  et  al.  (2015a);  Singh  et  al.
(2015b);  (Gaydon  et  al.,  2012a;  Gaydon  et  al.,  2012b).  A  third  impor-
tant  carry-over  effect  is  that  of  the  build-up  of  pests  and  diseases.
Such  carry-over  effects  are  less  common  in  continuous  irrigated
rice  systems  (Dobermann  et  al.,  2000)  in  comparison  with  more
vulnerable  vegetable  systems.  In  systems  where  carry-over  effects
of  build-up  of  pests  and  diseases  play  an  important  role  it  is  better
to  use  models  that  can  simulate  these  effects,  such  as  ROTAT  and
PermVeg  Dogliotti  et  al.  (2003);  (Huong  et  al.,  2014;  Van  Den  Berg
and  Rossing,  2005;  Van  Den  Berg  et  al.,  2006).

4.6.  Limitations  and  extensions

This  paper  builds  on  previous  works  reported  in  (Miezan  et  al.,
1997)  and  knowledge  gaps  identiﬁed  by  (Matlon,  1997).  A  previ-
ous  similar  study  systematically  assessed  options  for  rice  single  and
double  cropping  Dingkuhn  (1995)  but  did  not  include  vegetable
crops,  did  not  include  a  comparison  between  ultra-short,  short  and
medium  duration  varieties  and  did  not  explicitly  quantify  ﬂexibil-
ity.  These  are  important  factors  in  farmers’  decision  making.  Since
these  works  in  the  mid   1990s,  there  have  been  more  studies  into  the
farmers’  perspective  and  causes  of  yield  gaps,  and  rice  models  have
been  improved.  The  current  study  builds  on  that  work.  Still,  there
are  three  important  limitations  not  addressed  in  this  paper  which
we  hope  to  address  in  follow-up  studies.  Firstly,  we  did  not  quan-
tify  climate  change  effects.  Secondly,  we  lacked  data  on  vegetables
in  the  study  area.  There  is  a  large  imbalance  between  rice  and  veg-
etables  in  terms  of  available  data  and  models  for  the  study  area,
probably  because  there  is  a  rice  research  institute  and  not  a  veg-
etable  research  institute  present  in  the  study  region.  The  analyses
presented  in  this  paper  show  the  potential  importance  of  veg-
etables  in  local,  intensiﬁed,  rice-based  cropping  systems.  Thirdly,
we  did  not  include  an  economic  evaluation  of  the  intensiﬁcation
options.  This,  as  well  as  considering  implications  of  climate  change
for  rice-based  cropping  systems,  warrants  follow-up  studies.

5.  Conclusions

A  GxExM  cropping  calendar  optimisation  model  was  presented.
Optimisation  included  genetic  (G)  traits  (crop  duration  and  cold
tolerance)  and  management  (M)   decisions  (sowing  dates,  time
between  crops)  in  interaction  and  in  an  environment  (E)  with
extreme  temperatures.  The  model  optimises  cropping  calendars
of  rice  single,  double  and  triple  crops.  Next  to  rice  a  second  (veg-
etable)  crop  was  included  in  a  rudimentary  manner  by  blocking
part  of  the  year  for  vegetable  cropping.  The  model  also  quantiﬁed
how  much  ﬂexibility  there  was   in  the  crop  rotations  and  showed
that  a  clear  trade-off  exists  between  ﬂexibility  and  total  yield.  The
model  was   applied  to  the  middle  valley  of  the  Senegal  River.  In  this
site,  farmers  already  practice  double  cropping.  The  value  of  a  mod-
elling  exercise  such  as  presented  here  is  that  it  allows  for  simulating
probable  yield  gains  that  arise  from  changes  in  planting  dates,  new
cold  or  heat  tolerant  varieties  and  choices  between  duration  types.
Triple  cropping  is  not  practiced  and  it  was   unclear  to  date  whether
it  would  be  possible.  Our  analysis  showed  that  it  is  almost  impos-
sible  because  calendar  ﬂexibility  would  be  too  small.  An  expansion
of  rice  cultivated  area  is  expected  in  the  coming  decades.  For  sites
newly  brought  into  cultivation  in  the  region,  the  CCC  model  devel-
oped  here  can  be  used  to  explore  which  rice-based  rotations  would
be  viable.
