Process-based agricultural simulation models are eﬀective tools which can be applied to assess the potential
impact of climate change and agronomic practices on yield and nutrient cycling. This study investigates the
eﬀects of climate change and fertilization on yield, nitrogen (N) contribution eﬃciency (the percentage of re-
mobilized N from the vegetative material in grains out of total N content in grains at harvest, (ANCE)), N loss to
water and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) – rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping
system in southern China, using the SPACSYS (v6.0) model. The model was ﬁrst evaluated using crop production
and N accumulation data from three-year ﬁeld experiments, and then applied to simulate production and N
processes under three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios for the wheat-rice cropping region,
with projections for the years 2020 to 2100. Results indicated that N management as well as shifting sowing or
transplantation dates could greatly mitigate the yield losses and N contribution eﬃciency (ANCE) reduction in
the winter wheat-rice rotation system. Delaying sowing dates of wheat and transplanting rice earlier could
reduce N leaching losses. Unexpectedly, climate change indirectly increased N2O emissions, showing signiﬁcant
variation depending on the interaction with high N fertilization for rice pre-anthesis, indicating that emissions
can be limited by restricting fertilizer application. Changing growing season start dates, along with im-
plementing appropriate N management practice is a potential way to increase resilience to climate change in the
wheat-rice cropping system of China.

1. Introduction

Sustainable production of both wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice
(Oryza sativa L.) continues to be challenging because of on-going in-
crease in demand (Porter et al., 2014). With climate change, increased
overall climatic variability, (e.g., change in frequency, intensity, timing
and duration of events), occurs, which adversely aﬀects food security in
developing countries where rice is mainly grown (Gupta and
Nair, 2012; Lal, 2019; Arunrat et al., 2020). Higher seasonal mean
temperatures over the ﬂowering and grain-ﬁlling periods threaten
wheat growth and production (Rashid et al., 2018; Asseng et al., 2019).
Frequent and high intensity of rainfall events accelerate nitrogen (N)
losses
through surface runoﬀ and leaching
(Wang and Li, 2019). In addition, it has been suggested that high

to the environment

temperatures would indirectly increase N loss through N2O emissions
(Xiao et al., 2019).

Crop yields have potential to vary greatly in the future because of
climate change, being aﬀected by factors such as an increase in tem-
perature, uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation and reduced
incident solar radiation (Liu et al., 2019; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019).
Both ﬁeld and controlled experiments suggest that high temperatures
increase transpiration, decrease water use eﬃciency, and further lower
leaf assimilation by winter wheat (Rashid et al., 2018). Atmospheric
CO2 fertilization eﬀects on crop yields are likely to reduce because of
increasing temperature and drought over the growing season (Jin et al.,
2018). Predicted ﬂuctuations in temperature and precipitation lead to
acceleration of the growth and development of cereal crops and in-
crease in water demand, which ultimately has an important impact on

crop production (Kim et al., 2013; Tao et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2020).
Accumulation of N in plants at the vegetative stage and its redis-
tribution to the economically valuable organs (expressed, in this study,
as accumulated N contribution eﬃciency, ANCE) at the reproductive
stage, which is essential to cereal crop yield and quality, are known to
be aﬀected by agronomic practices and weather conditions (Wei et al.,
2008). The majority of the N in grains of winter wheat is translocated
from leaves and stems, where N accumulates before anthesis
(Mackown et al., 1992; Bertheloot et al., 2008). Previous studies sug-
gest that this source accounts for 60 – 92% of the N accumulated in
grain at harvest, and the ability of a plant to accumulate N as well as its
quantity are mainly dependent on indigenous soil nutrient supply, N
fertilization rates and growing conditions over the vegetative period as
well as genotype (Rodgers and Barneix, 1988; Papakosta and
Gagianas, 1991; Barbottin et al., 2005). Fertilizer application increases
nutrient uptake and utilization by aﬀecting the capacity of the rhizo-
sphere to supply nutrients and moisture to plant roots (Yang et al.,
2004). However, higher N fertilization rates during the vegetative stage
cause a decrease in ANCE as the resulting higher level of N availability
during the reproductive stage renders N remobilization unnecessary
(Cox et al., 1986; Barbottin et al., 2005). Moreover, water stress, ele-
vated CO2 and high temperature signiﬁcantly aﬀect N uptake, which
decreases N translocation to economic organs before anthesis
(Halloran, 1981; Macabuhay, 2016).

Process-based modeling is an eﬀective tool to assess the impacts of
climate change and agronomic practices not only on yield and N uptake
but also nutrient cycling. The SPACSYS model is able to simulate crop
growth and development, soil carbon (C), N and phosphorus (P) cy-
cling, water redistribution and heat transformation (Wu et al., 2007,
2015; Wu, 2019). In this study, the model was calibrated and validated
using the results of our ﬁeld experiments on a winter wheat-rice rota-
tion, then the validated model was run for the baseline and three cli-
mate change scenarios along with various agronomic practices. The
objectives are to: 1) quantitatively predict and evaluate the impacts of
climate change on grain yield, ANCE, N losses in water and N2O
emissions in the typical cropping system in southern China using the
SPACSYS model, and 2) to suggest adaptation strategies to oﬀset the
negative impacts of the change.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study site and experimental design

A ﬁeld experiment involving a winter wheat-rice cropping system
was conducted at a site at Jingshan (112°48′54″E, 30°54′14″N) in the
middle of the Yangtze river basin in China from 2015 to 2018. The
experimental site has a typical subtropical monsoon climate and soil
type for the region. The soil is classiﬁed as a yellow-brown soil in the
Chinese soil classiﬁcation, equivalent to Haplic Luvisols in the USDA Soil
Taxonomy. Soil physical-chemical properties at the beginning of the
experiment are given in Table 1.

Winter wheat was rainfed, while rice was irrigated using an average
of 505 mm throughout the growing season. Treatments included no N
fertilizer input (N0) and three urea application rates (wheat: 120, 150
and 180 kg N ha−1, and rice: 150, 180 and 210 kg N ha−1), with 70% of

Table 1

the N delivered in basal fertilizer and 30% as topdressing applied at the
tiller stage. All the treatments received the same amount of calcium
superphosphate (75 P2O5 kg ha−1) and potassium chloride (120 K2O kg
ha−1) in the form of basal fertilizer over a crop growing season. Local
cultivars (E'mai596 for wheat and Huanghuazhan for rice), and ﬁeld
management practices including tillage, weed and pest control were
adopted. Plots were tilled before the crop was sown or transplanted
using a ﬁeld cultivator to a depth of 10–15 cm for seed bed preparation.
In a plot, winter wheat was sown in early November and harvested in
late May and then rice was transplanted in mid-June and harvested in
late September. Each treatment was replicated three times. The plots
were arranged in a randomized complete block design. The plot size
was 5 m × 8 m for both rice and wheat.

2.2. Plant sampling and analyses

The following datasets were used to evaluate the resultant simula-
tions for wheat and rice: grain yield at maturity, total aboveground dry
matter at diﬀerent times, N accumulation in grain and biomass. The dry
matter was collected and dried during key growing stages – tillering,
booting, grain ﬁlling and maturity for both wheat and rice. Grain yields
were determined by harvesting the whole plot area and weighing all the
grain in parallel to the harvesting operation. Plant samples were wa-
shed thoroughly with deionized water to remove any soil contamina-
tion. The material was pre-dried for 1 h at 105 °C followed by oven
drying at 80 °C to constant weight. After dry weight determination,
dried samples were ground to a powder before N concentration was
determined using an elemental analyzer (Vario Max CN, Elemetar
Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany). Grain and above ground N
uptake were calculated by multiplying N concentration by grain or
above-ground dry matter production, respectively.

2.3. Model description

A detailed description of the ﬁeld-scale, daily time step and process-
based simulation model, SPACSYS, has been published previously
(Wu et al., 2007; 2011; 2015; 2019). Soil N cycling including N2O
emissions has been calibrated and validated in various environmental
conditions including Chinese climates and soil types (Bingham and
Wu, 2011; Wu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018), which indicated that the
model could generate reasonable N dynamics for our study. Thus, only
a brief summary of recently integrated processes that are closely related
to this study are presented here. A biochemical Farquhar-based model
(Yin et al., 2009; Yin and Struik, 2017) to estimate the leaf photo-
synthesis rate was introduced to replace the algorithm previously used.
Transplant shock was quantiﬁed as a function of the seedling age ( °C d)
at transplanting.

2.4. Weather data and climate change scenarios

Historic weather data for Jingshan were downloaded from the
National Meteorological Information Center (http://data.cma.cn). To
predict the impacts of climate change on grain yield and ANCE of the
wheat-rice system in the area between 2020 and 2100, the datasets for
four climate scenarios – Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)

2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Van Vuuren et al., 2011) were ex-
tracted from the bias corrected HadGEM2-ES model (0.5 × 0.5°)
(ISIMIP, www.isimip.org, Collins et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2011;
Arneth et al., 2017) for the study site. Average values and variations in
precipitation, temperature and global radiation over the period for each
climate scenario (2020–2100) and the baseline (1980–2018) are given
in Table 2 and Fig. S1. As there were no great diﬀerences in tempera-
ture and solar radiation between RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, we did not run
simulations under RCP6.0. The atmospheric CO2 concentration was set
to 380 ppm initially and increased progressively to 425.4, 538.1 and
923.7 ppm for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in 2100, respectively.

2.5. Model calibration, validation and prediction

The parameters related to soil water redistribution and heat trans-
formation were based on previous studies (Bingham and Wu, 2011;
Wu et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2018), whilst those relating to soil C and N
cycling, plant photosynthesis, development and N translocation were
determined through calibration (Table S1 and S2). The model was ca-
librated with the data collected from the ﬁrst year of the experiment
(2016 for wheat and 2017 for rice) using the trial and error method and
the Multi-Objective Shuﬄed Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm
(Vrugt et al., 2003) implemented within the model. The model was then
validated using the remaining data collected during the experiment.

To estimate the impacts of climate change on the cropping system,
the model was run for each climate scenario with the same ﬁeld man-
agement practices, cultivars and initial values of C, N, water and tem-
peratures in the soil proﬁle as those in the ﬁeld experiment. However,
sowing dates for winter wheat and transplanting dates for rice were
automatically determined by the model in which an algorithm was
implemented. The sowing date was set when the 5-day rolling average
daily air temperature is below the temperature for germination plus
2 °C in the autumn (Wu, 2019). To determine transplanting dates, the
model was run once to determine proper sowing dates in spring based
on the suitable temperature for rice germination. When simulated ac-
cumulated temperatures reach the required accumulated temperatures
for transplanting, the date was treated as a transplanting date. Both
winter wheat and rice were harvested when they reached physiological
maturity. The changes in transplanting and sowing dates under various
climate scenarios compared with the dates in the ﬁeld experiment are
given in Fig. S2.

2.6. Data analysis

ANCE was calculated following Xie et al. (2007).

where NAanthesis and NAmaturity are N contents (kg N ha−1) in stems and
leaves at anthesis and maturity, respectively; and NAgrain is N content in
grains at maturity.

The following statistical indices were used to assess model perfor-
mance when the SPACSYS model was calibrated and validated: 1) the

3

coeﬃcient of determination (CD, the closer to 1, the better), which
describes the goodness of ﬁt between simulated and measured data; 2)
the root mean squared error (RMSE), which reﬂects the average size of
error between simulated and measured data; 3) modeling eﬃciency
(EF, the closer to 1, the better), which quantiﬁes the accuracy and
conﬁdence of simulation; 4) the correlation coeﬃcient (r), which tests
the degree of association between simulated and measured data; and 5)
the relative error (RE), which represents the total diﬀerence between
simulated and measured data. These diagnostics are a subset of that
proposed by Smith et al. (1997) for evaluating process-based models.
For the result of the predicted process between 2020 and 2100, two-
way ANOVA and Tukey's honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence (HSD) (** for P
< 0.01; * for P < 0.05) were used to test the signiﬁcance of the eﬀects
of N fertilizer treatments and climate change scenarios on average va-
lues of grain yields, ANCE, N losses and residual N of winter wheat and
rice, respectively. The analyses were conducted in SPSS 20.0 (SPSS,
Inc., 2011, Chicago, USA).

3. Results

3.1. Model calibration and validation

The SPACSYS model is able to adequately simulate the dynamics of
crop growth and yields in the wheat and rice cropping system (Fig. 1,
Table 3), and the patterns and magnitude of the modelled dry matter
accumulation agreed well with the observed data for each treatment
(Fig. S3). The observed values of wheat biomass ranged from 2340 to
8520 kg ha−1 and the range of simulated values was from 2780 to
8590 kg ha−1; the observed rice biomass ranged between 1460 and
13,930 kg ha−1 whilst the simulated values were in the range 2190 to
13,890 kg ha−1.

The overall accuracy of the model's performance is shown in
Table 3, based on the statistical indices for calibration and validation.
For instance, the average EF for simulated and observed values of the
model components for wheat and rice were 0.72 and 0.77, respectively,
with 9.2% and 9.6% for RMSE, 0.98 and 1.81 for CD, and 0.89 and 2.82
for RE. For validation the values were 0.69 and 0.78, with 15.6% and
10.2% for RMSE, 0.95 and 1.9 for CD, and −2.54 and −0.02 for RE. In
addition, there was a statistically signiﬁcant linear regression between
the observed and simulated values, and R2 (the variation of observation
can be explain by simulated data using a linear regression.) ranged from
0.71 to 0.86 and 0.69 to 0.93 (P < 0.05) for the model components for
wheat and rice, respectively (Fig. 1). Although the statistical tests va-
lidated the model and indicated good calibration, discrepancies re-
mained between simulated and observed data. Simulated aboveground
N content for winter wheat was overestimated by 22.2%, and the
averages of simulated and observed values were 71.3 kg ha−1 and
58.3 kg ha−1, respectively (Fig. 1g).

3.2. Yield variations

The model revealed a decline in average yields for both winter
wheat and rice under the three RCP scenarios across the fertilization

Fig. 2. Boxplots summarizing variation in wheat (a) and rice (b) grain yield from the baseline and three climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)
under diﬀerent N treatments between 2020 and 2100. For each boxplot, the central mark is the median, the red square indicates the mean value, the edges of the box
are the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers extend to the extreme data points not considered to be outliers. Extreme events are indicated by both minimum
and maximum values (ﬁlled circles). Diﬀerent lowercase letters represent signiﬁcant diﬀerences (P < 0.05) under diﬀerent climate scenarios in each individual N
treatment. Diﬀerent capital letters represent signiﬁcant diﬀerences (P < 0.05) between the diﬀerent N treatments under the three climate scenarios. (For inter-
pretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

treatments compared with the baseline, and the risk of yield loss in-
creased signiﬁcantly, amounting to 8.7% and 18.6% for wheat and for
rice, respectively under the RCP8.5 scenario (Fig. 2 and Table S3). The
lowest average grain yields for wheat (1937 kg ha−1) and rice (5508 kg
ha−1) among the N treatments were found under RCP8.5. Among the
climate change scenarios, the model suggests that yield losses could be
signiﬁcantly alleviated by fertilization and shifting sowing or trans-
planting dates. For example, the grain yield of winter wheat could in-
crease 210 kg ha−1 between the N180 and N150 treatments (Fig. 2a)
while rice yield could increase by 440 kg ha−1 between the N210 and
N180 treatments (Fig. 2b) under RCP8.5. Delaying the sowing date for
wheat could increase grain yield by the average of 5% under the N150
treatment (Fig. 6b) while rice yield with an earlier transplanting date
signiﬁcantly increased by 10.4% under RCP 8.5 (Fig. 6c, P < 0.05).

3.3. Climate change and fertilization impacts on ANCE

The contribution of accumulated aboveground N before anthesis to
the N content in grains of both winter wheat and rice was signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by climate change and N management (Fig. 3, Table S3). The
average ANCE for all the climate scenarios and N treatments varied
between 50 and 55% for winter wheat and from 20 to 40% for rice. For
all the N treatments, the ANCE for winter wheat decreased as follows:

RCP8.5 < RCP4.5 < RCP2.6 < Baseline, but for rice the order was
followed by: RCP2.6 < RCP4.5 < RCP8.5 < Baseline. The average
values of ANCE for both crops were signiﬁcantly enhanced with in-
creasing N application rate under each individual climate scenario (P <
0.05).

3.4. Nitrogen losses in water

Simulated N losses in water (through leaching and surface runoﬀ)
over the vegetative and reproductive periods for each crop growing
season are shown in Fig. 4. The losses for winter wheat over each of the
periods increased signiﬁcantly with increasing N application rate under
the baseline and each climate scenario (Fig. 4a and 4b, P < 0.05).
Compared with the baseline, N losses in water over the vegetative and
reproductive stages were −15.3 and 37.5% for wheat, and 56.7 and
45.2% for rice, respectively (Fig. 4). Increasing N fertilization had no
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the losses over the whole growing period for rice
but there was a slight, non-signiﬁcant, increase (Fig. 4c and 4d, P >
0.05). Furthermore, N losses over the vegetative stage for rice ac-
counted for over 60% of the total over the whole season. For all ferti-
lization treatments, N losses over the reproductive stage in rice and
winter wheat were signiﬁcantly increased under RCP2.6 and 8.5 com-
pared with the baseline (Fig. 4b and 4d, P < 0.05). For all the climate

than those under the baseline, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, by 44.3%, 52.0%
and 62.6%, respectively.

3.5. N2O emissions

Nitrogen addition and climate change signiﬁcantly increased N2O
emissions before anthesis (Fig. 5, Table S3). N2O emissions during the
vegetative stage for wheat and rice increased signiﬁcantly with in-
creasing N application rates (Fig. 5a and 5c, P < 0.05), while average
emission rates over the reproductive stage for crops could be negligible
under the baseline and all three RCP scenarios (Fig. 5b and 5d). For all
the fertilization treatments, N2O emissions during the vegetative period
for winter wheat under RCP2.6 increased by 18.4 ∼ 54.4% compared
with the baseline and the other climate change scenarios but the dif-
ference was not statistically signiﬁcant. However, the emissions in the

4.1. Model performance

Previous studies have reported that SPACSYS can accurately simu-
late yields and N uptake of wheat and maize under various N man-
agement practices in other areas (Zhang et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2017).
Bingham and Wu (2011) used SPACSYS to predict aboveground bio-
mass of winter wheat in the UK (24% for the average RMSE and 0.91 for
the average r). Our study proved that the new version of the model is
capable of simulating N accumulation and redistribution in plants and
rice growth in paddy soils and can successfully predict aboveground

biomass and N accumulation and grain yield. The calibration and va-
lidation suggest that the model is able to predict aboveground biomass
and N content and grain yields responding to diﬀerent environmental
conditions and fertilizer application rates. Therefore, it can provide
reliable predictions for various climate change scenarios. However, the
model still exhibited discrepancies compared with real observations.
This may be because of 1) simpliﬁcation processes in the model; 2) the
assumptions related to the impacts of pests, pathogens, diseases and
weeds on crop growth; and 3) measurement errors. Indeed, during
model development, N translocation to grain chaﬀ during the re-
productive stage was simpliﬁed; this caused the aboveground N content
in the simulation to be overestimated by 23.7% in winter wheat and
14.1% in rice compared to actual observations (Fig. 1g and 1h).

climate

and upland

soil

including Chinese

The SPACSYS model has been validated in various environmental
conditions
type
(Bingham and Wu, 2011; Wu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018). Because
of the original design of the described ﬁeld experiment, it is impossible
to validate the N2O emissions using the existing experimental data.
More frequent soil drying-rewetting cycling in paddy soils could aﬀect
processes of mineralization, nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation in N cy-
cling (Luster et al., 2014). Previous simulations on nutrient cycling in
paddy soils with the SPACSYS model suggested that N2O emissions are
reasonably estimated (Wu and Wu, 2020, unpublished). Furthermore,
the average of simulated annual N2O emissions under the baseline is
within the reporting range for the same cropping system with a similar
climate (Kou et al., 2015; Lan et al., 2020). Therefore, to acquire reli-
able estimation on the emission in paddy soils, more validations should
be made in the future.

4.2. Nitrogen loss under diﬀerent climate change scenarios

Our simulations indicated that climate change will have negative
impacts on the environment in terms of N emitted from soils in the
wheat-rice rotation cropping system in China. This is in agreement with
previous studies that focused on upland cropping systems (Xue et al.,
2014; Øygarden et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2019). The abundant rainfall
over the growing period may trigger considerable N losses via surface
runoﬀ and leaching (Xie et al., 2019). N losses in water over the whole
growing season under the diﬀerent RCP scenarios increased for each
treatment in the order: RCP2.6 > RCP8.5 > Baseline > RCP4.5 for
wheat and Baseline > RCP2.6 > RCP4.5 > RCP8.5 for rice. This may

7

be because the conditions result in a later sowing date and earlier
transplantation date, meaning that the intensity and distribution of
rainfall shifted between wheat and rice compared with ﬁxed sowing or
transplantation dates (Fig. S6–8). Accordingly, the average accumu-
lated precipitation under the diﬀerent climate scenarios at pre-anthesis
and post-anthesis were −7.2 and 37.8% for wheat, and 17.6 and 21.7%
for rice, respectively (Fig. 4, S4j, k and S5j, k). In addition, with in-
creased N fertilization rates, application tended to occur before an-
thesis, and N losses via surface runoﬀ and leaching occurred when large
amounts of N application coincided with heavy precipitation
(Liang et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2019). We found that N loss over the
vegetative and reproductive stages with application of 180 kg N ha−1
for wheat increased by 19.3% compared with 150 kg N ha−1 – a sta-
tistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerence – whilst with an application of 180 kg
N ha−1 to rice the increase was only 3% compared with 150 kg N ha−1.
Therefore, by adopting appropriate rates of N application under the
prevailing climate conditions, losses of N can be minimized.

For N losses through N2O emissions, the highest cumulative values
for the wheat and rice cropping system were found in the high N
treatment during pre-anthesis under the three RCP scenarios (Fig. 5,
S11 and S12). The application of chemical fertilizer (e.g. urea) provides
suﬃcient substrate (e.g. NH4+- N) to activate nitriﬁcation in the soil,
and also provides a large amount of substrate for denitriﬁcation, which
greatly increases the risk of N2O emissions from agricultural systems
(Stein, 2011; Shang et al., 2019). Although the impacts of climate
change were not the dominant factor aﬀecting N2O emissions from
cropland, high levels of N fertilizer application (e.g. 210 kg N ha−1 for
rice) interacted with speciﬁc climate scenarios, resulting in higher N2O
emissions (i.e. RCP4.5: 1.9 kg N ha−1) and N losses to the environment
emissions (i.e. RCP8.5: 3.8 kg N ha−1) (Fig. 5 and S12, Table S3). This
may be because climate change is associated with reduced precipitation
and relatively high temperatures, which would improve soil physical
conditions for the microbial activity associated with nitriﬁcation and
denitriﬁcation, and further promote N2O production because of the
ready supply of N. This would be particularly the case in anaerobic
environments such as paddy soil (Table 2, Fig. 5b and S5, Qin et al.,
2019).

Residual fertilizer N could aﬀect succeeding crop growth and N
losses to environment (Xu et al., 2015). In our simulations, the amount
of residual fertilizer N from the wheat season was 21 ∼28% higher than
that from the rice season under the diﬀerent RCP scenarios (Fig. 7,

Table S3, P < 0.05), which would enhance grain yield and lead to an
increase in N losses via N2O emissions over the succeeding rice season
(Fig. 2 and 5, Jiang et al., 2020). Unused N applied during the wheat
season could be temporally ﬁxed by microbes (Bristow et al., 1987) and
subsequently released in the succeeding rice season through re-

mineralization, which can increase substrate for the nitriﬁcation and
denitriﬁcation (Ferchaud et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2020).

4.3. Climate change and adaptation strategies

Predicted yields under the three RCP scenarios declined (Fig. 2, 3,
S9, S10 and Table 2). Wheat and rice yields under RCP scenarios may
decrease signiﬁcantly, averaging 4.7% and 10.6% less, respectively
compared with baseline. This is in agreement with a previous study
which reported that average yield across the major crops in Asia could
decline by 14.0% (Porter et al., 2019). An increase in temperature
under RCP8.5 would shorten the growing season and delay wheat
sowing into the cold and dry season when there are low temperatures,
thus inducing vernalization, which would represent an adaptation to
future climate warming. With respect to rice yield under the various
climate change scenarios, the average solar radiation at increasingly
later transplantation dates would be 4.2% higher during the re-
productive stage compared with the baseline. This would enhance the
radiation use eﬃciency during the grain-ﬁlling stage and further de-
crease the yield loss, although heat stress caused by the higher tem-
peratures would simultaneously decrease the yield (Fig. S5k, Xing et al.,
2017; Ali et al., 2019). Our simulation results also suggest that average
wheat and rice ANCE during the vegetative stage under the RCP sce-
narios signiﬁcantly decreased, by an average of 9.4% and 11.9%, re-
spectively, compared with the baseline (Fig. 3). Previous studies have
demonstrated the environmental changes, such as an increase in tem-
perature and elevated CO2 concentrations, adversely aﬀect nutrient
mobilization to leaves or economic organs (Fangmeier et al., 1999;
Maillard et al., 2015). Additionally, for an 80-year simulation, the ex-
treme low grain yield for wheat (i.e. 100 and 156 kg ha−1 for 2023 and
2054, respectively) occurred in RCP4.5 scenario. This may be because
low-temperature (i.e. < 2 °C) around the jointing and booting stage
resulted in spring frost, which has negative eﬀects on crop growth and
grain yield (Fig. S4d and S9, Liu et al., 2020).

Here, we developed an integrated SPACSYS management approach
to adapt to climate change factors (including solar radiation, tem-
perature, precipitation, and CO2 concentration), allowing the model to
determine crop sowing and transplantation dates in order to maximize
the use of resources and periods with favourable temperatures (Fig. 6a).
Our simulations suggest that the average yield could be higher than that
with ﬁxed sowing or transplantation dates under each climate scenario
(Fig. 6b-c), with delayed sowing dates for winter wheat and earlier
transplantation dates for rice (Fig. 6d and e). Crop yields under such an
adaptive strategy increased by 3.8 and 4.8% for wheat and rice, re-
spectively, on average among all the climate scenarios. Compared with
the yields under the baseline, those under the projected scenarios are
still lower (Fig. 2a and b) partly because of shorter growing seasons
(Fig. 6f and g) and thus reduced photosynthesis and grain-ﬁlling per-
iods, as conﬁrmed by a previous study (Zhao et al., 2015). For wheat
under RCP4.5, grain yield was projected to be slightly lower with ﬁxed
date, possibly because of a slight increase in radiation (0.5%) and
precipitation (14.4%) during the prolonged growing season compared
with delayed wheat sowing and earlier rice transplantation (Fig. 6f and
S5).

The adaptive strategy suggested by the model could also eﬀectively
reduce N losses in water and through gaseous emissions under climate
change scenarios by an average of 5.4% and 5.8% in the wheat-rice
rotation system (Fig. S7 and S8). N fertilization (150 kg N ha−1 for
wheat and 180 kg N ha−1 for rice) signiﬁcantly increased yield (13%
for wheat and 7% for rice) and ANCE (3% for wheat and 7% for rice)
compared with the 120 kg N ha−1 for wheat or 150 kg N ha−1 for rice,
respectively. However, higher N fertilization (e.g. 180 kg N ha−1 for
wheat and 210 kg N ha−1 for rice) increased the amount and the
probability of high N load events through surface runoﬀ and emissions
in the wheat-rice rotation system, as found in previous studies (Fig. 4,
Zhang et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2019). Thus, suitable fertilization and
changing sowing or transplantation dates could be optimized to ﬁt fu-
ture climate change, resulting in reduced N loss and alleviation of yield
loss in the wheat-rice rotation system. It is essential to increase crop N

use eﬃciency and ANCE over the vegetative period and reduce N losses
from farmland to the environment as climate change occurs
(Venterea et al., 2012). In addition, combined with advances in crop
simulation models, breeding technology and genetic improvement, it is
necessary to develop new wheat and rice cultivars that deliver high
ANCE before anthesis, are temperature tolerant and prolong the dura-
tion of both wheat and rice in order to tackle the challenge of climate
change.

Conclusion

Simulation results based on three climate change scenarios showed
that N management and shifting sowing or transplantation dates could
greatly mitigate the yield losses and ANCE reduction in the winter
wheat-rice rotation system. Delaying sowing dates of winter wheat and
advancing transplantation dates of rice in the future could reduce N
losses via leaching and surface runoﬀ. However, combined higher fer-
tilizer application rates (180 kg N ha−1 for wheat and 210 kg N ha−1
for rice) and climate change scenarios in the model signiﬁcantly in-
creased N losses to the environment. Careful N management practices
(150 kg N ha−1 for wheat and 180 kg N ha−1 for rice) can eﬀectively
reduce N pollution and maintain a higher level of crop yields in the
future. Changing commencement of growing seasons along with proper
N management practices have the potential to increase resilience of
agricultural systems to climate change.
