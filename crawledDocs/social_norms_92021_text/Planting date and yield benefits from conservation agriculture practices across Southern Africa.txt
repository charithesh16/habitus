Managing production risks under high rainfall variability remains a research priority in Southern Africa. In this
region, conservation agriculture (CA) has been promoted as useful set of principles that could improve farmers'
resilience to climate variability and change. However, matching practices to agro-ecological and farmers' socio-
economic conditions remain contentious. Here we combine empirical data and results from a cropping system
model to quantify beneﬁts and trade-offs, in terms of sowing opportunity, yield, and yield variability, from
adopting CA practices. We hypothesized that CA practices would require less labour, allow farmers to plant ear-
lier, at times closer to optimum planting times and consequently result in higher maize yields.
We tested the hypothesis using available household labour and the outputs from a cropping systems model
(DSSAT) run for six locations in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Thirty years of climate records and soil
characterisations were available for each site. Modelled CA practices included, a basin planting system prepared
early during winter (CA-Basins early); a basin planting system prepared late and at the onset of the rains (CA-ba-
sins late); an animal draught direct seeder e.g. using a Fitarelli animal traction planter (CA-Direct seed); an ani-
mal traction ripper (CA-Ripper); and a dibble stick manual planting system (CA-Dibble). Check conventional
cropping systems included conventional mouldboard ploughing prepared early (CMP-early), and late (CMP-
late), which mimicked farmers having early or late access to draft power, respectively.
Simulated results showed that CA-Ripper, CA-Direct seeding and CA-Basins improved timeliness of operations
and enabled earlier planting across all locations compared to conventional systems. Mechanized CA systems po-
tentially offered farmers ﬂexibility on when to plant. However, timely planting of CA systems did not translate
into higher yields when carried out during periods of high rainfall variability. Yield beneﬁts of early plantings
in CA were only apparent in Zimbabwe. Rainfall patterns showed a shift of 0.28 and 0.39 days yr−1 in planting
dates at Chitala and Chitedze, over the simulated 30 years. However, this was not evident at the other four loca-
tions. Optimum planting dates established for the six locations were 5th to 27th December for Malawi; 26th De-
cember to 7th January for Mozambique; and 4th to 7th December for Zimbabwe. For each location, planting
maize close to the optimum period resulted in higher yields, irrespective of cropping system. Signiﬁcantly
(P b 0.05) lower yield variability values i.e. 25% compared to 32 and 36%, were observed for optimum date plant-
ings. Model generated optimum planting dates could be used to provide farmers with site-speciﬁc planting date
recommendations.

1. Introduction

Highly variable rainfall (Fauchereau et al., 2003; Rurinda et al.,
2014), the cost and availability of agricultural inputs (Anseeuw et al.,
2012), lack of draught power (Francis et al., 1999), and labour
(Munhande et al., 2013), are some of the key constraints faced by small-
holder farmers in Southern Africa. These are also the leading causes of
delayed and failed planting or lower than achievable plant populations
and crop yields (Collinson, 1987; Rurinda et al., 2014; Roxburgh and

Rodriguez, 2016). These challenges contribute to protracted food short-
ages and malnutrition among smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe
(FEWSNET, 2014; Makuvaro et al., 2014) and elsewhere.

In semi-arid areas of Zimbabwe, late plantings as a result of missed
planting opportunities can lead to complete yield losses (Makuvaro et
al., 2014; Twomlow et al., 2008). For sub-humid regions in Zimbabwe,
previous ﬁndings suggest maize yield reductions of at least 5% per
week's delay in planting (Nyagumbo, 2008; Shumba et al., 1992,
1989); reaching as high as 32% (Shumba et al., 1992). Factors inﬂuenc-
ing planting time are the onset of rainfall and soil temperature (Savin et
al., 2007), though operationally, socio-economic factors will ﬁnally de-
termine when crops are sown. Key socio-economic factors affecting

farmers' decision to plant include available power sources (draught
power, labour (Houmy et al., 2013)), extent of mechanisation for land
preparation and planting, inputs availability (Rurinda et al., 2014),
availability of manual labour, and choice of crop. The reduced need for
land preparation associated with no till practices in CA systems (FAO,
2001) has the potential to enable early planting, while saving labour
and conserving soil moisture (Kucharik, 2006; Marongwe et al., 2012;
Nyamangara et al., 2013). Furthermore, CA has the capacity to reduce
soil loss and run-off (Nyagumbo, 2008); increase soil moisture conser-
vation (Thierfelder and Wall, 2009); reduce weeding labour when her-
bicides are available and used (Muoni et al., 2013); and reduce the
impact of dry spells (Mkoga et al., 2010). The type of CA system used de-
pends on the availability of draught power, with manual CA-Basins
being more dominant among non-draft power users in Zimbabwe
(ZCATF, 2009) and in central Mozambique. Manual ridge and furrow
conventional systems are also commonly used in central Mozambique
and Malawi (Ngwira et al., 2012). CA systems in this region use manual,
dibble stick based CA planting (Ngwira and Aune, 2011). In contrast, an-
imal traction in conventional mouldboard ploughing is more common
in Zimbabwe (ZCATF, 2009) and western parts of Mozambique.

Draught powered mechanized CA systems, have the potential to fur-
ther reduce labour demands associated with land preparation, though
they are still uncommon in Southern Africa (ACIAR, 2013; Jaleta et al.,
2014). Furthermore, the poor livestock condition after the long dry sea-
son, potentially delays planting in conventional mouldboard plough
based systems even when farmers have access to some draught
power. Thus in animal traction cropping systems, greater availability
of household labour and timely land preparation activities are likely to
increase the chances of early planting and higher crop yields.

Farmers in drier or semi-arid parts of Southern Africa tend to use
multiple staggered opportunistic planting to spread the risk associated
with dry spells (Milgroom and Giller, 2013). However, the merits of
such practices have not been quantiﬁed. Previous studies in Zimbabwe
suggest that the time of planting is more important than the type of till-
age system employed (Nyagumbo, 2008). In Zimbabwe the start of the
season for different agro-ecologies is deﬁned based on the time of the
year when precipitation (P) exceeded half the potential evapotranspira-
tion (PET) i.e. P N 0.5PET (Hussein and Johnson, 1987). Further studies
by Raes et al. (2004) deﬁned best planting times based on depth of a
wetting front in the soil, so that planting was recommended whenever
40 mm of rainfall is received within 4 consecutive days. Such a rule can
reduce the risk of a “false season starts” from 2 in every 5 years to 1 in
every 4 years. Other studies in semi-arid Zimbabwe deﬁned the start
of the rainfall season as the ﬁrst day after 1 October when the rainfall ac-
cumulated over 1 or 2 days is at least 20 mm and followed by a period of
not N10 consecutive dry days in the following 30 days (Mupangwa et al.,
2011). However, none of these criteria takes into account farm labour
availability (Mhizha et al., 2014). In Zimbabwe farmers practising CA
are recommended to plant with the ﬁrst rains in order to fully utilize
the season's rainfall (ZCATF, 2009). Unfortunately, farmers practising
CA may plant during the ‘false start’ periods of the season with serious
yield penalties or complete crop failure.

Despite the beneﬁts of early planting (Abdallah, 2012; Gaile, 2012;
Amjadian et al., 2013), ﬁeld observations in Malawi and Mozambique
show that farmers rarely plant early in the season. Furthermore, the ad-
vantages of timely planting are hardly tested in agronomic experiments
comparing farmer's practice and the different CA cropping systems, as
these are usually planted at the same time.

Thus the perceived advantage of timely planting can be evaluated in
essence in farm scale studies, which take into account labour, land size
and other resources impacting farmers' ability to plant their crop.
Such ﬁeld experiments to study early planting are complex and re-
source intensive as they require many years of research and get con-
founded by other seasonal factors hence a crop modelling approach is
warranted. This study therefore investigated the value of planting
time for different CA and non-CA based cropping systems using

previous weather records and the consequent maize yields and their
variability across six contrasting agro-ecologies of Southern Africa
using model simulations.

2. Materials and methods

The study used 30-years of climate records (from 1966 to 2001) and
soil characterisations from six contrasting agro-ecologies across South-
ern Africa (Supplementary Fig. 1). The data generated emerged from
three major steps or procedures (Fig. 1), which involved (i) the quanti-
ﬁcation of household labour availability; (ii) DSSAT model parameteri-
zation and validation; and (iii) analysis of simulated results (Fig. 1).
The procedures used at each step are described below.

Two sites representing wet and dry agro-ecologies were selected from
each of the three countries; Malawi: (Chitedze and Chitala), Mozambique
(Angonia and Chimoio), and Zimbabwe (Marondera and Matopos), Fig. 2.

2.1. Malawi

Chitedze (13.97°S; 33.65°E and 1150 m.a.s.l.) is a sub-humid region
receiving a mean of 900 mm of rainfall per annum, predominant soils
are Ferruginous Alﬁsols. Chitala is a semi-arid region in Malawi's low-
lands (13.25°S; 34.30°E and 606 m.a.s.l.). Chitala receives a mean of
1170 mm of rainfall per annum with the majority falling between No-
vember and May. The site experiences high rainfall variability as well
as high temperatures (Fig. 2). Predominant soils are sandy clay-loam
soils (Young and Brown, 1962). Manually prepared ridges and furrows
and the use of the dibble stick are the most common crop establishment
techniques in Malawi (Ngwira and Aune, 2011).

2.2. Mozambique

Chimoio (19.12°S; 33.47°E and 750 m.a.s.l.) in Manica Province, re-
ceives a mean of 1035 mm total rainfall per year (Harrison et al., 2011).
Typical soils are ﬁne textured, well drained, red in colour and originate
from acidic metamorphic weathering rocks (Famba et al., 2011). Angonia
(14.545°S; 34.185°E and 1220 m.a.s.l.) in Tete Province, receives 947 mm
mean annual rainfall, and the most common soils are Lixisols and Luvisols
(Geurts, 1997; Amane and Mlay, 2002). Like Malawi, farmers here also
commonly use manually prepared ridges and furrows for planting.

2.3. Zimbabwe

Marondera is located in agro-ecological region IIa in Zimbabwe's
Mashonaland East province (18.18°S and 31.55°E and 1689 m.a.s.l.).
The site receives a mean of 813 mm of rainfall per annum and is domi-
nated by light textured sands classiﬁed as Ferric Acrisols (Nyamapfene,
1991). Matopos, (20.378°S; 28.509°E and 1365 m.a.s.l.), is a semi-arid
area in Zimbabwe's agro-ecological region IV in Matabeleland South
Province and receives a mean of 557 mm of rainfall per annum
(Vincent and Thomas, 1961). Predominant soils are Chromic-Leptic
Cambisols (Mashingaidze et al., 2012). The most common cropping sys-
tem across Zimbabwe is animal traction powered maize production
under conventional mouldboard ploughing (ZCATF, 2009).

2.4. Cropping systems

The modelled cropping systems included manual and animal trac-
tion CA systems. As a control, the conventional mouldboard ploughing
early (CMP-early) system mimicked a farmer with full access to draught
oxen, i.e. with the capacity to start land preparation at the onset of the
cropping season. Also a control without access to draught power in a
late cropping system (CMP-late) was included. The latter farmer relies
on hired or borrowed animals only accessible when owners of draught
animals have ﬁnished their own land preparation and planting. Al-
though the ridge and furrow system is commonly used in Malawi and

parts of Mozambique, this study focused on mouldboard ploughing as
the conventional farmer practice. The two conventional ploughing sys-
tems were compared to ﬁve CA systems which included the CA manual
basins early system (CA-Basins early) which follows the recommended
practice of preparing basins before the onset of the season (ZCATF,
2009). CA basins are a commonly used technique in Zimbabwe often en-
abling farmers to plant timely as also conﬁrmed by other studies
(Nyamangara et al., 2013). The CA-Basins late system (CA-Basins late)
assumed that preparation of basins would only commence on receiving
the ﬁrst rains. In addition, two animal traction CA systems were consid-
ered. One of these was the Fitarelli Direct seeding system (CA-Direct
seed), which is capable of seeding, fertilization and covering in one
pass. The other was based on the Magoye Ripper system (CA-Ripper),
consisting of a tine attached onto the conventional mouldboard plough
beam that rips and opens a planting furrow of up to 0.20 m depth. With
this system, rip-lines are opened using a pair of draft animals, usually at
the onset of the season. In the CA-Dibble stick system (CA-Dibble), a
sharp-pointed planting stick is used to manually make shallow holes
(approximately 4–5 cm diameter and 0.03–0.05 m deep) into which
seeds are planted (FAO, 2010). The CA-Dibble stick is used by at least
78% of farmers practising CA in Malawi, and is also used traditionally
in conventional systems for marking planting holes on top of the ridges
(Ngwira and Aune, 2011; Nyagumbo et al., 2016).

2.5. Cropping system labour requirements

Values of farm labour availability at each location were derived from
the results of large household surveys collected across all studied

countries (Supplementary Table 1). The labour days required for plant-
ing a hectare using the six different CA cropping systems was compiled
from on farm research trials managed by CIMMYT and ICRISAT in Mala-
wi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe (Siziba, 2008). Using labour require-
ments data for each system, the time required to prepare and plant
1 ha was determined at each location. This was calculated by dividing
the time in days ha−1 required by each cropping system by the average
labour per household available in each region assuming an 8-h working
day (Supplementary Table 1). We assumed that for each location, the
necessary equipment and draft animals were available.

N.B. CMP-early = Conventional mouldboard ploughing used by
farmers with early access to draft power or CMP-late, used by farmers
with delayed access to draft animals; CA-basins early = CA basins pre-
pared in winter; CA-Basins late = CA Basins prepared at the onset of
rains; CA Direct seed = CA planted with the Fitarelli animal traction di-
rect seeder; CA-ripper = CA with animal traction ripper, CA dibble = CA
seeding using the dibble stick system.

2.6. Earliest planting date

Using 30 years of historical weather (1966–2001) for each of the six
locations (Fig. 2), the earliest possible planting dates were determined
in retrospect for each season and cropping system (Fig. 1). We deﬁned
a planting opportunity as when at least 30 mm of rain were accumulat-
ed over 3 consecutive days, and that planting would take place within
3 days after the rain has stopped (Raes et al., 2004). Calculations were
made using an EXCEL® spreadsheet. We assumed planting beyond
3 days after a rain event would result in germination failure. In cases

Fig. 2. 30 year in-crop rainfall patterns of the study sites located in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. NB: In crop rainfall refers to precipitation received from planting to harvesting.

where the time required for land preparation and seeding exceeded
3 days, planting would be considered only feasible in the next planting
window i.e. when the next 30 mm over three days would be received.
The labour availability, cropping system labour requirements and rain-
fall patterns thus determined planting dates for each season and simu-
lated treatment. Maize yields corresponding to each determined
planting date and cropping system for each year for the varieties
MH26 in Malawi, Tsangano in Mozambique and ZS261 in Zimbabwe,
were then simulated using the validated DSSAT model (Fig. 1).

2.7. DSSAT model parameterisation and validation

DSSAT V4.5, a process based cropping systems model (Jones et al.,
2003), was used to predict maize crop yields in this study. The model
has been used previously to simulate maize yields in other studies in
Southern Africa (Zinyengere et al., 2015). Here the model was set up
based on measured weather, soil and crop management data. It was
then validated against a set of measured phenology and maize yield
data from each of the six locations. The DSSAT model was therefore

set up for each of the six locations to assess the interaction of the key
variables on planting dates and crop yields. For conventional ploughing
systems, the model was speciﬁed to till the soil to 0.25 m using the
mouldboard plough. For CA, the model was speciﬁed to apply 2.5 t
ha−1 of maize residue mulch, and to only till the planting station in
the CA-Dibble stick and CA-Direct seed systems. For the ripper system
the model was speciﬁed to only till the planting row (Jones et al.,
2003; Porter et al., 2010).

The different tillage systems were simulated on the basis of
predetermined soil speciﬁc parameters such as (1) fraction of residue
incorporated, (2) per cent soil surface disturbed, (3) run off curve num-
ber (Table 2), (4) soil bulk density due to tillage, and (5) soil saturated
hydraulic conductivity (Jones et al., 2003; Porter et al., 2010). Different
run-off curve numbers (Endale et al., 2010; Porter et al., 2010), were
thus used for the different cropping systems (Table 2). Soil types in
each speciﬁc agro-ecology had a unique initial run off curve number
that determines erosion, run off and inﬁltration. Tillage equipment
used in different cropping systems further altered the run off curve
number within the same soil type and agro-ecology. The presence or

I. Nyagumbo et al. / Agricultural Systems 150 (2017) 21–33

25

absence of soil cover also altered the run off curve number within the
same soil type, tillage and agro-ecology (WSDOT, 2014).

Within the DSSAT crop management module, the user can specify
the planting date, sowing depth and related aspects on a daily time
scale (Jones et al., 2003). The model however does not account for dis-
eases, pests and socio-economic components such as labour and eco-
nomics (Jones et al., 2003). To bridge this gap,
the labour
requirements for each cropping system were thus computed as stated
earlier using an EXCEL® spreadsheet based on published household la-
bour (Supplementary Table 1), land area and tillage system (Table 1).
The DSSAT model then indirectly accounted for the labour dynamics
in the different locations through the labour constrained predetermined
EXCEL® planting dates for each year and cropping system (Jones et al.,
2003).

2.8. Soil parameterisation

The DSSAT model's soil module was parameterised based on the ob-
served and measured soil characteristics from each of the six agro-ecol-
ogies (Table 2).

2.9. Maize agronomy

At Marondera and Matopos, we simulated a basal application of
compound D (7:14:7) at a rate of 165 kg ha−1, and Ammonium Nitrate
top dressing (34.5% N) at a rate of 200 kg ha−1 (Supplementary Table
3). Similarly for Angonia and Chimoio, the model was set to apply a
basal fertilization (12-24-12) at a rate of 100 kg ha−1, while the top
dressing was applied at 100 kg ha−1 Urea (46% N)(Nyagumbo et al.,
2016; SIMLESA, 2010a). At Chitedze, the basal fertilizer was 165 kg
ha−1 (7:14:7) at planting, and 100 kg ha−1 of Urea (46%N) as top dress-
ing. At Chitala, a basal dressing (23-21-0 (+4S)) was simulated at a rate
of 100 kg ha−1 in combination with Urea applied at 150 kg ha−1
(Nyagumbo et al., 2016; SIMLESA, 2010b). In all cases top dressing
urea or ammonium nitrate was applied at 4–6 weeks after crop emer-
gence. An important assumption in this study is that weed control im-
poses similar labour demands across the tested systems i.e. that
weeds are controlled effectively using herbicides.

2.10. Model testing

Table 3 shows the results of the model testing for maize phenology
and yield under both conventional and CA cropping systems obtained
from experiments previously conducted at each site. The capacity of
the model to reproduce observed results was determined by calculating
the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (Table 3) which was computed as:

2.11. Optimum planting date

The optimum planting date for each location assuming no labour re-
source constraints, was also established by assuming planting would
take place whenever the location received 30 mm rainfall within 3 con-
secutive days in each season. Thus the earliest planting dates (as indi-
cated in the preceding section) differ from optimum planting dates
established here in that the former have restrictions imposed on them
by the labour requirements and available labour in that location as
well as the cropping system. Here, optimum planting date was deﬁned
as the median or mean planting date (Julian date) that matched the
maximum simulated yield over the 30-year period. Yield variability
within ±4 days of the optimum date were computed as the coefﬁcient
of variation (CV) of yields from all simulations within that optimum
planting date period and over the 30 years with no labour constraint
restrictions.

2.12. Data analysis

The labour constrained planting dates and simulated maize yields
for each location, were subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
with seasons or years (n = 30) as replicates using GENSTAT version
17 (VSN, 2011). This enabled statistical comparisons between cropping
systems of the earliest feasible planting date and yield for each location.
Linear regressions of planting date versus year, were used to detect
shifts in planting dates over time for each location. To establish the con-
sequences of early or late planting across the six locations, mean yield
variability, measured by coefﬁcient of variation (CV), were computed
for each site for an 8 day range within the optimum planting date and
40 days before (early) or after (late) this optimum range. The data
was then subjected to ANOVA with site or location as a replicate.

Chitala and Matopos had the highest rainfall variability (CV N 90%)
featuring mostly in the months of October and May while the other
four locations had much lower mean monthly CVs (Fig. 3). Angonia,
Chitedze and Chitala generally have low monthly CVs during the No-
vember–April period (CVs b 55%). Thus the months of October and
May, which correspond to the start and end of the season, respectively,
show the highest variability in rainfall on most locations (Fig. 3).

3.3. Cropping system yield and planting date

Results showed that CA-Basins early, CA-Direct seed and CA-Ripper
systems could be sown signiﬁcantly earlier than CA-Dibble, CMP-early
and CMP-late cropping systems across all the six locations (Fig. 4). At
Angonia, over the 30-year period, CA-Basins early, CA-Direct seed and
CA-Ripper cropping systems, were also seeded earlier than CMP-late
(1 Dec vs. 24 Dec). A similar pattern was also observed at Chimoio
where the CA-Basins early, CA-Direct seed and CA-Ripper cropping sys-
tems, were also sown signiﬁcantly earlier than CMP-late (7 Nov vs. 10
Dec). The pattern was also similar at Chitala, Chitedze, Marondera and
Matopos where CMP-late was always seeded last. The CA-Direct seed
and CA-Ripper cropping systems were always sown with the ﬁrst plant-
ing opportunity (Fig. 4). At Chitala the earliest planting opportunity was
6th Dec with the CA-Basins early, the CA-Direct seed systems and the
CA-Dibble and CMP-early were seeded 3.5 and 4.5 days later, respec-
tively (Fig. 4). Generally, the CA-Basins early system was seeded in the
middle of the planting period, this is 8th and 16th Dec. at both Chitedze
and Chitala, respectively. At Matopos and Marondera the CA-Basins
early was seeded signiﬁcantly earlier than the other systems i.e. on 8
and 10 Nov, respectively. Similar to all locations, the CMP-late system
was sown signiﬁcantly later (P b 0.05), on 15th and 17th Dec, at
Marondera and Matopos, respectively (Fig. 4).

Linear regression analysis of the earliest planting dates against
time (years) combining all cropping systems showed a signiﬁcant
delay (P b 0.05) in planting dates of 0.285 and 0.395 days per year
over the 30 year time series at Chitala and Chitedze in Malawi
(Table 4). However, no signiﬁcant trend was observed at the other
four locations.

Simulations results showed that at Angonia maize yields from CA-
Basins early, CA-Direct seed, CA-Ripper and CMP-early, were signiﬁ-
cantly lower than those from CA-Basins late, CMP-late, and the CA-Dib-
ble cropping systems (Fig. 5). Chimoio also had the lowest yields under
the CA-Basins early cropping system, while CA-Basins late and CMP-
late, showed the highest yields (Fig. 5). At Chitala, maize yield differ-
ences across cropping systems were not signiﬁcant (Fig. 5). Yet the
CMP-early cropping system at Chitedze in Malawi experienced the low-
est yield (2951 kg ha−1), which was in sharp contrast to the signiﬁcant-
ly higher yields (N4000 kg ha−1) in the other cropping systems at that
location.

However at Matopos and Marondera in Zimbabwe, the CMP-late
system showed the lowest yields while the CA-Ripper cropping system
produced the highest yields at both locations (Fig. 5). Thus early plant-
ing achieved with the CA-Ripper on these two locations translated into
higher yields as well. The cumulative distribution functions for grain
yield (Fig. 6) show that out of the six sites, large differences mostly aris-
ing from different planting dates, were observed at Chimoio, Chitedze
and the two Zimbabwean locations Marondera and Matopos. At
Chitedze the CMP-early planting system often caused low yields with
almost zero probability of exceeding 4000 kg ha−1. On the other hand,
Angonia and Chitala showed the narrowest differentials in yields be-
tween systems (Fig. 6). Sites experiencing erratic rainfall patterns dur-
ing the growing season such as Chimoio and Matopos, had high risk of
failure having the lowest probabilities of attaining yields higher than
2500 kg ha−1 (i.e. the minimum yield commonly required by small-
holder farmers to be food secure) (Supplementary Table 4).

3.4. Optimum planting dates for each location

The optimum planting dates varied from location to location (Fig. 7,
Table 5). Thus at Angonia the highest yields were obtained from planting
around 26 Dec (Fig. 7a) while at Chimoio optimum yields (yield CV =
9%), were obtained with planting on 7 Jan (Table 5). The results from
Chimoio showed a high likelihood of complete crop failures (Fig. 7b). At
Chitala, the highest yields were observed on plantings around 27 Dec
(yield CV = 12%), while early plantings i.e. before 13 Oct, led to complete
crop failure (Fig. 4c). At Chitedze, optimum yields were obtained on
plantings around 5 Dec (Table 5, Fig. 7d). At Marondera planting on 4
Dec. would produce optimum yields (Table 4), in spite of a highly erratic
pattern (Fig. 7e). At Matopos planting on 7 Dec (yield CV = 77%) would
give the highest yields (Table 5) while planting earlier than 16 Oct and
later than 4 May would also lead to complete crop failures. Matopos
also showed the most erratic yield pattern of the six locations and
showed fewer planting opportunities than other locations as observed
by the few and sparse data points in scatter plots of maize grain yield
against planting date (Fig. 7f). Except for these two sites Chimoio and
Matopos with highly erratic rainfall patterns, irrespective of cropping
system, yields generally declined as the number of days before or after
the optimum date increased for that location (Fig. 8a).

For each location the calculated median, mean and CV of maize yield
obtained within ±4 days of optimum planting date, also suggested that
the most erratic rainfed cropping environment was Matopos with a
yield CV of 77%, while the most reliable was Angonia with a CV = 8%
(Table 5). Matopos showed the lowest mean and median yield. Similarly
assuming a bell shaped yield curve, results suggest that the most reli-
able environment in terms of rainfall was Angonia (R2 = 85), and that
the least reliable or highest risk location was Matopos (R2 = 28). Conse-
quently, yield variability was thus found to be signiﬁcantly lower (P =
0.007) for optimum date compared to early or late planting practices
(Fig. 8b).

4. Discussion

4.1. Timely planting merits of different cropping systems at each location

The earlier planting with the CA-Basin early, CA-Direct seed and CA-
Ripper, compared to the CMP-early, CA Basins late and CMP-late
cropping systems, were across all locations. This is attributed to differ-
ences in the required labour and time for land preparation (Kucharik,
2006). Planting and basal fertilization operations require extra labour
in manual CA-Basins and CA-Ripper systems but these operations are
conducted simultaneously in the mechanized CA-Direct seed system
and this makes the CA-Direct seed the earliest planting cropping system
(Siziba, 2008). Generally basins are labour intensive (Mazvimavi and

Twomlow, 2009; Nyamangara et al., 2013; Tshuma et al., 2012) hence
they would normally be planted late if preparation commences at the
onset of the rainy season as in the CA-Basins late cropping system.
Field monitoring studies in different parts of Zimbabwe conﬁrm that
winter prepared basins were always planted 12–23 days earlier than
conventionally ploughed ﬁelds and resulted in 43% higher yield returns
to investment compared to conventional plots (Nyamangara et al.,
2013). Farmers using CA-Basins are generally recommended to make
them soon after the previous harvest thereby making the basins ready
for planting upon receiving the ﬁrst rains at the start of the next season
(ZCATF, 2009). Early preparation of planting basins before the onset of
the rainfall season enables farmers to spread labour (Ndlovu et al.,
2014; Twomlow et al., 2008). This facilitates spreading of labour bottle-
necks associated with land preparation at the start of the season thus
CA-Basins early could be seeded earlier as observed in this study. This
pattern was generally consistent across all locations despite variations
in the available labour. Generally the CMP-early cropping system was
also seeded relatively earlier in the season across all locations as farmers
using this system had ready access to draught power which hastened
land preparation and planting (Mugabe and Banga, 2001).

Despite the mechanized operations from draught power, increased
land preparation labour requirements associated with ploughing, re-
sulted in the CMP-early still being seeded later than the manual CA-Ba-
sins early, animal traction CA-Direct seed and CA-Ripper at Chitala,
Chitedze, Marondera and Matopos but later than CA-Basins late and
CMP late systems. The CA-Direct seed system proved to be more advan-
tageous when labour was limiting as the combined fertilizer application
and seed placement in one pass, enabled faster planting (Siziba, 2008).
On the other hand using the ripper which eliminates the need for con-
ventional ploughing and hence reducing draught power demands, also
ensured planting was achieved within the earliest planting window
(FAO, 2001). In addition, CA-Ripper saves time and labour since it only
takes a ﬁfth of the time required to plant as it disturbs soil only along
the planting rows whereas the plough disturbs the whole ﬁeld. The
CMP-late cropping system was seeded signiﬁcantly later than the
CMP-early system due to the delay in accessing draught power required
for land preparation. Generally farmers without draft animals have to
wait at least 2 weeks to access them and only prepare their land when

the draught power owners have ﬁnished land preparation (Ellis-Jones
and Whitmore, 2004). This delay was often exacerbated by the absence
of a planting opportunity soon after completion of land preparation due
to the early or mid-season dry spells in some agro-ecologies.

The CA-Dibble stick cropping system which is one of the predomi-
nant CA systems in Malawi (Ngwira and Aune, 2011), was seeded rela-
tively earlier than CA-Basins late and CMP-late, on 8 and 10 Dec. at
Chitedze and Chitala, respectively. This was 4 and 5 days after seeding
the CA-Basins early system, whereas the CMP-late was seeded later.

Marondera and Matopos showed 35 and 39 day differences in plant-
ing dates between the ﬁrst and last planting opportunity in the CA-Ba-
sins early and CMP-late systems respectively. At Angonia and Chimoio
these differences amounted to 23 and 20 days, while at Chitala and
Chitedze it was 27 days. The planting window was wider at Matopos
and Marondera because of the low rainfall, mid-season droughts and
high intra and inter-season rainfall variability (Tshuma et al., 2012).

Findings of the study also suggests gradual delays in commencement
of the planting date by at least 0.285 and 0.395 days yr−1 for Chitala and
Chitedze sites of Malawi, respectively. This may be attributed to changes
in rainfall patterns associated with increased rainfall variability during
the 30-yr simulation period. Climate change forecasts suggest a future
decrease in rainfall by at least 7% for the Sub Saharan African region
(Bouba et al., 2013) which would mean cropping systems that increase
season length would potentially help to mitigate the negative effects of
such phenomena. An analysis of rainfall seasons in semi-arid Zimbabwe
however showed no signiﬁcant changes in the length of seasons
(Mupangwa et al., 2011) as also found here for the Zimbabwean sites.

4.2. Cropping systems and maize yield

Generally early planting extends the maize crop growing period or
season length, thus potentially increasing maize yields and vice versa
(Farnham, 1998). Results from this study suggested that CA cropping
systems enable early planting but this did not necessarily lead to the

highest yields. Furthermore, the optimum planting dates, which can
give rise to the highest yield as expected (Darby and Lauer, 1996), var-
ied with location due to agro-ecology differences. The simulated opti-
mum planting dates established by the study, agreed fairly well with
observed farmer practices at these sites. The rainfall variability analysis
(Fig. 3) showed that Angonia, Chitala and Chitedze sites experience high
rainfall variability in Oct and Nov and hence any planting made before
Dec could result in crop failure, even if the labour requirements enabled
such early planting. Thus these 3 locations characterized by high
monthly rainfall variability exceeding 80% at the start of the season,
failed to translate the early planting beneﬁts derived from CA cropping
systems into higher yields. For example, at Angonia the CA-Basin early,
CA-Ripper, CA-Dibble and CMP-early cropping systems had the lowest
yields, despite being sown signiﬁcantly earlier than other systems. De-
layed planting after the earliest planting windows did not result in
yield losses but instead led to yield gains of at least 8% at this location.
For the latter 3 CA systems, this yield depression was attributed to
planting (1 Nov) coinciding with a period of high rainfall variability
(85%). On the contrary, CA-Dibble stick, CA-Basin late and CMP-late sys-
tems were seeded later in December (13–24 Dec) but during a month
characterized by relatively low rainfall variability of 38%. Thus the
three cropping systems yielding the most were those planted closest
(24 Dec) to the optimum planting date of 26 Dec. In addition, the simu-
lated highest yield was obtained with planting on 26 Dec in agreement
with farmer practices of planting before or after 25 Dec. It is therefore
clear that maize in early planted CA systems coincided with poor early
season erratic rains which caused emergence failure and wilting of the
young maize crop thus giving a ‘false start’ of the season (Lone and
Warsi, 2009; Raes et al., 2004). Angonia is a high rainfall environment
usually experiencing peak rainfall during the ﬁrst week of February. In
such an environment if the selected maize cultivar's growing cycle ﬁts
within the season, there are less chances of it failing to yield to its poten-
tial under the imposed management conditions. Furthermore variety
characteristics could have inﬂuenced maize performance particularly

if severe water stresses were experienced during the ﬂowering period
when maize is highly sensitive (Tsimba et al., 2013). The variety used
in this case, a medium maturing open pollinated variety known as
Tsangano, taking about 140 days to mature.

At Chimoio the mean planting date for CA-Basins early, CA-Ripper,
CA-Dibble was 7 Nov (rainfall CV = 50%) that is two months before
the optimum planting date (7 Jan with a rainfall CV of 49%). At this
site the CA systems, despite being planted early, also failed to translate
to higher yields. Yet the late planted CA-Basins late and the convention-
al late which were planted closer (24 Nov and 10 Dec, respectively) but

still well before the optimum planting date (7 Jan), yielded higher than
the early planted CA systems. This result further highlights the fact that
early planting using CA systems could only have yield advantages if it
coincided with the optimum planting date or a month with the low
rainfall variability (b60%).

Non-signiﬁcant yield differences were realised between the seven
cropping systems at Chitala in Malawi. This was despite the fact that
the earliest seeding was conducted on 6 Dec in the CA-Basins early
whereas the last seeding was conducted on 26 Dec. This 20-day differ-
ence in planting the CA-Basins early and CMP-late cropping systems

did not result in yield losses. This lack of signiﬁcant differences was at-
tributed to high temperatures (FAO, 2006) which are conducive for
maize development at Chitala such that the delay in planting could not
cause signiﬁcant maize yield losses because there was sufﬁcient rainfall
to sustain crop growth. As stated earlier, the Chitala site experienced
the highest rainfall variability in Oct. and apparently the earliest planting
at this site was on 6 Dec. Dec had a low rainfall variability of 55% having
dropped from a high of 96% in Nov, hence rainfall is much more reliable in
Dec thereby leading to the lack of signiﬁcant differences in yield between
the cropping systems. The established optimum planting date was 27 Dec
for Chitala and hence the majority of farmers in that area also planted
around that time. Similarly, at Chitedze planting was done within
20 days of the optimum planting date of 5 Dec and mostly within the
month of Dec which had low rainfall variability of 48%, thereby resulting
in insigniﬁcant differences between cropping systems. This was consis-
tent with results from Chitala. The month of Nov had a much higher
rainfall variability of 69% and so any planting in early Nov could be risky.
In contrast to the above, the only sites where early planting with CA
gave yield advantages were Marondera and Matopos which are sub-
humid and semi-arid locations, respectively (Figs. 2, 5). The highest
maize yields were obtained from the earliest sown CA-Basins early,
CA-Ripper and CA-Direct seed cropping systems whereas the lowest
yields were obtained from the CMP-late cropping systems. At Matopos
the lowest CV of 60% was in Nov. after which the rainfall CVs dramatical-
ly increased to N100% by March. (Fig. 3). At Marondera the highest
yields were derived from the ripper system which was planted on 1
Dec i.e. only 3 days before the optimum planting date (4 Dec). Planting
at that time coincided with the lowest rainfall variability of 60% in Dec.
Here the ripper system was planted on 15 November i.e. the month with
the lowest rainfall variability at that site of 55% and this took place close
to the optimum planting date of 7 December. Results thus suggest that
the early planting advantage of CA only translated to yield beneﬁts
when planting coincided with the optimum planting period or the
months with relatively lower rainfall variability.

However, generally the low yields obtained at Matopos are attribut-
ed to the low annual rainfall (353 mm) and high seasonal rainfall vari-
ability (N30%) (Vincent and Thomas, 1961). Thus delayed planting,
coupled with low rainfall, led to signiﬁcant yield losses due to the re-
duced growing period under reduced soil moisture. Delayed planting
of the CMP-late system by 21 days led to 15% yield loss at Matopos.
This was in agreement with ﬁndings by Shumba et al. (1989) who
realised yield losses of at least 5% per week's delay in planting in
semi-arid areas of southern Zimbabwe. Similarities between model

simulations and farmer practices in timing of planting, though less pre-
cise, were also apparent at Marondera and Matopos. The fewer planting
opportunities at Matopos were attributed to relatively lower rainfall
and higher intra and inter seasonal rainfall variation of this semi-arid lo-
cation (Vincent and Thomas, 1961). On the other hand, delayed planting
at Marondera beyond Dec. caused low yields. This is attributed to the
low temperatures from Dec. onwards where average summer tempera-
tures are 27.9 °C which approach 21 °C in January and 7 °C in winter
(Masaka et al., 2014). Therefore, as the season progresses the tempera-
tures approach 8 °C, the base temperature for maize development. Each
phenological stage of maize development requires a certain amount of
growing degree days (GDD) to be attained. The low temperatures
characterising Marondera led to the delay in attainment of the required
GDD for each speciﬁc phenological stage thus reducing maize growth
rates (White, 2001). This has an impact on the crop which will mature
when soil moisture will no longer be sufﬁcient for maize development
(Miller et al., 2001). In contrast early planting enables the crop to pass
through certain physiological stages at a faster rate (Weinman, 1975),
thus the grain ﬁlling period will coincide with the period of low temper-
atures which promotes slow grain ﬁlling which is essential for attaining
high yields (Badu-Apraku et al., 1983).

The results therefore make two points apparent. Firstly, irrespective
of cropping system, any planting occurring close to the optimum plant-
ing date or in the month with the lowest rainfall variability or at least
lower than 60%, gave the highest yield response. Consequently, planting
during the optimum date period resulted in signiﬁcantly lower yield
variability across all the six locations (Fig. 8). These ﬁndings conﬁrm
ﬁeld based results from experiments in Zimbabwe which suggested
that the time of planting was much more important to yield than the
tillage system used (Nyagumbo, 2008). Secondly the early planting ad-
vantages of CA systems such as CA-Basins early, CA-Direct seeding and
Ripping, resulted in signiﬁcant yield advantages only if the planting
month had low rainfall variability or close to the optimum planting
date. Whenever such planting took place in the high rainfall variability
months, then chances of crop failure were high with signiﬁcant yield
penalties. This suggests that if yield maximization is the objective,
then farmer decisions on when to plant may need to be guided by the
optimum planting date.

5. Conclusion

It is concluded that draught powered mechanized CA systems and
winter prepared CA basins, enable earlier planting of maize due to less

32

I. Nyagumbo et al. / Agricultural Systems 150 (2017) 21–33

labour requirements and earlier land preparation. Thus draught power
mechanized CA systems offer farmers the capacity to plant closer to op-
timum dates. Optimum planting dates generated from model simula-
tions for each location matched farmer practices and resulted in the
lowest CV (%) in yield compared to later or earlier plantings. Hence
planting maize during periods close to the optimum planting dates re-
sulted in high yields irrespective of the cropping system, making plant-
ing date one of the key rainfed maize yield determinants in the region.
This suggests that the optimum planting dates generated this way
could potentially be used to provide farmers with location speciﬁc
guides on when to plant to attain higher yields and lower yield variabil-
ity between seasons.

The study also made it apparent that there are signiﬁcant shifts in
planting dates associated with rainfall patterns amounting to average
delays of 0.28 and 0.39 days yr−1 at Chitala and Chitedze, Malawi over
the simulated 30 years between 1966 and 2001.

Further, participatory ﬁeld-based studies could be useful to support
farmers' learning of the ﬁndings from this model based study and to es-
tablish the key characteristics and boundary conditions necessary for
regional locations to beneﬁt from early planting of crops. In situations
where meteorological data is available there is need to invest in model
simulations studies to establish the optimum planting dates across
agro-ecologies to support farmers in new regions and other Sub Saharan
African countries.
