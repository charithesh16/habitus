We evaluated recommendations provided by a cloud-based decision-support tool named Nutrient
Manager for Rice (NMR) in terms of yield of irrigated lowland rice and proﬁtability in comparison with
farmers’ fertilizer management practices (FFP) in the Senegal River valley. A total of 102 on-farm trials
were conducted over the three seasons (2011 wet season, and 2012 and 2013 dry seasons). On average
in each season, NMR recommendations increased rice yield by 1–2.3 t/ha and proﬁtability by US$ 216–
640 per ha compared to FFP. Differences between FFP and NMR performance were mainly related to tim-
ing of the top-dressing of N fertilizer (delayed in the case of FFP), the number of N fertilizer applications
(generally just one top-dressing for FFP; two or three for NMR), and application of K. We conclude that
NMR offers a promising avenue for increasing the productivity and proﬁtability of irrigated lowland rice
in the Senegal River valley.

1. Introduction

In Senegal, only about 40% of total rice (Oryza spp.) consump-
tion is satisﬁed through domestic production (ANSD, 2011). High
dependence on imported rice renders the country vulnerable to
international market shocks with severe consequences for food
security and political stability (Seck et al., 2010). The Senegalese
government aims to increase rice production through support to
irrigated-rice farmers in the Senegal River valley (SRV). Average
rice yield is generally high in both wet and dry seasons at 5.4
and 6.6 t/ha, respectively; however, there is large variation among
farmers (e.g. Wopereis et al., 1999; Poussin et al., 2003). Wopereis
et al. (1999) report that yield gaps between potential yield simu-
lated by the ecophysiological crop model ORYZA_S (Dingkuhn,

1995; Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997) and actual yields obtained by
farmers ranged from 1.8 to 8.2 t/ha, suggesting that there was large
scope for improving rice yield in this area. It has been reported that
farmers generally did not follow recommended sowing time, fertil-
izer rates, and timings – they generally sowed late, applied late and
in excess (Wopereis et al., 1999; Poussin et al., 2003; Tanaka et al.,
2015). Following these ﬁndings, Haefele et al. (2000, 2001) con-
ducted on-farm trials and found that improved nutrient manage-
ment increased yields by about 1 t/ha in farmers’ ﬁelds.

Based on these numerous studies, recommended N rates by
Société Nationale d’Aménagement et d’Exploitation des Terres du
Delta du ﬂeuve Sénégal et des Vallées du ﬂeuve Sénégal (SAED)
range from 133 to 179 kg/ha, applied as di-ammonium phosphate
(DAP) at around sowing or transplanting, and three splits of urea
(at early tillering, panicle initiation, and booting) (SAED, personal
communication). Differences in application rates depend on season
and agro-ecological zone. The recommended rate is higher in the
dry season (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004), and higher in the
Senegal River delta than in the middle valley, where extreme tem-
peratures tend to occur and affect potential yield. Recommended
P2O5 and K2O rates are 46 and 0 kg/ha, respectively. K2O fertilizer
application is not recommended because K inputs from irrigation
water and from dust depositions are considered sufﬁcient
(Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). In a previous study, K2O fertilizer
application was recommended when target yield was 8 t/ha or

more (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). But, when this recommenda-
tion was developed, most of farmers did not carry out double crop-
ping and target high yield.

Most rice farmers in Africa depend on blanket recommenda-
tions, despite the fact that optimal amounts and sources of nutri-
ents to meet the needs of the crop depend on many factors, such
as indigenous soil nutrient supply, variety choice, and target yield.
Scientists at
the West Africa Rice Development Association
(WARDA, now Africa Rice Center [AfricaRice]) developed variety-,
site- and season-speciﬁc recommendations on nutrient manage-
ment for irrigated lowland rice in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal
(Haefele et al., 2003; Haefele and Wopereis, 2004; Segda et al.,
2005). Simulation models such as ORYZA_S and RIDEV were used
to determine potential yield level as a function of sowing date,
location, and variety choice (Dingkuhn, 1995; Dingkuhn and Sow,
1997). However, none of

ﬁeld-speciﬁc recommendations.

approaches

these

Recent advances in information technology and mobile commu-
nications make it possible for extension workers and farmers to
generate variety-, ﬁeld-, and season-speciﬁc recommendations on
crop management practices for rice by using a smartphone or
tablet. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has devel-
oped a cloud-based decision-support
tool named Nutrient
Manager for Rice (NMR) to deal with such speciﬁcity and provide
farmers with ﬁeld-speciﬁc nutrient management recommenda-
tions before the cropping season (the version currently in the pub-
lic domain is called Crop Manager; http://cropmanager.irri.org/).
This approach relies on the scientiﬁc principles determined during
15 years of site-speciﬁc nutrient management (SSNM) research
across Asia (e.g. Dobermann et al., 2002; Buresh et al., 2010).
NMR provides advice on when, how much, and what sort of fertil-
izer to apply. NMR can be accessed through a personal computer,
smartphone, or tablet by agricultural extension ofﬁcers or lead
farmers. The recommendations are calculated from farmers’ replies
to questions about the agro-ecological or administrative zone of
their ﬁeld, the variety of rice, availability of irrigation water, previ-
ous crop and management of its residue, previous rice yield levels,
and fertilizer use. Although information is still limited on the
impact of NMR on yield and proﬁtability in Asia, it has been
reported in the Philippines that fertilizer management based on
NMR increased yield by 0.37 t/ha per season (Gabinete and
Buresh, 2013). This gain was similar to values observed in previous
studies on SSNM in Asia (Dobermann et al., 2002). IRRI and
AfricaRice have worked together to develop NMR for the SRV
through the use of data on yields from previous fertilizer trials in
irrigated lowland rice in West Africa for estimating indigenous N
supply (e.g. Wopereis et al., 1999; Haefele and Wopereis, 2004),
potential yield and optimum sowing windows (Dingkuhn and
Sow, 1997), and expert knowledge on crop duration of popular
varieties and crop management in the SRV. This paper describes
the framework of NMR developed for the SRV and reports on its
evaluation on farm during three growing seasons (2011 wet sea-
son, and 2012 and 2013 dry seasons). The objective of this work
was to compare rice yields obtained using NMR recommendations
with yields obtained by farmers not using the tool (FFP).

2. Material and methods

2.1. Description of the study area

The Senegal River valley (SRV) is located in the tropical – war-
m/arid zone (Saito et al., 2013). Five agro-ecological zones (AEZs)
are locally distinguished in this area (Haefele and Wopereis,
2004). In this study, we considered AEZ I and AEZ II as the
Senegal River delta, and AEZ III and AEZ IV as the Senegal River

the year

middle valley. Average annual rainfall is about 200 mm with one
rainy season (July–September). Solar radiation is high and for a
ranges from 20 to 30 MJ/(m2 day).
large part of
Temperature is variable across AEZs, but the coastal area is cooler
than the continental area (Dingkuhn, 1995). Soils are generally
course to medium textured in the delta, and medium to ﬁne tex-
tured in the middle valley (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004). The irri-
gated lowland rice production system in this study area has been
described in numerous studies (e.g. Wopereis et al., 1999;
Haefele and Wopereis, 2004).

2.2. Framework of Nutrient Manager for Rice for the Senegal River
valley

NMR for SRV has been developed by IRRI as an HTML5 applica-
tion which means it can be accessed through a web browser, using
any of the major operating systems with equal effectiveness, from
a smartphone or a personal computer (http://webapps.irri.org/nm/
wa/). For this paper, we used NMR pre-release version 1. The NMR
recommendations are based on information obtained on the
following:

 Agro-ecological zone (i.e. Senegal River delta or middle valley)
 Size of the ﬁeld
 Number of rice crops to be cultivated per year (one or two)
 Season (wet or dry)
 Rice variety to be sown
 Crop establishment method (transplanted or direct seeded)
 Approximate rice yields in previous seasons
 Portion of residues from previous crop retained in the ﬁeld (i.e.

short or long stubble)

 Expected water supply level during rice growing season (ade-

quate or inadequate)

 The type of fertilizers to be or already purchased.

information from farmers and outputs,

A ﬂow chart for determining N, P, and K fertilizer application
rates and timing is shown in Fig. 1. White boxes indicate input data
obtained from previous studies, reported by experts in this region,
or calculated intermediate outputs. Gray and black boxes indicate
input
respectively.
Potential yield and crop duration were calculated from information
on season, AEZ, choice of variety, and crop establishment method.
In previous studies, these were determined using the crop model
ORYZA_S with variety-speciﬁc photo-thermal parameters using
long-term historical weather data (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004).
We used expert knowledge on potential yield and crop duration
based on observation at the research stations of AfricaRice in the
delta and middle valley, as photo-thermal parameters of new vari-
eties are unavailable. Rice growth stages (e.g. panicle initiation,
booting) were then empirically determined using information on
crop duration of each variety (e.g. panicle initiation equals crop
duration minus 60 days). Potential yield of all the varieties in the
Senegal River delta was estimated at 9 and 10 t/ha in wet and
dry seasons, respectively, and potential yield was taken as 8 t/ha
for both seasons in the middle valley. Target yield is determined
by a farmer’s answers concerning yield level on the same ﬁeld dur-
ing previous seasons, and maximum target yield set at 80% of
potential yield, as the risk of lowering proﬁtability is higher when
target yield is above 80% (Haefele et al., 2003). If there is a large gap
between 80% of potential and the farmer’s yield level, NMR will
propose a large yield increase from the current level. If the gap is
small, NMR will propose a small yield increase up to 80% of poten-
tial. Also, farmers can modify the target yield, when they are not
satisﬁed with target yield or fertilizer application rate. In this
study, difference in target yield and the previous yield level
reported by farmers ranged from almost zero to 5 t/ha.

The framework in NMR uses the SSNM approach, which pro-
vides scientiﬁc principles for determining the amounts of N, P,
and K that best match the ﬁeld-speciﬁc needs of rice for supple-
mental nutrients (Witt and Dobermann, 2004; Buresh et al.,
2010, 2012). The fertilizer N required (FN, expressed in kg N/ha)
to achieve the target yield is determined from the anticipated yield
gain in response to application of fertilizer N and a targeted efﬁ-
ciency of fertilizer N used to obtain the targeted yield (Fig. 1):
ð1Þ
FN ¼ ðGY   GY0NÞ=ðAEN=1000Þ
where GY   GY0N is the increase in grain yield due to fertilizer N,
which is the difference between the target yield (GY) (t/ha) and
yield without N fertilizer (GY0N) (t/ha). The GY0N is the N-limited
grain yield, which reﬂects
the yield attainable from only
non-fertilizer sources of N, referred to as the indigenous N supply.
AEN is the targeted agronomic efﬁciency of fertilizer N (kg grain
yield increase per kg of fertilizer N applied). The targeted AEN is
adjusted for crop and crop response to N, based on results of ﬁeld
trials conducted across Asia in the development and veriﬁcation
of SSNM principles (Fairhurst et al., 2007). The targeted AEN for rice
typically ranges from 16 to 25 kg increase in grain yield per kg of
fertilizer N applied. The relationship between GY and GY0N was
derived from the results of ﬁeld trials conducted in six West
African countries (Fig. 2). Data are from the SRV in Senegal and
Mauritania, northern Ghana, Kou valley in Burkina Faso, Kano in
Nigeria, and Ofﬁce du Niger in Mali (Wopereis et al., 1999;
Haefele et al., 2001, 2003; authors, unpublished data). In these tri-
als, rice was grown in irrigated lowland with or without NPK fertil-
izer application, except for a few trials which included yield with PK
fertilizer instead of treatment with NPK fertilizer application. In
Asian studies (e.g. Dobermann et al., 2003a,b), GY0N was deter-
mined in PK-fertilized plots (‘minus N’ plots). However, in West
Africa, we do not have a lot of data on yield in minus N plots.
Thus, we decided to use yield without NPK fertilizer application.
This should be feasible, as N is the most limiting nutrient for yield
in irrigated rice in West Africa (e.g. Wopereis et al., 1999; Haefele
et al., 2002). The relationships between yield with NPK fertilizer
and GY0N were variable within each country, but there was no large
difference in the relationship across the countries: 57% of the vari-
ation in GY0N could be explained by one simple regression curve

West African countries. The simple regression curve is for all the countries.

using GY (Fig. 2). As we did not have any other variables to provide
better explanation of the variation in GY0N, we used this regression
for estimating GY0N and (GY   GY0N) from yield with NPK fertilizer
(which is GY). Then, together with AEN, FN was calculated following
Eq. (1). Fig. 3 shows the relationship between GY and FN. Thus, in
the NMR framework, total N fertilizer application rate is determined
by target yield. Use of the simple regression curve in Fig. 2 could
eliminate variation in yield response to N fertilizer, and this uncer-
tainty of use of a simple regression without considering other fac-
tors is discussed in the discussion section.

With the SSNM approach, P and K fertilizers are applied in suf-
ﬁcient amounts to overcome deﬁciencies. We used a full mainte-
nance approach for P, and a partial maintenance approach for K,
which are described by Buresh et al. (2010). Total P and K taken
up by the crop are determined from the target yield and an estab-
lished optimal reciprocal internal efﬁciency (kg nutrient in above-
ground dry matter per t grain) for each crop (Buresh et al., 2010).

regression curve is calculated in NMR for the SRV, and points are from a previous
study in Senegal (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004).

The requirement of a crop for fertilizer P (FP, kg/ha) or fertilizer K
(FK, kg/ha) to achieve a GY is estimated from the deﬁcit in the
nutrient balance with each input expressed in kg/ha (Buresh
et al., 2010) (Fig. 1):
FP ¼ GY  RIEP   PCR   PA

ð2Þ

FK ¼ GY  RIEK   KCR   Kw   KS   KA

ð3Þ

where RIEP is reciprocal internal efﬁciency for P expressed in kg
plant P at maturity per tonne of grain (kg P/t grain) produced,
RIEK is reciprocal internal efﬁciency of K expressed in kg plant K
per tonne of grain (kg K/t grain), PCR and KCR are P and K retained
in the residues of previous rice crop, Kw is K input with irrigation
water (kg/ha), KS is threshold limit for drawdown of soil K reserves
(kg/ha), and PA and KA are atmospheric deposition (kg/ha) for P and
K. Input of P in irrigation water is treated as negligible. We do not
consider inputs of P and K from organic matter as application of
organic matter is not popular in the SRV. RIEP and RIEK are
6.2 kg P/t grain and 19.2 kg K/t grain, respectively. PCR and KCR are
determined based on farmer’s harvesting practice, and harvest
indices used for P ([P in grains]/[P in total aboveground biomass])
and K, which are estimated at 0.7 and 0.15, respectively (Buresh
et al., 2010). Kw is 35 and 49 kg/ha in wet and dry seasons, respec-
tively, calculated using data from Haefele (2001) with the assump-
tion that irrigated water is 1000 and 1400 mm in wet and dry
seasons, respectively. Data for PA and KA are from Herrmann
(1996) (data not shown), and PA and KA are the same for both zones,
and considered only in the wet season (they are zero in the dry sea-
son). KS is estimated at 30 kg/ha in both seasons, based on
long-term trials and previous studies (Haefele et al., 2002; Haefele
and Wopereis, 2004; Bado et al., 2010), showing that extractable
K content in the topsoils did not change without K application even
though straw was removed from the ﬁelds in long-term trials, and
suggesting that the soil K pool could be replenished by nonex-
changeable soil K and/or capillary rise during the non-cropped
part(s) of the year.

In the NMR framework, FP and FK were calculated based on sea-
son (wet or dry), approximate rice yield in previous season, portion
of residues from previous crop retained in the ﬁeld (i.e. short or
long stubble), and target yield (information obtained from individ-
ual farmers for each season in this study), as well as input param-
eters deﬁned above (Fig. 1; Eqs. (2) and (3)). The relationship
between GY and FP is shown in Fig. 4. With the given yield in
the previous season, FP is mainly determined by target yield, and

by NMR for the SRV. Yield of previous crop is taken as 6 t/ha.

moderately by PCR, which is ﬁeld speciﬁc and affected by yield of
previous crop, residue management, and PA. Fig. 4 shows that FP
is low in the wet season, when long stubbles are retained from
the previous crop, and when target yield is low. Difference in FP
between wet and dry season (corresponding with PA difference)
with the same residue management treatment for a given yield
level is similar to the difference in FP between the two residue
management treatments for the same season.

The relationship between GY and FK is shown in Fig. 5a and b. In
Fig. 5a, for the given yield in previous season, FK is mainly deter-
mined by target yield and KCR, and moderately affected by seasonal
effects (through combined effect of Kw and KA as they are season
speciﬁc). Larger effect of KCR on FK than that of PCR on FP is associ-
ated with lower harvest indices for K than for P, which indicate
that larger part of K was in straw – if large part of straw can be kept
in the ﬁelds, FK can be signiﬁcantly reduced.

NMR considers three types of N-, P-, and K-containing fertiliz-
ers. Here, it is deﬁned that P-containing fertilizer can have N and/or
K elements, whereas N- and K-containing fertilizers do not have PK
and NP elements, respectively. Basal fertilizer will be applied
within 3 weeks for direct-seeded rice or at transplanting for trans-
planted rice. Top-dressing of N application is at active tillering,
panicle initiation, and booting. But, N application at booting is con-
sidered only when target yield is 7.5 t/ha or more (Wopereis-Pura
et al., 2002). All the P- and K-containing fertilizers are applied
basally in the current version of NMR for Senegal. For calculation
of the amount of fertilizers to be applied, rate of P-containing fer-
tilizer is ﬁrst determined by FP. If P-containing fertilizer includes N
and/or K, the N and K applied in the P-containing fertilizer is sub-
tracted from FN and FK. Then, N- and/or K-containing fertilizer is
additionally applied as basal fertilizer. If P-containing fertilizer
includes N and N rate in P-containing fertilizer is more than target
N application rate at basal application, top-dressed N rates at
active tillering and panicle initiation are reduced. When
P-containing fertilizer includes more K fertilizer than the target
FK, FP determines amount of K-containing fertilizer applied,
assuming that excessive K has no negative effect of rice growth.
This latter is the case when compound fertilizer N–P2O5–K2O 9–
23–30 is used instead of DAP (18–46–0). Fig. 5a and b shows FK
determined by P-containing fertilizer that does not include K such
as DAP, and when farmers use the compound fertilizer (9–23–30).

Fig. 5. Relationship between target yield and K fertilizer requirement determined by NMR for the SRV. Yield of previous crop is taken as 6 t/ha. K fertilizer requirement is
determined for situations of: (a) a P-containing fertilizer that does not include K (e.g. DAP), and (b) when farmers use the compound fertilizer (9–23–30).

From these calculations and ﬁeld size, ﬁeld-speciﬁc fertilizer appli-
cation rates and timings are determined, and the information pro-
vided to farmers on the output page of the NMR application.

2.3. Experimental design and data collection in on-farm trials

Rice yields derived by NMR were compared with yields
obtained with farmers’ fertilizer practices (FFP) in 20, 58, and 24
on-farm trials in the 2011 wet season, 2012 dry season, and
2013 dry season, respectively (referred to as 2011WS, 2012DS,
and 2103DS). In total over three seasons, 21 on-farm trials were
conducted in the Senegal River delta and 81 in the middle valley.
There were two treatments: (1) FFP and (2) NMR recommenda-
tion in 2011WS and 2012DS. In both years, KCl was used as K fer-
tilizer source, although none of the farmers used KCl fertilizer in
their FFP. In 2013DS, additional treatment on NMR recommenda-
tion was included through use of compound fertilizer N–P2O5–
K2O (9–23–30) as K fertilizer source, as this fertilizer was more
available than KCl in the market, resulting in three treatments in
each farmer’s ﬁeld.

In each rice ﬁeld, plots of 100–300 m2 were installed for each
treatment. There was no replication in each farmer’s ﬁeld.
Management practices were left to the farmer, except for fertilizer
application. NMR recommendations were determined before the
season through interviews with farmers to obtain the information
described above. Fertilizer management practice in terms of fertil-
izer source, timing, and amount planned by the farmer was also
collected before the season through interview, and FFP was simu-
lated by the research team. This was to avoid NMR recommenda-
tion being copied by the farmers. At maturity, rice yields were
obtained from a 10 m2 surface area in the center of each plot,
and yields were corrected to 14% moisture content.

2.4. Proﬁtability and statistical analysis

Fertilizer costs (1 euro = 656 FCFA) were collected from SAED
data: urea, 120 FCFA/kg; DAP, 360 FCFA/kg; KCl, 720 FCFA/kg;
and N–P2O5–K2O (9–23–30), 199 FCFA/kg. Paddy price was
125 FCFA/kg. We did not include any costs for bagging and trans-
port of the paddy, or transport and labor for fertilizer application.
In this study, proﬁtability was deﬁned as the difference between
the value of the paddy and the total cost of fertilizer to be

purchased. We did not include any other cost of crop management,
or additional labor cost or bags needed as a result of yield increase.
For each growing season, ANOVA mixed models were ﬁtted for
yield, proﬁtability, and fertilizer application rates and timings
(Table 1). Treatment was considered as ﬁxed effect and AEZ (here,
we consider two zones described above; the Senegal River delta
and the Senegal River middle valley), farmer nested into AEZ,
treatment  AEZ as random effects. For 2013DS, we performed a
Tukey’s Honest Signiﬁcant Difference test when there was a signif-
icant effect of the treatment (Kramer, 1956). As % of ﬁelds receiving
second and third top-dress of N (Table 1) are categorical variables,
a Fisher’s exact test of independence was used to respectively
examine the signiﬁcance of their association with the treatment
(Martín Andrés and Herranz Tejedor, 1995). All the analyses were
conducted using SAS (2008).

Simple linear regression analysis was performed to identify
relationships (1) between difference in K2O fertilizer rate between
MMR with DAP and compound fertilizer N–P2O5–K2O (9–23–30)
and yield difference between two treatments
in 2013DS;
(2) between sowing date and the difference between actual yield
obtained in this study and target yield in NMR; (3) between yield
in FFP and yield difference between NMR and FFP; and (4) between
yield in FFP and difference in proﬁtability between NMR and FFP.

3. Results

3.1. Farmers’ agronomic practices and rice yields

Except for 18 farmers in middle valley in 2012DS, ﬁelds were
direct seeded (manually broadcast). Seeding dates ranged from
22 August to 26 September in 2011WS, from 29 February to 1
April in the 2012DS, and from 5 to 23 March in the 2013DS. In
transplanted rice, seedling age at transplanting was between 26
and 35 days. All farmers grew improved varieties. Popular varieties
in the wet season were Sahel 202 (65% of farmers) and Sahel 201
(30%), while 60% and 92% grew Sahel 108 in 2012DS and 2013DS,
respectively.

Almost all farmers used DAP or urea, and 73% used both. None
of the farmers used K-containing fertilizer (Table 1). Timing of
basal fertilizer application was on average 26, 33, and 26 days after
sowing (DAS) in 2011WS, 2012DS, and 2013DS, respectively,
whereas timing of ﬁrst top-dressing of N on average for each

season was 59–61 DAS (Table 1). Only in 2012DS did some farmers
(9%; Table 1) apply N as second top-dressing (at 76 DAS on aver-
age; data not shown) (none of the farmers applied it in the other
seasons). Total N application rates were similar between 2011WS
and 2012DS, both higher than in 2013DS (Table 1). P2O5 applica-
tion rate was highest in 2011WS. Rice yields were 6.4, 6.4, and
5.1 t/ha in 2011WS, 2012DS, and 2013DS, respectively (Table 1).
In 2011WS, actual rice yield was much higher than previous yield
reported by farmers before the season, which could indicate that
the rice-growing environment was particularly favorable in this
season. For the dry seasons, actual yield was on average lower than
the previous season.

3.2. Fertilizer recommendation by Nutrient Manager for Rice and rice
yields

Target yields on average were set to 6.4, 7.9, and 7.1 t/ha in
2011WS, 2012DS, and 2013DS, respectively (Table 1). In all the
seasons, all the plots with NMR (except for plots with compound
fertilizer in 2013DS) received DAP as basal (on average 21, 23,
and 14 DAS in 2011WS, 2012DS, and 2013DS, respectively) and
at least two top-dressings of N, at mid-tillering stage (35, 38, and
31 DAS) and panicle initiation stage (on average 49, 52, and 46
DAS; data not shown). Similarly, 20%, 97%, and 46% of the plots
received a third top-dressing at around booting stage (on average
88, 75, and 75 DAS; data not shown). Twenty, 100, and 71% of
the plots received KCl fertilizer. The total of N, P2O5, and K2O appli-
cation rates (kg/ha) were higher in the dry seasons than in the wet
season, mainly because the target yields were higher in the dry
season (Table 1). Although the target yields differed between the
two dry seasons, total N application rates were not largely differ-
ent. This is because we modiﬁed the formula for the relationship
between GY and GY0N in NMR between the two seasons by includ-
ing additional data. For KCl application, K2O-equivalent application
rates differed between the two dry seasons, which could be due to
differences in target yields and residue management practices (see
Fig. 5). Average yields obtained in NMR were 8.7, 7.6, 6.1, and
6.4 t/ha in 2011WS, 2012DS, and plots with KCl and with com-
pound fertilizer (9–23–30) in 2013DS, respectively (Table 1).
There was no signiﬁcant difference in yield between plots with
KCl and those with compound fertilizer. Difference in K2O fertilizer
rate between two treatments ranged from 13 to 51 kg/ha across all
the farmers’ ﬁelds. Yield difference between the two treatments
were not correlated with difference in K2O fertilizer (r = 0.014,
P > 0.05).

Averaged over 102 plots over three seasons, actual yields
obtained in NMR were similar to target yield for the NMR recom-
mendation (7.3 vs. 7.3 t/ha; data not shown). However, differences

In the 2013DS,

between actual yield obtained in NMR and target yield for NMR
recommendation were 2.3 and  0.1 t/ha in 2011WS and 2012DS,
the difference was  0.9 and
respectively.
 0.6 t/ha for plots with KCl and compound fertilizer, respectively.
There was also large variation in the difference across ﬁelds in each
year (Fig. 6). In 31% of the plots, actual yields were within ±10% of
target yields. In 2011WS, the difference was negatively related to
sowing date (the difference between actual yield and target
yield =  0.06  days of year + 17.7; r =  0.54, P < 0.05). The ‘‘day
of year’’ ignores the existence of months and numbers each day
of the year consecutively. A regression coefﬁcient of  0.06 indi-
cates that the difference was reduced by 0.06 t/ha as sowing was
delayed by 1 day. There was no signiﬁcant relationship between
the difference and sowing date in the two dry seasons (data not
shown).

3.3. Difference in yield and proﬁtability between plots with NMR and
FFP

On average in each season, rice yield and proﬁtability with NMR
were consistently higher than those in FFP across three seasons

(Table 1). Distribution of increase in rice yield in NMR compared to
FFP is shown in Fig. 7. The probability of achieving an increase in
yield as a result of introduction of NMR was 86%. Yield increase
of >1 t/ha was observed in 56% of the plots. This increase was
weakly and negatively related to yields in FFP (yield difference
between NMR and FFP =  0.17  yield in FFP + 2.5; r =  0.21,
P < 0.05). This was also the case for proﬁtability (difference in prof-
itability = 26,630  yield in FFP + 297243; r =  0.25, P < 0.01). On
average, N–P2O5–K2O application rates were 137–46–46 and
156–30–0 kg/ha in NMR and FFP, respectively. A combination of
delayed basal fertilizer application and ﬁrst top-dress of N, smaller
number of N top-dressings, and no K application in FFP are likely to
have resulted in lower yields in FFP compared to NMR (Table 1).

4. Discussion

This paper describes a framework of NMR for the Senegal River
valley, and results of testing of
it over three seasons. NMR
out-yielded FFP and increased proﬁtability in a wide range of farm-
ers’ yield levels across both wet and dry seasons. The advantage of
NMR was weakly and negatively correlated with yield in FFP, sug-
gesting that NMR is better for lower-yielding ﬁelds than for
higher-yielding ﬁelds. However, regression lines between differ-
ences in yield and proﬁtability between NMR and FFP, and yield
in FFP indicate that NMR will not result in lower yield and prof-
itability in high-yielding farmers’ ﬁelds. Yield increase due to intro-
duction of NMR observed in this study is consistent with previous
studies in the SRV (Haefele et al., 2000, 2001), which showed that
improved nutrient management increased yields by about 1 t/ha in
farmers’ ﬁelds. Yield increase is mainly due to the fact that farmers’
timings of N fertilizer application did not coincide with critical
growth stages of rice. Wopereis et al. (1999) suggest that delayed
application result in low recovery rates of fertilizer N in the rice
crop. We observed that farmers’ fertilizer practices, especially
delayed fertilizer
of N
top-dressings, have changed little since the 1990s, although the
total amount of N fertilizer applied had increased (cf. Wopereis
et al., 1999).

and number

In this study, experimental design and treatments tested did
not allow us to separate out the contribution of K and other ele-
ments in producing higher yield beyond farmers’ yield level. In this

study, K was applied in farmers’ ﬁelds with high target yield, espe-
cially where short stubble was retained from the previous crop, by
using a partial maintenance approach (Fig. 5). In 2013DS, two K2O
fertilizer rates were compared. Plots with higher K2O fertilizer
showed small yield advantage (on average 0.3 t/ha), although there
was no statistical difference in yield between the K2O rates. K2O
fertilizer application has not been recommended in this area.
However, Haefele and Wopereis (2004) suggest that in case of dou-
ble cropping targeting high yield with straw removal, K application
is needed as input/output balance becomes more negative. Average
yield has been increasing in farmers’ ﬁelds since the 1990s in
statistics reported by SAED (2013), as well as in comparison
between Wopereis et al. (1999) and this study. Also, double crop-
ping is becoming common and straw is used as animal feed in this
area. Thus, K deﬁciency might have constrained rice yields in the
ﬁelds where such practices were recently adopted. Indigenous
nutrient supplies in relation to cropping pattern, residue manage-
ment practices, and yield level should be investigated in this area
for further improving NMR.

A previous study in the SRV (Haefele and Wopereis, 2004)
developed decision-support systems with special attention to N
fertilizer application rate.
In Fig. 3, three data points from
Haefele and Wopereis (2004) are shown. The N fertilizer applica-
tion rate in their study was higher than the rate used for NMR at
the same target yield. The reason for this difference is the different
approaches used to determine N fertilizer requirement. In the
Haefele and Wopereis (2004) study, the relation between plant N
uptake and yield, 45% N fertilizer recovery rate, ﬁxed indigenous
N supply (at 39 kg N/ha), and target yield were used to determine
N fertilizer requirement, while our study used the simple regres-
sion shown in the Material and methods section and indigenous
N supply depends on target yield (as shown in Fig. 2). As our study
demonstrated that, on average across all the trials, target yield and
actual yield were similar, the higher fertilizer application rates sug-
gested by Haefele and Wopereis (2004) do not seem to be neces-
sary. Haefele and Wopereis (2004) determined P2O5 fertilizer rate
of 46–57 kg/ha empirically based on long-term trials to maintain
soil P level (Haefele et al., 2002). This is similar to the average rate
determined by NMR.

Although on average target yield and actual yield in NMR were
similar, there was large variation in difference between them
(Fig. 6). As we did not collect data on farmers’ crop management
practices (except for sowing dates and varieties) or biophysical
information such as soil nutrient supply and salinity, we cannot
identify the factors that effected such large variation in the differ-
ence. However, they are likely to be a combination of weather con-
ditions, indigenous N supply, abiotic stress such as salinity, and
crop management practices. It has been repeatedly reported that
indigenous N supply and optimal N rates for rice vary widely from
year to year, as they are also affected by weather conditions, which
determine potential yield (e.g. Dobermann et al., 2002, 2003a).
Also, there were large variations in indigenous N supply and crop
response to N fertilizer among rice ﬁelds in the same region (e.g.
Wopereis et al., 1999; Dobermann et al., 2003a). Yield without N
fertilizer (GY0N), which is a proxy for indigenous N supply, in the
SRV in Senegal varied widely (Fig. 2), ranging from 1.3 to
5.6 t/ha. In this study, we used one simple regression curve for
determining the relationship between target yield (GY) (t/ha) and
yield without N fertilizer (GY0N) (Fig. 2). In fact, there is large vari-
ation in this relationship, and simple regression is not enough to
estimate GY0N for determining N fertilizer requirement. To exam-
ine variation in N fertilizer requirement in relation to the relation-
ship between GY and GY0N, data with GY0N per GY of at least 0.6
(referring to low N deﬁciency) and at most 0.5 (referring to high
N deﬁciency) in Fig. 2 were used for developing regression curves
and determining N fertilizer requirements. Fig. 8 shows three

5. Conclusions

NMR offers a new approach to increasing the yield of irrigated
lowland rice and proﬁtability in farmers’ ﬁelds in the SRV.
However, systematic approaches through compiling ﬁeld charac-
teristics and farmers’ feedback are needed for further ﬁne-tuning
of NMR. Introduction of in-season N adjustment could help reduce
N input in slightly N-deﬁcient ﬁelds/seasons, and increase N input
in highly N-deﬁcient ﬁelds/seasons. When NMR is introduced, it is
essential to disseminate integrated crop management practices to
farmers along with it to reduce any potential obstacles which can
reduce fertilizer use efﬁciency.

regressions between target yield and N fertilizer requirement, the
middle one was used for this study. In highly N-deﬁcient ﬁelds,
more N fertilizer is needed to achieve same target yield level than
in slightly N-deﬁcient ﬁelds. Where target yield is 6 t/ha, N fertil-
izer requirement ranged from 92 (slightly N-deﬁcient ﬁelds) to
152 kg/ha
variation in
N-deﬁciency level among the ﬁelds tested in this study could cause
large variation in difference between target yield and actual yield.
As it is not feasible to measure N-deﬁciency level in each farmer’s
ﬁeld and there is year-to-year variation in indigenous N supply,
in-season adjustment of N fertilizer application according to crop
N status (e.g. leaf color chart) would help increase N fertilizer rate
in highly N-deﬁcient ﬁelds, and reduce N application in slightly
N-deﬁcient ﬁelds (Balasubramaiam et al., 1999; Yang et al.,
2003). Such an approach could be incorporated into NMR for the
SRV.

Thus,

Lower actual yields than target yields in this study could also be
due to poor crop management practices. We found a negative rela-
tionship between sowing date and yield difference between actual
and target yields in 2011WS. It has been frequently suggested that
delayed sowing in the SRV risks cold-induced spikelet sterility
(Dingkuhn, 1995; Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997; Wopereis et al.,
1999). Thus, to achieve high yield using NMR, it is essential to
sow within the recommended window. Also, since we did not
record detailed information on crop management practices, poor
crop management practices for land preparation, crop establish-
ment, and weed management might also have resulted in lower
yield (Haefele et al., 2000, 2001; Poussin et al., 2003). Haefele
et al. (2000, 2001) report that improved weed management prac-
tices resulted in yield increase of about 1 t/ha in the SRV. Salinity
– a major constraint to rice production in the Senegal River delta
(Häfele et al., 1999) – might also contribute to lower actual yields
than target yields.

As the cause of difference between target yield and actual yield
is a complex issue and a combination of a number of factors, fur-
ther research is needed to understand these factors and interac-
tions among them for optimizing fertilizer recommendations.
However, it is clear that when NMR is introduced, efforts are
needed to simultaneously introduce integrated crop management
practices to farmers, so that farmers can avoid poor practices
and/or alleviate constraints, and will get higher N fertilizer recov-
ery and consequently higher yield.
