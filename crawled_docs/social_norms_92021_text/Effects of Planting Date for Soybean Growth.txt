Abstract: As ﬂuctuating commodity prices change the agriculture landscape on a yearly basis,
soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) has become the predominant crop in the southern USA, accounting
for 65 percent of the total row crop production in the state. To accommodate increased soybean
production, planting dates have expanded, spanning from late March through July. To determine
the impact of this expanded planting window on soybean development and yield, ﬁeld experiments
were conducted at Starkville and Stoneville, MS, in 2013 and 2014. Treatments included seven
planting dates ranging from 25 March to 15 July and two soybean cultivars (one Maturity Group
IV and one Maturity Group V cultivar). These studies were conducted in irrigated high—-yielding
environments. Experimental units were sampled weekly for insect pests and insecticides were applied
when populations exceeded the levels at which applications were recommended. Planting date had a
signiﬁcant impact on crop development, plant height, canopy closure, and yield. As planting date
was delayed, the time required for crop development decreased from 122 total days for plantings on
25 March to 83 days for plantings on 15 July. For plantings after 2 June, plant height decreased by
1.1 cm per day. Canopy closure decreased by 1.01% per day after 27 May. Soybean yield decreased
26.7 kg/ha per day when soybean was planted after 20 April. This research demonstrates the
importance of early planting dates for soybean producers in the southern US to ensure proﬁtability
by maximizing yield potential.

1. Introduction

Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), is one of the most important commodities worldwide, and is
planted on over 6% of land dedicated to agriculture [1]. Soybean seeds are used in a variety of
ways, from protein meal to feeding livestock to vegetable oil. Soybean production increased from
approximately 17 million metric tons in 1960 to 230 million metric tons by 2008 [1]. Multiple factors
have inﬂuenced this increase, including higher yield potential from breeding and major changes in
management strategies.

Soybean production has increased in the southern USA, from 4.8 million hectares in 2006 to
5.9 million hectares in 2014 [2]. This change is largely due to commodity prices ﬂuctuating on a

yearly basis. With soybean being planted on 45% of the area dedicated to agronomic crop production,
it has become a major commodity in this region [2]. This increase in production has resulted in
soybean being planted over a wider period (late March to late June) compared to the early 2000s, when
plantings typically occurred from early April to mid–May, but some plantings were made in June for
double–cropping situations.

In the early 2000s, the Early Soybean Production System (ESPS) was introduced into the southern
region of the USA as a way to increase yield potential. Recommended practices for the ESPS include
planting Maturity Group IV or early–maturity Group V soybean cultivars from late March through late
April [3]. Prior to these recommendations, growers planted late–maturity Group V and maturity Group
VI soybean cultivars during May and later [3]. The ESPS was developed as a method to avoid drought
and high temperatures during the reproductive stages, which can stress soybean crops and decrease
yield potential [4]. Currently, growers plant the same maturity groups throughout the entire planting
window. In 2003, 36% of the soybean crop across the mid–southern states of Arkansas, Louisiana,
and Mississippi was planted before 1 May, 28% between 1 May to 1 June, and 36% after 31 May [3].
Not only does the ESPS provide for greater yield potential, but it can also aid in weed control and
insect pest management [5,6].

With grain hectares in the region increasing in the past decade, it has become more diﬃcult to
plant all the soybean hectares on large farms in an early window. Most growers utilize the same
equipment to harvest soybean, corn (Zea mays L.), and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench).
When soybeans remain in the ﬁeld for extended periods of time after reaching maturity, it is common
for pods to shatter, resulting in yield loss [7]. Many growers now utilize planting date and maturity
level to manage timely harvest of their crops and to plan for the crops maturing at diﬀerent intervals to
minimize in–ﬁeld yield loss, and as a plan for harvest equipment eﬃciency. However, growers are still
predominately utilizing indeterminate–maturity Group IV and V soybean cultivars.

Because planting dates for soybean range from late March through mid–June, knowing the yield
potential of soybean based on planting date alone, and how planting date aﬀects other agronomic
aspects of soybean production, such as days to maturity, plant height, and canopy closure is important.
The objective of this study was to determine the impact of planting date on days to multiple growth
stages, plant heights, canopy closure, and yield, and to narrow down the planting window within
which when soybean growth and development is optimal in order to maximize yield potential.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Location and Site Descriptions

Soybeans were planted on seven dates at the R.R. Foil Experiment Station in Starkville, MS and the
Delta Research and Extension Center in Stoneville, MS in 2013 and 2014 to evaluate how planting date
aﬀected plant development and yield. The experiment was arranged as a split plot within a randomized
complete block design. A split–plot design was used to manage harvest within each planting date.
The main–plot factor was planting date. Planting dates ranged from the third week of March to
the second week of July, with approximately two to three weeks between each planting (Table 1).
The subplot factor was cultivar. At each planting date, two diﬀerent indeterminate cultivars, a Maturity
Group IV cultivar (Asgrow® 4632, Monsanto Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) and a Maturity Group V
cultivar (Asgrow® 5332, Monsanto Company, St. Louis, MO, USA) were planted at each location to
represent the most common maturity groups planted in Mississippi. Soybean seed at all plantings
were treated with the Acceleron® seed treatment package (Monsanto Company, St. Louis, MO, USA),
consisting of pyraclostrobin, metalaxyl, and ﬂuxapyroxad fungicides and imidicloprid insecticide.

Subplot were four rows wide by 4.3 m long, with a row width of 0.96 m in Starkville and 1.01 m
in Stoneville, and were planted at density of 44,515 seeds per hectare. There were four replications
for each planting date and cultivar per location. Both locations used conventional tillage practices.
Conventional tillage practices consisted of disking in the fall and bed preparation in the early spring
for furrow irrigation. A foliar application of azoxystrobin (Quadris®, Syngenta Crop Protection,
Greensboro, NC, USA) at 0.1 kg ai/ha was applied to all experimental units at the R3 growth stage.
The soil type at the Starkville location was a Marietta ﬁne sandy loam (Fine–loamy, siliceous, active,
thermic Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts) and a Bosket very ﬁne sandy loam (Fine–loamy, mixed, active,
thermic Mollic Hapludalfs) at the Stoneville location. Both locations were fertilized based on soil
tests conducted the previous fall. No fertilizer was needed in either year in the Starkville location but
P2O5 at 45 kg/ha and K2O at 67 kg/ha was applied in the Stoneville location both years. Irrigation
practices at both locations consisted of furrow irrigation. Each irrigation event lasted until water
reached the tail–ditch on all rows, approximately 0.01 hectare meters of water, and were irrigated
weekly from the R1 through R6 growth stages. All experimental units were treated for insects based
on action threshold recommendations in the Insect Control Guide for Agronomic Crops [8] published
by the Mississippi State University Extension Service. The only pests that reached action thresholds
were a complex of stink bugs consisting of green stink bug (Acrosternum hilare, Say), southern green
stink bug (Nezara viridula, L.), and brown stink bug (Eushistus servus, Say), along with soybean looper
(Chrysodeixis includens, Walker) and bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcate, Forster).

2.2. Measurements

Insect densities were measured weekly by conducting 25 sweeps per experimental unit using a
standard 38.1 cm diameter sweep net from the R1 (ﬁrst ﬂower) through the R7 (ﬁrst brown pod) growth
stages [9]. Growth stages were recorded weekly from the R1 growth stage until the R7 growth stage.
Final plant heights were recorded at the R6 (pod containing full size green beans) growth stage [9],
using rulers to measure the length between the base of the plant to the highest node on the plant.
Canopy closure was also recorded on the same day as plant heights by measuring average centimeters
of open canopy between rows at ten locations per experimental unit, and then converting this number
to a percentage of closed canopy based on row spacing. Days to emergence were measured based on
daily visual observations, starting every day after planting until soybeans reached cotyledon growth
stage. Experimental units were harvested independently by planting date and cultivar at the R8 growth
stage when moisture content was approximately 13%, using a two row Kincaid (Massey Ferguson)
8XP plot combine, equipped with a 6 foot platform header and data collection system that tested for
seed moisture and test weight of each individual experimental unit. To calculate yield, moisture for all
experimental units was corrected to 13%.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

4 of 11

Data for days to emergence, R1, and R7 were analyzed with analysis of variance (PROC GLIMMIX.
Version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Fixed eﬀects were planting date, maturity group, and
the interaction between planting date and maturity group. Random eﬀects included site–year (location
by year), replication nested within site–year, replication by planting date nested within site–year, and
replication by planting date by maturity group nested within site–year. Mean separations were based
on Fisher’s protected LSD (least signiﬁcant diﬀerence) with an alpha level of 0.05. Data for plant
heights, percent canopy closure, and yield were analyzed using piecewise regression analysis [10]
in PROC GLIMMIX so that a random statement that included site–year, replication nested within
site–year, replication by maturity group nested within site–year, and replication by planting date by
maturity group nested within site–year, could be utilized. With piecewise regression, two slopes were
produced along with an exact breakpoint of where the slopes changed. Piecewise regression was
chosen over other regression models because it was the best ﬁt, although other models were considered
in preliminary analysis. For ﬁnal plant heights, percent canopy closure, and yields, there was no
signiﬁcant eﬀect for cultivar or interaction between planting date and cultivar for total insect pests
(p = 0.35), plant heights (p = 0.21), canopy closure (p = 0.84), or yield (p = 0.86); therefore, data were
pooled across cultivars at each planting date. In both years and at both sites, all dependent variables
responded similarly; therefore, data were pooled across years and sites and were considered random
(site–year). No eﬀect of cultivar was observed for any year or planting date for any of the measurement
taken; therefore, all analysis was pooled across cultivars for each planting date and year. For all data,
planting date is represented by the Julian date for the date of planting. Additionally, the correlation
between all of the dependent variables measured and soybean yields were determined (PROC CORR,
Version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

The ﬁrst plantings in both 2013 (Stoneville) and 2014 (Starkville) (Julian day 80–98) had less than
suﬃcient plant densities due to cold temperatures and moisture, whereas Maturity Group V plots for
the last planting date (Julian day 196–197) did not have suﬃcient soil moisture following planting,
leading to poor emergence and insuﬃcient plant density during 2014 (Stoneville). Observations for
these planting dates were excluded from all analyses. Experimental units for all other planting dates
had plant densities that ranged from 37,200 (85% of the seeding rate) plants per hectare to 41,800
(95% of the seeding rate) plants per hectare, which were deemed suﬃcient for the experiments.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Planting Date Eﬀects on Insect Pressure

Diﬀerences were observed for total insect pests based on planting date (p < 0.01). The early July
(Julian day 181) and mid–July (Julian day 196) plantings received signiﬁcantly higher densities of total
insect pests compared to all other plantings (Figure 1). Of the insect pests reaching action thresholds,
the stink bug complex received the most threshold applications. Stink bugs reached action thresholds
in all plantings except the mid–April (Julian day 105) and mid–May (Julian day 128) plantings. Soybean
looper and bean leaf beetle were only at action threshold densities for plantings starting in early June
(Julian day 150).

3.2. Planting Date Eﬀects on Growth Stage

The number of days to selected growth stages varied among the seven planting dates in this study.
Diﬀerences were observed for emergence (p < 0.01), vegetative period (p = 0.01), and reproductive
period (p < 0.01) among planting dates. Soybeans planted before mid–May (Julian Day 132) took longer
to emerge than soybeans planted after that time (Table 2). A similar trend was observed for the number
of days until the vegetative period, where the signiﬁcant change in days until the vegetative period did
not occur until soybeans were planted in mid–May (Julian Day 132), although the early June (Julian
Day 155) planting did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from any planting date. Plantings in mid–March (Julian
Day 80) took signiﬁcantly more days to reach the reproductive period compared to all other plantings
(Table 3). Signiﬁcantly fewer days to reach the reproductive period were observed for the early July
(Julian Day 181) and mid–July (Julian Day 196) plantings compared to all other plantings (Table 2).

Planting Date Effects on Growth Stage The number of days to selected growth stages varied among the seven planting dates in this study. Differences were observed for emergence (p < 0.01), vegetative period (p = 0.01), and reproductive period (p < 0.01) among planting dates. Soybeans planted before mid–May (Julian Day 132) took longer to emerge than soybeans planted after that time (Table 2). A similar trend was observed for the number of days until the vegetative period, where the significant change in days until the vegetative period did not occur until soybeans were planted in mid–May (Julian Day 132), although the early June (Julian Day 155) planting did not significantly differ from any planting date. Plantings in mid–March (Julian Day 80) took significantly more days to reach the reproductive period compared to all other plantings (Table 3). Significantly fewer days to reach the reproductive period were observed for the early July (Julian Day 181) and mid–July (Julian Day 196) plantings compared to all other plantings (Table 2).

3.3. Planting Date Eﬀects on Plant Height

Final plant heights ranged from 38.1 cm to 142.2 cm with an average height of 83.8 cm. A relationship
was observed between planting date and plant height (Table 3). Based on the piecewise regression,
a change in slope was observed for the early June plantings (Julian Day 153), with soybeans planted on
this date achieving the greatest plant height (Figure 2). For planting dates from 25 March (Julian Day 84)
to 2 June (Julian Day 153), plant heights increased by 0.3 (± 0.1) cm per day. For planting dates from
2 June (Julian Day 153) to 16 July (Julian Day 197), plant heights decreased by 2.7 (± 0.2) cm per day.

Figure 2. Piecewise regression for plant height by Julian days. The equation for the portion before the
break point was y = 0.14x (± 0.01) + 20.35 (± 1.62) with a p–value of <0.01. The equation for the portion
after the break point was y = −0.44x (± 0.01) + 109.59 (± 2.35) with a p–value of <0.01. The break point
between the two slopes was 153 Julian days.

Planting Date Effects on Canopy Closure Percent canopy closure ranged from 100% closed canopy to 31.6% closed canopy with an average of 75.2%. A relationship was observed between planting date and percent canopy closure (Table 3). Based on the piecewise regression, a change in the slope occurred at the late May (Julian Day 147) planting date, with percent canopy closure decreasing at later planting dates (Figure 3). Peak percent canopy closure occurred for the 25 March (Julian Day 84) plantings. For planting dates from 25 March (Julian Day 84) to 27 May (Julian Day 147), percent canopy closure decreased by 0.1% (± 0.1%) per day, but percent canopy closure decreased by 1.0% (± 0.1%) per day for planting dates after 27 May (Julian Day 147). Early planting dates resulted in nearly complete canopy closure by R5, while canopy closure for soybean planted after 27 May (Julian Day 147) never exceeded 89% canopy closure.  Agronomy 2020, 10, 596

3.4. Planting Date Eﬀects on Canopy Closure

Percent canopy closure ranged from 100% closed canopy to 31.6% closed canopy with an average
of 75.2%. A relationship was observed between planting date and percent canopy closure (Table 3).
Based on the piecewise regression, a change in the slope occurred at the late May (Julian Day 147)
planting date, with percent canopy closure decreasing at later planting dates (Figure 3). Peak percent
canopy closure occurred for the 25 March (Julian Day 84) plantings. For planting dates from 25 March
(Julian Day 84) to 27 May (Julian Day 147), percent canopy closure decreased by 0.1% (± 0.1%) per day,
but percent canopy closure decreased by 1.0% (± 0.1%) per day for planting dates after 27 May (Julian
Day 147). Early planting dates resulted in nearly complete canopy closure by R5, while canopy closure
for soybean planted after 27 May (Julian Day 147) never exceeded 89% canopy closure.

Figure 3. Piecewise regression for percent canopy closure. The equation for the portion before the break
point was y = −0.07x (± 0.02) + 99.89 (± 1.85) with a p–value of <0.01. The equation for the portion
after the break point was y = −1.01x (± 0.02) + 239.54 (± 5.97) with a p–value of <0.01. The break point
was 147 Julian days.

3.5. Planting Date Eﬀects on Yield

Yield ranged from 6321 kg/ha to 1372 kg/ha with an average yield of 3564 kg/ha. A signiﬁcant
relationship was observed between planting date and yield (Table 3). Based on the piecewise regression,
a change in slope was observed after mid–April plantings (Julian Day 110), the planting date where
yield was maximized (Figure 4). For planting dates from 25 March (Julian Day 84) to 20 April (Julian
Day 110), yield increased by 34.3 (± 6.7) kg/ha per day, while yield decreased by 26.6 (± 1.9) kg/ha per
day for planting dates from 20 April (Julian Day 110) to 16 July (Julian Day 197).

3.6. Plant Height, Canopy Closure, Days to Growth Stages, and Insect Pressure Impact on Yield

Plant heights, canopy closure, days to growth stages, and insect pressure all had a signiﬁcant
(p < 0.01) positive correlation with soybean yield except total insects, which had a signiﬁcant (p < 0.01)
negative correlation with soybean yield. In general, yields were greater with greater days to plant
emergence (r = 0.29), greater days to R1 (r = 0.49), greater days to R7 (r = 0.57), greater percentage
of canopy closure (r = 0.57), and greater plant heights (r = 0.40). In terms of plant height, lodging
occurred with the tallest plants in some situations and yields could have been negatively impacted
when that occurred. Yields were negatively impacted with greater insect pressure (r = −0.41). These
results suggest that all of these factors are important for maximizing soybean yields, but no single
factor was strongly correlated with yield based on the correlation coeﬃcients. This is most likely
because relationships between all factors and yield were not linear.

4. Recommendations for Soybean Production Based on Planting Date

The data from the studies conducted in 2013 and 2014 are consistent with multiple studies
indicating that as planting is delayed, the developmental time of soybean crops is more rapid,
potentially impacting plant height, canopy closure, and yield [11–14]. With increased developmental
time, plant heights can increase leading to a greater chance of lodging [15]. Canopy closure is also
highly dependent on developmental time; without the proper amount of time, the canopy will not
fully close, which can hinder photosynthesis and in turn decrease yield. Yield is directly impacted by
both canopy closure and plant height, and without adequate developmental time, yield potential will
decrease in soybean crops [11,14,15].

The equation for the portion before the break point was y = 0.51x (± 0.09) + 16.74 (± 12.81) with a p–value of <0.01. The equation for the portion after the break point was y = −0.39 (± 0.03) + 114.67 (± 6.28) with a p–value of 0.03. The break point was 110 Julian days. 3.6. Plant Height, Canopy Closure, Days to Growth Stages, and Insect Pressure Impact on Yield Plant heights, canopy closure, days to growth stages, and insect pressure all had a significant (p < 0.01) positive correlation with soybean yield except total insects, which had a significant (p < 0.01) negative correlation with soybean yield. In general, yields were greater with greater days to plant emergence (r = 0.29), greater days to R1 (r = 0.49), greater days to R7 (r = 0.57), greater percentage of canopy closure (r = 0.57), and greater plant heights (r = 0.40). In terms of plant height, lodging occurred with the tallest plants in some situations and yields could have been negatively impacted when that occurred. Yields were negatively impacted with greater insect pressure (r = −0.41). These results suggest that all of these factors are important for maximizing soybean yields, but no single factor was strongly correlated with yield based on the correlation coefficients. This is most likely because relationships between all factors and yield were not linear. 4.

Plant height increases with planting date when soybeans are planted early, but starts to decrease
with plantings after early June. Previous research indicated a similar response in that soybean plants
planted in June reached a greater plant height when compared to those planted before June, resulting
in greater lodging [16,17]. The day length and temperature for early plantings and late plantings diﬀer
greatly and ﬁnal plant heights may be aﬀected by these factors [12].

Lodging was only observed in plantings between mid–May and mid–June, which could potentially
cause direct yield losses. Lodging was due in large part to the height the plants reached, which
ampliﬁed the eﬀect that wind had on the plants. After the experiment was conducted, it was discovered
that the Asgrow® 5332 cultivar is prone to lodging, but the same amount of lodging was observed in
the Asgrow® 4632 cultivar. Growers should try to plant early in the planting window to avoid these
losses, or choose cultivars with less vegetative growth potential when planting in this window.

Canopy closure was not aﬀected by planting date until soybeans were planted after late May.
Taylor [18] observed that a fully closed canopy can help maximize photosynthesis. Furthermore, a
fully closed canopy can aid in weed control due to reduced sunlight reaching the soil surface [6]. This
may assist with the management of herbicide–resistant weeds that are common in the mid–South.
Nordby [19] reported lower Amaranthus palmeri L. densities in soybean with closed canopies compared
to those with more open canopies. Knowing this, and the current state of resistant weed control issues
throughout Mississippi, early plantings of soybean where the canopy reaches full closure will aid in
controlling resistant weed populations. As the canopy closes, it blocks sunlight from reaching the soil
surface, which in turn can prevent or inhibit the emergence and growth of these problematic weeds [6].
The lack of complete canopy closure in late plantings could be attributed to less time being
available for vegetative growth. Similar results have been observed where later planted soybean
required fewer total days to reach maturity [13]. The fewer days for soybean plants planted later to
reach maturity can be attributed to the shortening of day length throughout the growing season. In a
similar study, Egli and Bruening [20] observed that May plantings of soybean resulted in more biomass
than those that were planted in June. Yield is the most important factor to a soybean farmer and was
also highly aﬀected by planting date. After 20 April, growers start to lose yield potential, which directly
aﬀects their potential proﬁt for the growing season. This becomes an even greater factor in times where
commodity prices are in decline and the cost of growing soybean is increasing. In this two–year study,
yield was maximized on 20 April. These experiments were conducted in intensively managed, irrigated
growing environments, and results may not be representative for other environments. In regions
without irrigation, or with limited rainfall, planting date could have an even larger impact on yield
potential of soybean [21]. The increase in yield for the earlier plantings was most likely due to optimal
growing conditions with cooler temperatures, compared to later plantings with high temperatures and
little rainfall. With that being said, results from the 2013 and 2014 experiments were similar to those
from studies conducted in Oklahoma during 2009 and 2010, where plantings before mid–May resulted
in greater yields than later plantings (after mid–May) of soybean [22]. In regional analyses across the
mid–southern portion of the United States, soybeans planted after early–May had signiﬁcantly lower
yields than soybeans planted before early May [20,23]. Early plantings can result in weed suppression
and can decrease the likelihood of large insect infestations. Similarly to our results, observations have
been made in the mid–South that late plantings of soybean received large densities of multiple insect
pests [24,25]. Studies have also shown early plantings of soybean acting as harbors for stink bug [26,27],
similar to results observed in the current study.

Seed quality was not measured in this study, but it is common to see a decrease in quality as
soybeans are planted later due to adverse rainfall in the late reproductive stages, and potentially from
late–season stink bug feeding. Soybeans planted too early or too late may be negatively impacted by
environmental conditions that are not ideal for quality stand emergence. This was observed in the
current study where poor seedling emergence was observed for the ﬁrst planting date at two site–years
and for the last planting date at one site–year. These data suggest that the optimum planting dates
for soybean in Mississippi are between 10 April and 1 May, and that this planting window will help

with all aspects of soybean agronomics, including stand quality, plant heights, canopy closure, insect
pressure, and maximizing yield.
