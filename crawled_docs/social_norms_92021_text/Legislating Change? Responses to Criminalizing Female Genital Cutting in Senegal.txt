Although the international community has recently promoted legislation as an
important reform strategy for ending female genital cutting (FGC), there exist
divergent views on its potential effects. Supporters argue that legal prohibition
of FGC has a general deterrent effect, while others argue legislation can be

perceived as coercive, and derail local efforts to end the practice. This study
examines the range of responses observed in rural Senegal, where a 1999
anti-FGC law was imposed on communities in which the practice was being
actively contested and targeted for elimination. Drawing on data from a
mixed-methods study, we analyze responses in relation to two leading theories
on social regulation, the law and economics and law and society paradigms,
which make divergent predictions on the interplay between social norms and
legal norms. Among supporters of FGC, legal norms ran counter to social
norms, and did little to deter the practice, and in some instances incited

reactance or drove the practice underground. Conversely, where FGC was
being contested, legislation served to strengthen the stance of those contem-
plating or favoring abandonment. We conclude that legislation can comple-
ment other reform strategies by creating an “enabling environment” that
supports those who have or wish to abandon FGC.

Women held in Beijing in 1995, then U.S. First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton declared in a keynote address that, “it is a viola-

and degrading practice of genital mutilation” (http://www.youtube

before several international bodies, and in April 1998 she traveled
to Senegal to praise men and women who “come together to stand
against and speak out against a key ancient custom” (quoted in
Hecht 1999). Ten months later, in the wake of active debate among
Senegal’s parliamentarians, legal scholars, religious leaders, as well
as some local anti-FGM (female genital mutilation) activists and
program leaders, parliament enacted legislation that makes it a

crime to carry out “female genital mutilation” or to encourage
anybody else to do so.2 International media drew attention to the
fact that this law was passed just one month before the release of the
American State Department’s Annual Report on Human Rights
(e.g.,
1999; Hecht 1999), arguing that this report is used
as a guide for Congress and U.S. agencies in allocating foreign

1 Mrs. Clinton was referring speciﬁcally to female genital mutilation (FGM), also
known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). These terms are often used
to describe a variety of procedures for altering the external female genitalia. The choice of
terminology conveys important connotations, and has therefore been the subject of
ongoing debate. Many commentators initially used the term “female circumcision” as it
reﬂects the fact that in some societies genital cutting is incorporated into both male and
female initiation rites, and in some local languages is described by the same term. In the
1970s, the term “female genital mutilation” was advanced by activists who felt that the term
“female circumcision” deemphasized the severity of certain forms of the practice, and
implied, incorrectly, that all forms are analogous to male circumcision. Some African groups
objected to the use of the term “mutilation” since it is judgmental and derogatory, and

instead advanced the more neutral term “female genital cutting” (Eliah 1996). UNICEF
and UNFPA currently favor a hybrid term, female genital mutilation/cutting or FGM/C, to
capture the signiﬁcance of the term “mutilation” at the policy level and, at the same time,
when working with practicing communities, recognizing the importance of employing
nonjudgmental terminology to avoid alienation (UNICEF 2005). Because we are discussing
both policy and cultural context, we have also chosen to use the hybrid term FGM/C, and
use the term FGM when discussing activism and legislation.

from the United States,
implemented the law “only to please
American sensitivities” (1999). The passage of the Senegalese anti-
FGM law was thus portrayed as an imposition of Western values on
an African nation, overlooking the long history of debate on female
genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) among Senegalese intellectuals
and the leadership of Senegal in the international human rights
movement.3

Although media reports
 
 
 
 
 

the internal
debates in Senegalese society, they captured the centerpiece of
these debates by posing the question, “Is it a crime or is it
culture?” (
1999). The enactment of the law did, in fact,
create a formal legal system for regulating FGM/C that was at odds
with the cultural values in a minority of Senegalese communities
with long-standing histories of practicing FGM/C. In doing so,
Senegal joined a growing number of African nations that have
adopted legislation as a reform strategy for ending FGM/C. In the
background of
these events lies an unanswered question: Is
legislation an effective tool for ending the practice of FGM/C?
Divergent views have been forwarded. On one hand, some com-
mentators and activists believe that legal prohibition will accelerate
abandonment of the practice, while others argue that such a top-
down approach can be perceived as coercive and may impede or
derail local efforts to end the practice. The United Nations Chil-
dren’s Fund (UNICEF) has emphasized that there has been “little
research on the process and type of legislative reform needed in
different contexts with varying degrees of social acceptance of the
practice” (2010: 3). They add that the “role that legislation plays
in promoting behavior change in FGM/C is an area that is par-
ticularly complex, under-researched, and not fully understood”
(UNICEF 2010: 3).

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

This article explores the range of responses that have been
observed as legal measures were introduced in a rural region of
Senegal. This case study draws on data from a mixed-methods
study in Senegal to explore how anti-FGM legislation, when super-
imposed on communities in which the practice is already being
contested and targeted for elimination, interacts with an ongoing
process of change in both expected and unanticipated ways. More
broadly, we investigate broader theoretical debates on the nature of
social regulation and the inﬂuence of formal legal mechanisms on
the process of behavior change.

Since the early 1990s, Senegalese leaders have held prominent positions in interna-
tional human rights work, including the Chair of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights (Kéba Mbaye), President of the Geneva-based Commission of Jurists
(Adama Dieng), Head of the United Nations Center for Human Rights (Ibrahim Fall), and
head of Amnesty International (Pierre Sané) (Welch Jr. 1995).

Currently, 24 African nations where FGM/C is practiced have
prohibited it by law or constitutional decree (Table 1). These
include countries where FGM/C is widely practiced (e.g., Somalia,
Guinea, Egypt, and Djibouti), countries where the prevalence of
FGM/C is low (e.g., Uganda, Niger), as well as two countries that
did not use the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) module on
FGM/C because the practice is believed to occur in less than one
percent of the female population (South Africa, Zambia). The most
recent ban has been introduced in Somalia, where the 2012
Provisional Constitution prohibits “circumcision of girls.” With the
exception of the Central African Republic and Guinea, where bans
on FGM/C were instituted in the 1960s, the process of legal reform
began to take hold in African nations in the 1990s. This occurred
in the context in which international opposition to FGM/C was
being recast not only as a health issue, but as a human rights
issue (Boyle & Preves 2000; Shell-Duncan 2008). As international
consensus forged around framing FGM/C as a human rights viola-
tion, protection from FGM/C became understood as a right to
be enforced, granted, and implemented by the state. Thus, legal
strategies received new prominence, elevated over nonstate solu-
tions (Shell-Duncan 2008). At the International Conference on
Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994, strong state-
ments were issued calling for governments to enact legislation
speciﬁcally banning FGM/C, and to enforce such legislation (Boyle
& Preves 2000). The World Health Organization (WHO) as well
stated unequivocally that “protecting the rights of each and every
citizen is the responsibility of national governments,” and speciﬁ-
 
 
 
 
cally urged that “governments must enact and/or use anti-FGM
laws to protect girls” (WHO 1999: 14–15).

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

In this context, legislative reform measures have been adopted
by a growing number of nation states, but vary in terms of restric-
tion. In Mauritania and Tanzania (as in some Western countries,
including the Canada and the United States) FGM/C is illegal when
performed on minors. By contrast, laws banning FGM/C at all ages
have been passed in the majority of African countries. This reﬂects
the view that adult women are not in a position to provide consent
because of cultural pressures to undergo FGM/C, and the lack of
economic and legal autonomy. The laws vary substantially in deﬁn-

imposed. The criminal law enacted in Ghana imposes punishment
on anyone who performs FGM/C, whereas in countries such as
Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia, those who
participate in or commission the procedure are held criminally
liable. In several countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire,

Criminalizing FGC

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Togo), ﬁnes can be levied not only against
practitioners of FGM/C, but also anyone knowing about practice
and failing to report it. Mandatory reporting requirements can be
problematic from a legal perspective, particularly when health care
workers have been sought to treat post-FGM/C complications, as
they are also bound by duties to protect patient conﬁdentiality
(Katzive 2003). In 2011, Kenya extended the 2001 ban on FGM/C
among minors to apply to adult women, and also added an extra-
territoriality clause, extending restrictions to citizens and residents
who commit the crime outside the country’s border. Some legal
provision calls for increased penalties when FGM/C results in death
(Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Uganda), when
performed by a medical professional (Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire,
Eritrea, Kenya, Mauritania, Uganda), or in cases of recidivism
(Benin, Nigeria, Togo). FGM/C that results in death is punishable
by a life sentence in prison in Kenya and Uganda, and by the death
sentence in Ghana.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

In some instances, criminal laws have been intended to be
largely symbolic in nature, or to serve as a means of communicating
a new norm that is backed by state support, with the goal of
affecting behavior “expressively” by what it says, rather than what
it does (sanctions) (McAdams 2000). Educating the public about the
new legal provision may serve this purpose. In most cases, however,
the laws are intended to catalyze social change and to provide an
“enabling environment” for the abandonment of FGM/C (UNICEF
2010). In such cases, proposed legislation must be accompanied by
detailed plans for implementation, enforcement, and monitoring.
Across Africa, even in the presence of speciﬁc laws against
FGM/C, enforcement is variable. There have been scattered reports
of prosecution or arrests in cases involving FGM/C in several
African countries, including Burkina Faso, Egypt, Kenya, Ghana,
Senegal, and Sierra Leone (UNICEF 2010). Obiora (1997: 357)
highlights the fact that “diligent enforcement presupposes the
availability of material resources and cooperative enforcement
agents.” The 2004 Tanzania Human Rights report elaborates on
the complex and varied problems that surround enforcement of
the law: In some cases, police ofﬁcers were unaware of the law;
“victims” were often reluctant to testify against their own family
members; bribes, in some instances, were purportedly given to
leaders to assure freedom from prosecution; court cases often failed

who are already poor? Given that women are the prime initiators
and practitioners of FGM/C, would enforcement lead to the sys-
tematic imprisonment of women? Consequently, beyond the ques-
tion of whether criminal laws
be used as a tool for ending
FGM/C lies the question of whether they
be used to eliminate
the practice. Rahman and Toubia, however, suggest that the debate
over whether legislation should be used as a tool to combat FGM/C
is moot, arguing that “the fact that many Africans and Western
cultures have recently enacted laws prohibiting the practice creates
a
role for legislation, the effects of which should be closely
observed and documented in the coming years” (2000: xiv). The
varied effects of enacting speciﬁc anti-FGM legislation at the com-
munity level are, however, poorly understood. We examine this,
drawing on research on behavior change with respect to FGM/C in
Senegal, to test predictions from two leading theories on social
regulation.

Legal Theories on Social Regulation

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Legal theories of social control are often described as falling
 
 
 
 
predominantly into one of two schools of thought, law and econom-
ics and law and society, each of which examine the interplay
between informal local social control and the formal legal system
regulating human behavior, but differ with respect to the primacy
given to each.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

The law and economics movement rests on the assumption that
social control is achieved primarily by the state through the legal
system, and that governments are the chief source of rules and
enforcement mechanisms (Posner 2003). The law and economics
approach emphasizes the role of incentives and their ability to
inﬂuence behavior. It assumes that individuals are rational and
forward looking, and alter their behavior in the face of legal incen-
tives. Whether an individual commits a criminalized act is deter-
mined by an expected utility calculation. He or she would compare
the costs and beneﬁts of criminal activity, where the expected ben-
eﬁts include monetary and nonmonetary returns of the crime,
discounted by the probability of realization, and the expected costs

of the crime, which include formal and informal sanctions (e.g.,
social stigma), discounted by the probability of detection. This cal-
culus is based on the assumption that the probability and magni-
tude of sanctions are known. If the expected beneﬁts exceed the
expected costs, a rational individual may commit the offense. This
cost-beneﬁt analysis is weighted against those of other legitimate

options. Levying penalties against criminalized behavior elevates
the potential cost, thereby altering the cost-beneﬁt calculus and
discouraging the behavior.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

In his seminal article on economic approaches to criminal
law, Becker (1968) emphasized that enforcement is done by the
state, rather than victims, and hence the state bears the cost of
detecting, prosecuting, and punishing offenders. Limited resources
constrain expenditure on enforcement, and are assumed to be
allocated according to rational calculations about costs and beneﬁts
(McAdams & Ulen 2008). To maximize social welfare, micro-
economic models determine optimum levels of expenditure and
enforcement, and the magnitude and forms sanctions (ﬁne, impri-
sonment, or a combination) required to optimally deter crime.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Law and society scholars note that while there are examples of
successful deter rence-based strategies, there are also instances in
which threat of criminal penalty has a limited impact. They empha-
size that rules enforced at local levels often differ from formal law,
but adhere to widely shared understandings of appropriate behav-
iors and practices. When laws are antithetical to the norms of a
social group, the pecuniary costs may have limited power to deter
behaviors (Ellickson 1991; Tyler 1990). Posner (2000: 4) emphasizes
that, “the law is always imposed against a background stream of
nonlegal regulations—enforced by gossip, disapproval, ostracism
and violence.” The inﬂuence of social groups may be powerful
when there are strong social sanctions such as withholding or con-
ferring signs of status and respect, or withholding access to material
resources (Posner 2000). Thus, the law and society movement holds
 
 
 
 
that both law and social norms inﬂuence behavior, but often sub-
stantive norms supplement, and at times preempt, formal laws.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

The law and society perspective further holds that laws may
have limited power when they are poorly understood (Ellickson
1991; Tyler 1990). In his seminal study of closed range ordinances
regulating cattle ranching in California, Ellickson (1991) demon-
strated that people often settle disputes in total ignorance of their
legal rights, and that scant knowledge of the content of legal mea-
sures makes it improbable that fear of sanctions meaningfully regu-
lates behavior. He argues, similar to Tyler (1990), that beyond the
threat of legal sanctions, other important factors inﬂuence compli-
ance, including opinions of peers, informal sanctions from others
for deviating from expected behavior, personal morality, and per-

1991). These describe a variety of norms that have been described
by Mackie and LeJeune (2009)5 as falling into a typology shown in

Table 2. Mackie originally described FGM/C as a social convention,
locked in place predominantly by concerns over marriageability,
and possibly as a peer convention (Mackie 2000). A convention is a
social practice locked in place by interdependent expectations, and
change requires coordinating a shift in the reciprocal expectations
of interconnected social actors. More recently, Mackie and LeJeune
(2009) expanded the original application of the theory to also
address other meanings associated with FGM/C that operate as
various types of norms:
enforced by positive sanctions
for compliance or negative sanctions for noncompliance; religious
, enforced
commanded and enforced by God; and
norms
 
 
 
 
 
by internalized values of right or wrong. These norms stand in
contrast to
, enforced by government sanctions formally
stated in law. Social, moral, and religious norms may be intimately
intertwined in complex cultural systems, and if at odds with
legal norms, may generate resistance to complying with legal
regulations.

enforceability, dispute resolution, and behavior change (Table 3).
We investigate these predictions drawing on data from a case study
on behavior change with respect to FGM/C in Senegal. Speciﬁcally,
we ask: Is there widespread knowledge of the existence of a law
banning FGM in Senegal? Is the general public or are local leaders
aware of the speciﬁcs of law? For those with knowledge of the legal
provision, does this alter or inﬂuence their behaviors, or do local
norms regarding FGM/C override legal restrictions? To what extent

and Senegal. In order to examine responses to the law, we draw on
data from the Senegalese portion of this study, as FGM/C is not
illegal in The Gambia. At the national level, the prevalence of
FGM/C in Senegal is 28 percent (according to the 2005 DHS; Diop
2006),6 although rates vary dramatically by ethnicity and by subre-
gion. Our Senegalese study communities included mixed ethnicity
borderland communities in Fatick and Kaolack District, where the
estimated prevalences of FGM/C are 6 and 11 percent, respectively.
When discussing the signiﬁcance of FGM/C, those in favor of
the practice describe a number of inter related social, moral, and
religious norms that serve to uphold the practice. A number of
informants linked FGM/C and Islam, arguing that FGM/C provides
the cleanliness and puriﬁcation required for religious participation
and prayer. Many supporters of FGM/C also emphasize its moral
virtues such as promoting chastity prior to marriage, and having
controlled sexuality and ﬁdelity once married. Greater emphasis,
however, is placed on the importance of FGM/C as a crucial com-
ponent of training and proper childrearing (Shell-Duncan et al.
2011). As girls are typically cut at a very early age, they undergo a
transformation that is not only physical, but also prepares them to
be recipients of this training. They are taught to “know the eye”—

and uphold the traditions of their ancestors. As we describe
elsewhere, FGM/C is widely seen as “women’s business,” in that

it is organized and practiced by older women on young girls
(Shell-Duncan et al. 2011). It signals to other women who have
undergone FGM/C that a girl has been trained to respect the
authority of her elders who have undergone FGM/C, thereby cre-
ating an intergenerational hierarchy of power among women
who have undergone FGM/C. In return for signaling their subor-
dination, young women gain “insider” status, and hence access
 to the social connections and social support of elder women. We
have described this as an intergenerational peer convention
(Shell-Duncan et al. 2011). Those who are not cut are sanctioned by
being denied access to the same level of social support. Uncut
women may be insulted by being labeled

“uncircumcised,” but also rude, ignorant, immature, uncivilized,

are told they “know nothing,” and are often
ostracized among women with FGM/C and excluded from attend-
ing ceremonial events such as weddings or FGM/C rituals.

Despite the strong cultural signiﬁcance ascribed to the tradition
of FGM/C by its proponents, increasingly intense debates center on
whether it is an outmoded custom that should be discarded. For
decades, Senegalese activists have been at the forefront of both local
and global campaigns aimed at eliminating FGM/C. In February
1984, Senegal hosted a UN-sponsored conference that aimed to
discuss anti-FGM policies. With delegates from 20 African nations
in attendance, a pivotal outcome of this seminar was the formation
of the Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting
the Health of Women and Children (IAC). One of the primary
mandates of the IAC was to call for governments to use of existing
national legislation to criminalize FGM/C, and to implement legis-
lation speciﬁcally banning the practice.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

In 1999, Senegal adopted a criminal law that prohibits the
violation of “the integrity of the genital organs of a female person.”
The law is applicable to anyone “who violates or attempts to violate”
the prohibition; anyone who “provokes these sexual mutilations
or gives instructions for their commission.” The penalty includes
imprisonment for six months to ﬁve years, or where cutting results
in death, hard labor for life.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Following passage of the law, media reports claimed that the law
was intended to be symbolic in nature. Senegalese parliamentarian
Momar Lo, who introduced the bill in the parliament, was quoted
claiming that “no one is really going to go to jail . . . The govern-

There were no provisions in place, however, to ensure the purely
symbolic nature of the law. In the ﬁrst year following the passage of
the law, there were two arrests, but following an emotional public
outcry, the charges were dropped and no convictions resulted. In
an effort to promote public acceptance of the law, the government

supported a two-year program concentrated on awareness raising
and educational outreach that disseminated information about the
existence and content of the new law. Since that time there have
been a number of high-proﬁle arrests and convictions that have
received a tremendous amount of media coverage, and have gen-
erated debate as to whether the law should be altered, ranging
from calls to repeal the law to appeals to stiffen the penalties
(UNFPA n.d.).

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Senegal has been the site of a number of media campaigns and
nongovernmental organization-sponsored initiatives aimed at
ending the practice of FGM/C. It is the home of the massive Tostan
program, whose goal is to enhance participants’ active involvement
in the social, economic, political, and cultural development of
their communities (Tostan 1999). Beginning in 1997, the basic
education program led to the organization of public declarations of
community-wide abandonment of FGM/C. Tostan has now orga-
nized such declarations in over 5,000 communities in Senegal (as of
March 2013, Tostan, pers. comm.).

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Recent developments in Senegal make this site a unique setting
for examining the effects and interaction of local nonlegal and legal
factors inﬂuencing the norms surrounding practice of FGM/C. We
seek to gain practical insights on the utility of law as a tool to
eliminate the practice of FGM/C, and theoretical insights regard-
ing the relationship between culturally mediated norms and
formal law.

Data were collected over a 3-year period in Senegalese border
villages in Fatick and Kaolack Districts beginning in 2004. This
study site was selected after consulting with Tostan to determine a
locale where the Tostan program had been implemented and
where our research activities would not
interfere with their
ongoing work. Study sites did not provide a nationally representa-
tive sample, but were instead selected to capture variation in aban-
donment of FGC and the social dynamics surrounding the practice.
Communities were ethnically diverse, included a mixture of fami-
lies that did and did not practice FGC in the past, and varied as to

Our research was expressly not

intended to evaluate the Tostan intervention
program, and should not be interpreted as such. We did beneﬁt from the assistance of
Molly Melching, the director of Tostan, and other Tostan employees in identifying which
villages in our study area had participated in various aspects of the Tostan program.

munities was of interest for several reasons. Movement across
the border is very ﬂuid, and communities on either side share
very similar characteristics in terms of dominant religion (over 90
percent Muslim), subsistence activities, cultural practices, and
climate. It is not uncommon for extended families to live divided
on different sides of the political border, and some villages are
literally bisected by the border. Therefore, this setting allowed us to
examine the effects of differing national characteristics such as
overall prevalence of FGM/C, as well as different intervention pro-
grams and national policies addressing FGM/C.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

The study was conducted in two phases. The ﬁrst phase
involved qualitative research. In-depth interviews were conducted
with men, women, community and religious leaders, health profes-
sionals, and former circumcisers. Interview were conducted by two
local ﬁeld-workers, one male and one female, who were trained in
qualitative methods, the use of interview guidelines, and the overall
goals of the research. In Senegal, a total of 98 interviews were taped,
and later transcribed and translated into English. Six focus group
discussions were also conducted, divided by gender, age (elder vs.
younger men or women), and whether participants came from a
village that had or had not participated in the Tostan program. At
the University of Washington, the transcripts were then typed and
coded using a qualitative data analysis program, Atlas ti (GmbH,
Berlin, Germany). An initial set of codes was created by the senior
investigators, and expanded while coding initial
interviews. A
subsample of 40 interviews was double coded and compared, reveal-
ing high consistency between investigators. The investigators met
weekly to discuss emerging themes and constructs using a grounded
theory approach (Miles & Huberman 1994; Strauss & Corbin 1998).
Focus group data were also coded, and themes and the degree of
consensus or division were noted, and analyzed in a factorial design
by constructing an overview grid organizing the focus group ﬁnd-
ings along break characteristics (gender, age, Tostan vs. non-Tostan)
(following the methods of Knodel 1993).

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

The themes and constructs identiﬁed in qualitative data analy-
sis were then used to create an ethnographically grounded survey.
This included creating a survey instrument to measure an impor-
tant concept identiﬁed in our qualitative analysis, namely an
individual’s readiness to change. Categories of readiness to change
combined two elements: an individual’s preference regarding

FGM/C and his actual or anticipated behavior (Shell-Duncan &
Hernlund 2006). During our pretest of the survey, we classiﬁed an
individual’s readiness to change using two methods: (1) a staging
algorithm based on responses to six questions on preference and
behavior, and (2) an individual’s self-assigned readiness to change
after having the categories explained (Shell-Duncan et al. 2010).

The Senegalese version also included three questions on the law
banning FGC. A developmental pretest of the survey was car ried
out in March and April 2006. This involved a conceptual review of
the entire questionnaire with key consultants, evaluation of alter-
nate forms of questions, testing the effect of question order, and
assessing reliability using a test–retest process. The entire question-
naire was translated into Mandinka and Wolof, back translated
into English, and discrepancies were reconciled. The concordance
between self-described and assigned readiness to change was exam-
ined. However, since neither represents a “gold standard,” we
contrasted the strengths and weaknesses of each categorization
method. Because the self-described readiness to change stages reso-
nated so clearly with pretest participants, we elected to use this
measure in quantitative data analysis of the full survey. Further
details of the pretest are found in Shell-Duncan et al. (2010).

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

The second phase of the study involved administering the ques-
tionnaire, data entry, and quantitative data analysis. A multistage
sampling procedure was used in which villages where FGM/C was
practiced by at least some residents were identiﬁed, and then strati-
ﬁed into Tostan and non-Tostan villages, and whether they were
large or small. Cluster sampling of villages was done in each
stratum, and compounds were randomly selected in each village.
The number of compounds sampled was proportional to the total
number of compounds. Residents were asked to list all female
residents between ages 18 and 40 who had given birth to at least
one girl. Using a random number table, one eligible woman was
recruited from each compound. Women were asked if they had a
husband, and if he was alive. If they responded positively, a random
number table was used to select one out of every ﬁve husbands to be
invited to be interviewed. The overall response rate was 96.4
percent. In Senegal, survey data were obtained from 265 women
and 82 husbands. Quantitative data from the survey questionnaire
were analyzed using Stata software (Statacorp, College Station,
TX, USA).

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

We evaluated associations between readiness to change and
perceived power of the law among Senegalese respondents from
families for which FGM/C was a tradition using logistic regression
(LR). As the outcome of interest for LR models, self-described
readiness to change was characterized in two binary variables:
willing abandoners versus willing adherents, and contemplators

As the predictor of interest, a law score was created by combin-
ing responses to three questions on enforceability and power of

with a higher value indicating stronger expressed belief in the
power and enforceability of the law banning FGM/C in Senegal.

 
 
 
 
 

Confounding in LR models was deﬁned as a change in the
effect of the predictor of interest greater than 10 percent with the
inclusion of a control variable. Age, sex, and ethnicity were evalu-
ated for confounding. Only age met this criterion in one model,
and thus was controlled in both LR models.

We present results of this LR as both odds ratios (ORs) and
predicted probabilities; ORs tend to overstate associations for
outcomes that are not rare (e.g., 5 percent prevalence; Davies,
Crombie, & Tavakoli 1998), while predicted probabilities avoid
this distortion. Predicted probabilities were calculated by calculat-
ing values for logit X (where X is the binary readiness to change
outcome) across the range of law scores, holding age constant at
the observed mean; the probability
(X) was then calculated as
exp(logit X)/[1 + exp(logit X)] and graphed to represent the asso-
ciation between readiness to change and law scores.

groups. Overall, 49 percent of
the women reported having
undergone FGM/C. Interethnic marriage has become increasingly
common, as the tradition of arranged marriage is giving way to
“love marriage.” This has led to an increasing number of FGM/C-
incongruent marriages, where one spouse is from a family that
traditionally practiced FGC and the other did not. We draw on
analyses of the qualitative and survey data to evaluate predictions of
the law and economics and law and society paradigms.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Knowledge of the Law

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

The law and economics paradigm rests on the assumption that
people are aware of the law, and that this knowledge factors into
their calculation of risks and beneﬁts of a particular course of
action. The law must therefore be effectively communicated and
relevant to local actors (Posner 2003). Alternatively, the law and
society perspective holds that people are often unaware or only
vaguely familiar with the content of legal provisions (Ellickson
1991). Instead, the role of local norms is paramount, evidenced in
the force of weight given to nonlegal sanctions such as ostracism. In
assessing responses to the law banning FGM in Senegal in our study
communities, one crucial question then is what was the awareness
level regarding the anti-FGM law?

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

In-depth interviews revealed that knowledge of the existence of
a law banning FGM/C was widespread. Many informants reported
hearing radio broadcasts informing the general public about the
anti-FGM law, and others learned of the ban in
(outdoor
 
 
 
 
 
public meetings) organized by the elders, or through word of
mouth. Most people, however, knew very few details about the
content of the legal provision, including potential targets of pros-
ecution, the penalty for violation, or whether the statute contains
an extraterritoriality clause banning FGM/C outside of Senegal’s
national borders. Contrary to expectations, a vague understanding
of the details of the ban did not reduce concerns about prosecution.
Instead, it allowed people to imagine its application in a wide range
of circumstances, including those beyond the true provision.

objective 

rence theory rests on a psychological process whereby individuals are
dissuaded from committing a crime if they perceive legal sanctions
as certain, swift, and/or severe (Williams & Hawkins 1986). Highly
publicizing a few cases of prosecution should dissuade at least some
community members from practicing FGC (Obiora 1997). Williams
and Hawkins (1986), however, draw a distinction between perceived
legal sanctions and
legal sanctions (the actual likelihood of
arrest), and argue that objective measures of legal sanctions do not
in all instances equate with perceived legal sanctions. This appears
 to be true in our study communities. Informants, when asked, were
unaware of any cases of enforcement of Senegal’s anti-FGM law
in their own communities, or elsewhere in Senegal. Many people,
nonetheless, viewed the law as potentially enforceable. Simply
rumors or imaginings of enforceability generated fear of prosecu-
tion. Indeed, lack of clarity on the details of the legal restriction
contributed to the impression that the law could be broadly applied.
This ﬁnding was supported by the survey questionnaire data as well:
84 percent of respondents agreed with the statement, “The law
banning female circumcision is more powerful than we are, so we
must change the practice,” and 80 percent agreed with the state-
ment, “Someone who openly breaks the law banning female circum-
cision needs to worry about being punished” (Table 5).

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Dispute Resolution

 
 
 
 

The law and economics paradigm posits that when disputes
arise, formal legal rules and processes are invoked to seek resolu-
tion and impose punishment. By contrast, the law and society
paradigm emphasizes that local rules trump the rule of law, and

predicts that people will turn to local dispute resolution bodies
rather than the formal legal system. Toomey (2010) argues that
customary dispute resolution is often the primary means of access-
ing justice, particularly in developing countries, because it is usually
procedurally acceptable to local community members, and geo-
graphically and ﬁnancially accessible. In Senegal, the local dispute

resolution body is made up of the village leader (
) and council
of elders. In villages that participated in the Tostan program, there
 is also often an enforcement committee, formed to assure that
families comply with the declaration to abandon FGM/C. During
the course of our ﬁeldwork, one recent conﬂict was fresh in the
minds of residents of one village, and illustrates the interplay
between the state legal system and local enforcement and dispute
resolution bodies. Binta,8 a 35-year-old Mandinka woman, had
been residing in this village for 19 years since marrying her
husband and moving away from her family’s compound in a
Gambian village just across the border. She stayed in close touch
with her family, and visited for occasions such as weddings and
naming ceremonies. Binta, we were told, had gone to visit her
family some four months earlier, traveling with her seven-year-old
daughter Awa. Upon returning from the trip, Awa apparently
disclosed a “secret” to her friends: That during the visit, she had
undergone FGM/C along with her female cousins. Once word got
out, the matter was taken up by the enforcement committee. One
former member of an enforcement committee explained:

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

A: Tostan taught us how to identify people who do it in secret. That
is why nobody does it in secret. If they do, it would be reported to
me. . .. Once, the committee identiﬁed someone who circumcised
their daughter across the border. And we went to the Alkalo (village
leader), and we agreed, and in front of the whole village we said, “We
will ﬁne you, and you pay, or we will report you to the authority.”
This family paid the ﬁne. They were used as an example, and now
 
 
 
 
 
people are afraid to take girls across the border.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Q: It is my understanding that it is not illegal to take girls to circum-
cision in The Gambia. Would the authorities still get involved?

 
 
 
 

A: Yes, they could. We have agreed [to stop circumcision].

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Several things from this exchange are noteworthy. In actuality,
Senegal’s anti-FGM law does not contain an extraterritoriality
clause, and therefore having a girl cut in The Gambia is not illegal.
However, since many residents of this village participated in the
Tostan program and collectively agreed to stop practicing FGM/C,
Binta violated the new agreement, thus violating a new and con-
tested social norm. The enforcement committee used the law to
bolster their authority and the weight of their decisions even

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

though the law does not apply in this case. This illustrates that

though the law does not apply in this case. This illustrates that
when there are contestations in local norms, formal
law can
strengthen the stance of those whose norms are most closely
aligned with the legal rule (see also Merry 2006).

The Role of the Law in Promoting Behavior Change

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

According to the law and economics rationale, people ought to
look to the law to determine the appropriate course of action. The
law must be accepted as legitimate, and fear of punishment should,
at least for some, motivate abandonment of FGC. Many law and
society scholars, by contrast, contend that formal law has been
overrated as an instrument of change, and point to a growing body
of evidence that reveals that segments of social life are located and
shaped beyond the reach of the law. Hence, moral, religious, and
social norms and concerns over rewards and sanctions from the
social group exert considerable inﬂuence on individual actions,
above and often beyond externally imposed criminal punishment.
While examining responses to the law, it is important to note
that in our study communities, there were active, and at time
heated, debates as to whether FGM/C has become an obsolete
custom that should be discarded, or whether it is a deeply valued
tradition handed down from ancestors that must be retained. Our
data show that there exist a wide range of opinions on FGM/C not
just across communities, but even within families. In previous work
(Shell-Duncan & Hernlund 2006), we have described the process
of behavior change with respect to FGM/C in terms of stages of
readiness to change that combine information on individuals’
(1) actual behavior (abandon or not abandon FGM/C), and (2) pre-
ference (supports or opposes FGM/C) (Figure 1). Willing adherents
are those who favor continuation of FGM/C and are continuing the

who thought we were referring to medical practitioners rather than practitioners of

We examine readiness to change in Senegalese women who
come from a circumcising tradition, as well as in the subsample of
husbands (Table 6). With greatest frequency, women in this group
describe themselves as willing adherents, while husbands are most
commonly self-described reluctant abandoners. Pairing husbands
and wives, complete information is available for 48 couples. Stage of
change concordance within couples was 52.63 percent. This dem-
onstrates substantial potential discord within couples: Almost half
of husbands were in a different stage of readiness to change than
their wives, with husbands being less likely to be willing adherents
of FGM/C than their wives, and more likely to self-identify with
“none” of the categories of readiness for change.

plators are compared to willing adherents. Predicted probabilities
calculated from this LR are represented graphically in Figure 2,
and show that increasing law score (stronger agreement with asser-
tions that the law banning FGM/C is powerful and readily enforced)
was signiﬁcantly positively associated with the willing abandoner or
contemplator (vs. willing adherent) stage of readiness to change. In
comparison to those who support the continuation of FGM/C, those
who have abandoned the practice or are actively questioning the
practice have signiﬁcantly greater fear of prosecution. This is con-
sistent with the prediction of the law and economics theory that
the potential pecuniary costs help dissuade the practice. However,
among ardent supporters of FGM/C, fear of prosecution and belief
in the power of the law is signiﬁcantly lower. This is also consistent
with the prediction of the law and society theory that when legal
norms run counter to social norms, threat of legal sanctions holds
little sway. Consequently, readiness to change is strongly associated
with the inﬂuence of threats of punishment and beliefs in power of
the law. This suggests that imposing legal regulations in communi-
ties where there is unanimous support for the practice of FGM/C

divergent opinions about the continuation of FGM/C, legislation
can give added strength to those in favor of abandonment.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Knowing that there are strongly divergent views on whether
the practice of FGM/C should be abandoned, as well as varied views
on the enforceability and power of the law, it is understandable that

our qualitative data reveal a wide range of responses to the law. A

media broadcasts informing the general public about the anti-FGM
law, although emotional reactions to this change varied tremen-
dously. Some reported being sad about being forced to leave a
valued cultural practice, and viewed themselves as powerless
against the force of the law:

For others, knowledge of the legal ban did not on its own motivate
abandonment of FGM/C. Instead, FGM/C continued, but generated

deep anxiety about the prospect of criminal sanctions. When the
Tostan intervention was later introduced in the village, however,
their anti-FGM program was welcomed as a means of ending the
ongoing fear of punishment. As one Sereer woman commented:
“The campaign was after the law. But after the law people were
doing it. The campaign made the law stronger and many people
have agreed that they have stopped.” This lends support to the
assertion that the law may facilitate the change process by giving
additional leverage to those who have become persuaded about the
need to abandon FGM/C.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

At the same time, we found that those who abandon the practice
were forced to grapple with the social repercussions of not having
circumcised their daughters, and often experienced misgivings
about their decision. One Mandinka mother, for instance, reported
sleeplessness from worrying about the fate of her two daughters
who have fallen into what she described as the “law trap.” She
explained: “the law was passed seven years ago and my daughters
were seven and ﬁve years old at the time. Now the eldest is fourteen
years old. If I look at them I get scared.”

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Williams and Hawkins (1986) distinguish between the direct
and indirect consequences of legal sanctions that promote deter-
rence, a distinction that is important in the case of FGM/C as well.
The Senegalese law, for instance, is aimed at deterring not only
parents of young girls, but also circumcisers. Interviews with some
former circumcisers revealed that they had stopped practicing
following the passage of the law. Additionally, while the skills of
circumcisers were previously passed down from one generation to
the next, most claimed that they did not train an apprentice before
“putting down the knife.” Some informants in our study commu-
nities noted that, in the absence of trusted and experienced local
circumcisers, the demand has been met by “traveling circumcisers,”
who reportedly circulate throughout communities in The Gambia,
Guinea Bissau, and elsewhere. Many informants were suspicious of
the training and qualiﬁcations of these circumcisers, and suspected
that they are motivated by economic gain:

One indirect effect, then, of deterrence of circumcisers is that
those favoring continuation of the practice must weigh the risks
of employing a traveling circumciser with questionable skills. A

number of people reported this as a reason to favor legal bans on
FGM/C.

 
 
 
 
 

While direct or indirect effects of threats of legal sanctions
resulted in abandonment in some cases, this was not universally
true. Some people ascribe strong cultural value to the practice,
and, as predicted by the law and society paradigm, rewards
and sanctions from their peers and elders exerted considerable
inﬂuence, above and often beyond externally imposed rewards
or punishments. Some described legislative reform efforts as an
attempt to “break culture” and force assimilation with dominant
ethnic groups that do not practice FGM/C (what some called
“Woloﬁzation”). One Mandinka woman remarked, “If they (the
people who passed the law) did not leave their tradition, we will
not leave ours. They want us to be like them.” In some of our
study communities, reactance simmered below the surface, and it
took little to incite fervent vocal opposition to the law. In one
conservative community, following a tense focus group discussion,
participants stood and chanted phrases such as, “We will not let
our culture be destroyed!”

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Other supporters of FGM/C responded to threats of legal sanc-
tions by taking the practice underground. As Gunning predicted,
“if people support the practice, then the law will not actually
prevent the surgeries from being performed: people will just hide
the fact that they are doing it” (1991-92: 229). For ethical reasons
we did not in our study directly ask people if, following the ban,
they had continued to practice FGM/C. Nonetheless informants
often offered general comments:

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Q: What changes have you seen in the practice over the years?

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

A: People are not practicing it as how it was in the past. Even if they
are doing it, then it is done secretly but not openly done. And that is
a change I have noticed in our community here. (Sereer woman)

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Secrecy, some informants explained, was achieved partially by
eliminating the public celebration that had formerly accompanied
the practice. Additionally, it was considered more difﬁcult to detect
that FGM/C performed on infants than on older girls, as infants
are not visibly absent from village activities during recovery. Con-
sequently, as predicted by the law and society paradigm, among
ardent supporters of FGM/C, legal norms ran counter to the social

norms upholding the practice, and had little inﬂuence in deterring
the practice. This reveals that when legislative reform is not accom-
panied by other effective means of addressing the broader cultural
context, threat of criminal sanctions does not appear to be an
effective means of catalyzing behavior change. However, when the
practice of FGM/C was contested, and where the process of change

was underway, legal sanctions strengthened the stance of those in
favor of abandonment of FGM/C.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Discussion

We have analyzed our data on responses to the law banning FGM
in Senegal with respect to two leading theories on social regulation:
the law and economics and law and society paradigms. Each theory
leads to divergent predictions on individuals’ knowledge of the law,
views on enforceability, use of the formal legal system in dispute
resolution, and ability of the law to change behavior. Our research
reveals support for certain elements of each theory, shedding light
on how legal norms are variably weighed against social, moral, and
religious norms that serve to uphold the practice of FGM/C. We ﬁnd
that threat of criminal sanctions is weighed against the ef fects of
defying local norms, and this calculus is strongly inﬂuenced by the
degree to which the cultural value has been called into question.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Key ﬁndings of our research include the fact that mass enforce-
ment of the law is not required to generate widespread fear of
prosecution. However, fear of prosecution, while contributing to
motivation to abandon FGM/C for some individuals, results in
multiple responses. While some people viewed the ban as a reason
to reluctantly abandon FGM/C, others deﬁed the ban and continued
the practice underground. Reactance in our study communities did
not spark visible public protests, although in some communities
deep resentment over the “criminalization of culture” simmered
just below the surface and boiled over when the topic was raised. It
 is important to note as well that there exist some individuals not only
in elite urban echelons of Senegalese society, but in a relatively poor,
rural context as well, who expressed having serious reservations
about the prospects of having FGM/C performed on their daughters
and who welcomed the passage of the law and intervention efforts.
Surprisingly, these multiple responses coexisted not just within a
single region or village, but even within an extended family. Impor-
tantly, where the practice of FGM/C was being contested, legislation
served to give added strength to those contemplating or favoring
abandonment. This lends support to the assertion of Rahman and
Toubia (2000: 13) that “law can be a useful tool for change, giving
NGOs and individuals greater leverage in persuading communities

 to abandon the practice.”

 
 
 
 

Many scholars have argued that law alone seldom changes
behavior, and that legal reform must be accompanied by other
change efforts that address the culturally mediated social, moral,
and religious norms that may uphold the practice (e.g., Obiora
1997; Rahman & Toubia 2000). In our study communities, some

respondents who continued to secretly practice FGM/C expressed
deep anxiety over not complying with the law, and feared being
caught by the authorities. This fear did not, in and of itself, lead to
abandonment of FGM/C in most instances, but instead led to resi-
dents to welcome the Tostan program to their community. The
Tostan intervention was positively viewed as a means of organizing
change that would lead to compliance with the anti-FGM law, and
other Tostan programs, such as literacy, preventive health care, and
sanitation, were welcomed as well. Our ﬁndings support the view
expressed by UNICEF (2005: 29), who describe the role of legisla-
tion in terms of “creating an enabling environment”; they empha-
size that, beyond serving as a deterrent, legal bans provide a support
mechanism for those who have or wish to abandon FGM/C. Conse-
quently, as Lewis and Gunning (1998) anticipated, a legislative
approach can work in a complementary fashion with an integrated
community-based intervention approach when addressing FGM/C.
At the same time, it is important to emphasize that in our study
communities, those who practiced FGM/C were keenly aware that
they are in the minority in Senegal, and that the practice has been
targeted for elimination. There were widely divergent views on
whether the practice of FGM/C should be discarded or retained,
and readiness to change was found to be strongly associated with the
perceived inﬂuence of threats of punishment and beliefs in the
power of the law. Where the practice of FGM/C was being contested,
legislation was able to give added strength to the opinion of those
who favor abandonment. Even in the context of customary dispute
resolution, the weight of force of the new legal norm was able to be
co-opted and used to strengthen the stance of those whose norms
most closely aligned with the new legal rule. Our ﬁndings are,
however, speciﬁc to the border region of Senegal, a setting in which
the minority of residents in the region practice FGM/C, the nation’s
dominant ethnic group does not practice FGM/C, and decades of
campaigns against the practice have sparked active debates. The
successful elements of legislative reform seen here may not be found
in other regions of Senegal, or in other countries, in which a
majority of the population practices FGM/C. Further research is
needed to more fully understand responses to legislative reform
across the range of social contexts in which it is being implemented,
and should investigate how it can best complement other reform
strategies aimed at eliminating FGC.
