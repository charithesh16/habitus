1. Introduction

Children’s education is one of the pillars of personal achieve-
ment and global economic development. Yet, a signiﬁcant portion
of children in developing countries remain out of school. In 2013,
about 30 million primary-school-age children in Sub-Saharan
Africa were not enrolled in school. This accounts for half of the
world’s unenrolled children (UNESCO, UIS, 2015). As highlighted
by the UNESCO report, ‘‘half of these children in the region have
never been enrolled and may never enroll without additional
incentives” (UNESCO, 2015). This statement raises the issue of a
good understanding of which factors can foster or dampen school
participation in order to apply effective educational policies. This
paper contributes to this literature by analyzing how social inter-
actions can shift the decision to enroll children in school in a rural
area in central Senegal. In Senegal particularly, half a million
primary-school-age children (between 6 and 11 years old) were

Alongside classical determinants of education, there is a growing literature of social interactions in edu-
cation which seems to be particularly concentrated in developed countries. This seems paradoxical as
norms, culture and social capital appear to play a more important role in everyday life in Africa. We
use a rich data set collected in Niakhar in rural Senegal, between 2001 and 2008 to study whether the
school attendance of a child depends on the school attendance of other children in the same social group.
Social groups are deﬁned using geographical proximity and caste groups. While it is particularly difﬁcult
to empirically identify the impact of social group behavior, we take advantage of the temporal structure
of the data to deal with a number of endogeneity issues. We rely moreover on different empirical strate-
gies and placebo tests to argue that our results are not subject to confounding interpretations. Results
show evidence of a strong and positive effect of social interactions on school attendance and the impact
is greater for members of the highest caste.

out of school in 2013 (UNESCO, UIS, 2015), which accounts for a
large share (1/4) of the two million primary-school-age children.
Beyond the necessary efforts of investing in schools, teachers, text-
books etc. it is crucial to target the most vulnerable children and to
identify factors that contribute to this lack of schooling. Social
norms and beliefs are probably part of these factors. In this paper,
we construct social categories based on caste groups and geo-
graphical proximity and show that children’s school attendance
is affected by the general school attendance of the child’s social
group.

Some papers have demonstrated the importance of social inter-
actions on school performance or school attendance. Bobonis and
Finan (2009) and Lalive and Cattaneo (2009) using the Progresa
program, a randomized conditional cash transfer program in Mex-
ico, show that school attendance increased for non-treated chil-
dren in villages covered by the program suggesting a ripple
effect. Likewise, in the assessment of a girls’ scholarship program
in Kenya, Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton (2009) point out that
school performance of other girls less likely to get a scholarship
and even of boys, improved. A growing body of literature in eco-
nomics studies peer effects in education but seems to be particu-
larly focused on developed countries (Hoxby, 2000; Sacerdote,
2001;

A big challenge in this paper is to properly identify the impact of
social group behavior on the school attendance decision. Generally,
identiﬁcation in social interaction models is particularly difﬁcult
due to multiple endogeneity biases that make the isolation of the
true social interaction effect difﬁcult. Manski (1993) shows in the
linear-in-means model that the estimated effect can simply denote
the fact that individuals with the same unobserved characteristics
or exposed to the same environmental factors tend to behave sim-
ilarly, which makes difﬁcult the separation of the endogenous
social interactions effect from the contextual effects. The formation
of groups can also be endogenous leading to a self-selection bias.
Individuals with similar preferences toward education may, for
example, belong to the same group or sort themselves over time
leading to a dynamic sorting phenomenon. Mofﬁtt (2001) details
the different endogeneity problems and offers some solutions to
them. Blume, Brock, Durlauf, and Ioannides (2011) have amply dis-
cussed the identiﬁcation of social interactions.

The panel structure of the data allows us to estimate a dynamic
model, with the lagged attendance rate as the main explanatory
variable, which helps to solve the reﬂection problem. We also
use estimations with individual ﬁxed effects enabling us to predict
not levels but changes over time of the school attendance decision
by the lagged attendance rate of the social group. Self-selection
into social groups in our case is likely to occur only at the village
level since caste membership is time-invariant. We use data on
internal migration between villages to account for dynamic sort-
ing. Furthermore, we estimate the effect of the difference between
the attendance rate of the caste and the attendance rate of the vil-
lage and rely on some placebo tests as well to argue that geograph-
ical confounding factors do not drive our results. We ﬁnd that the
social group behavior strongly inﬂuences children attendance deci-
sion with a point estimate ranging between 0.25 and 0.30 percent-
age points.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the study area, the caste system in West Africa, the data,
and some descriptive evidence. Section 3 explains the methodol-
ogy and the identiﬁcation strategies. Section 4 discusses the
results. Section 5 concludes.

2. Descriptive analysis

2.1. Presentation of the study area

The study area Niakhar is a rural zone in the region of Fatick
located 135 km east of Dakar, the capital of Senegal (see Fig. 1).
It contains 30 villages divided into two rural communes (third ter-

Ammermueller & Pischke, 2009). Many of these studies show that
peer effects inﬂuence educational performance.

Akerlof and Kranton (2002) connect this economic literature
with the sociological literature and explain how in addition to eco-
nomic determinants, social
interactions can highly inﬂuence
schooling. They built a model which formalizes ideas of conformity
and social norms applied in education. This model adds a social
dimension to the standard utility function of education demand.
The social utility is expressed as a cost that the individual bears
when he is not in line with the expected behavior of his social
group. The social utility function takes into account this disutility
that arises due to deviation from the social norm. Therefore, a child
who belongs to a social group where schooling is not highly valued
is less likely to be enrolled and vice versa. This aspect is rarely con-
sidered in economic studies. In Africa in particular, the current
school system is derived from colonization and is not incorporated
in traditional practices particularly in rural zones. This may explain
a kind of reticence in some contexts to enroll children in school.
Thus, the schooling decision can be strongly driven by social
aspects.

To capture how social features impact educational decisions, we
rely on caste3 groups and geographical proximity. We exploit a rich
data set from a population monitoring established since 1983, a
school monitoring carried out between 2001 and 2008 and a house-
hold survey conducted in 2003 in 30 villages in an area in Central
Senegal called Niakhar. Castes may convey different norms and tra-
ditions that can affect schooling. Some studies demonstrate a rela-
tionship between castes and schooling. Dostie and Jayaraman
(2006) in India show differentiating effects between castes and ﬁnd
a signiﬁcant impact of caste fractionalization on children’s schooling.
Jacoby and Mansuri (2015) show in rural Pakistan that low caste
children are deterred from going to school if the most convenient
school is in a hamlet dominated by high-caste households. In our
study area, castes can be divided into three main groups: farmers,
the royal caste and griots and artisans. Thus, children in the same vil-
lage and of the same caste constitute a social category. The royal
caste is considered as the top of the social hierarchy, followed by
the farmer caste and lastly by the caste of griots and artisans. Mem-
bership to a caste depends only on lineage and not on current
profession.

Our paper contributes to the existing literature on the determi-
nants of education in several ways. First, many studies on peer
effects in education are conducted in a school or a classroom con-
text and aim to explain school performance, not attendance. Our
study aims to examine whether social interactions represent a
key determinant of school attendance in Senegal and the scale in
which social interactions are studied (the caste and the village) is
much broader than the classroom or the school level. Second, there
is little evidence on social interactions in education in Africa.
Several studies focus on developed countries, which seems some-
how a missing opportunity as social norms have an important role
in everyday life in Africa. Our study could then be useful to better
understand attitudes toward schooling and to improve educational
and social policies. Finally, we give particular attention to the role
of castes in Senegal. Historically, castes represented a fundamental
component of Senegalese society and still today remain omnipre-
sent in different aspects of the functioning of the society particu-
larly in rural areas. Unfortunately, the vast majority of studies on
caste groups by economists and some other social scientists have
focused on Southern Asia. Little is known about how the
categorization of the society through caste membership inﬂuences
economic life and shifts some economic decisions in Senegal.

3 A caste is a hierarchical social, endogamous and hereditary group.

ritorial division in Senegal) Diarrère and Ngayokhème. The popula-
tion in the study area has increased from 31092 inhabitants in
2001 to 43797 inhabitants in 2008. The study area covers a land
area of 203 km2 resulting in a relatively high density of 216 inhab-
itants per km2. The zone is populated at 96% by the Sereer ethnic
group, the second most represented ethnic group in Senegal (14%
nationwide) behind the Wolof (41%). Farming is the main eco-
nomic activity in the area dominated by groundnut and millet cul-
tivation. According to administrative educational data, the study
area had 23 public primary schools in 2014.

A thorough description of this area and of the demographic

surveillance data was presented in Delaunay et al. (2013).

2.2. Caste system in West Africa

The caste system is widely present in many countries of West
Africa particularly in Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. Tamari (1991)
gives a good description of castes in West Africa. The caste system
is derived from a historical social division. The caste structure may
be slightly different from one country to another or from one eth-
nic group to another. But a common feature of caste we can found
in almost all of the caste systems in West Africa is the dual distri-
bution into two main categories: nobles and non-nobles. They rep-
resent the largest part of the society and are associated with
agricultural or related activities such as herding or ﬁshing. A small
portion of the nobles held the political power and ruled the king-
doms. They are the descendants of royal families and constitute
the upper-level of the social hierarchy. The second category in
the caste system considered as non-nobles is mainly composed
of the griots and artisans. Griots were in charge of the oral tradition
and were the guardians of the history of the kingdom. They knew
the genealogy of the royal families and the nobles. They mastered
the art of speaking, worked as spokespersons for the royal court
and sang the praises of the kings and nobles. Artisans were at
the same social level as griots and practiced craft activities. They
were usually metalsmiths, shoemakers, jewelers, potters, weavers
or woodworkers. In some areas, there is another group also consid-
ered as non-noble: the captives. Captives were at the bottom of the
social hierarchy and were usually the descendants of war prison-
ers. This group may exhibit some reticence to identify themselves
as captives and are therefore usually underrepresented in surveys
or studies about caste. Griots, artisans and captives have always
constituted a minority of the population. Previous works have esti-
mated the share of griots and artisans to lie between 5% and 20%
depending on the ethnic groups and the captives to represent less
than 5% of the population (Tamari, 1991). Therefore, unlike in
India, the caste system in West Africa is not pyramidal. The nobles
represent the majority of the population. Castes were character-
ized by a strict endogamy, marriages were only allowed within
the caste group. Caste membership is hereditary and rigid and can-
not be changed by any means regardless of economic status, social
mobility or evolution of the division of labor. Importantly, it was
strictly forbidden for nobles to engage in craft jobs or to become
musicians. The former is reserved only for artisans and the latter
for griots. By contrast, griots and artisans were allowed to practice
farming activities. In Senegal, the caste system exists in the whole
country except in the southwest, in a part of the Casamance region.
All of the major ethnic groups in the country (Wolof, Puular, Sereer,
Bambara etc.) have a well-rooted caste system. In Senegal, this his-
torical social division still has a strong imprint in the social life.
With modernity, job occupation in the labor market has been com-
pletely upset, griots and artisans graduate from school and occupy
executive positions. However, the historical social division of labor
still leaves some traces, particularly in rural areas. People from the

royal castes are more likely to occupy village chief positions. Many
griots continue the activities of their ancestors and many artisans
carry out craft activities. It is rare to see individuals from the noble
caste practicing a craft job. Children of griots and artisans some-
times learn skills associated with their caste group. Today, the
caste system is deeply present especially in the marriage market.
Families still manifest deep reluctance to marry a noble to a griot
or an artisan and vice-versa. Even in the political sphere, the caste
system has a strong inﬂuence. Mbow (2000) shows that people
from the griots and artisans caste, struggle to lead political parties
or to win elections. They sometimes even have trouble to being
heard in political meetings because of their caste. In our study area,
the caste system is structured into three groups: the royal caste,
the caste of farmers and the caste of griots and artisans. People
from the royal caste are the descendants of the dynasty of Kelwar,
the only dynasty that could be nominated as king. Griots and arti-
sans constitute the smallest group. Farmers are people with no
royal lineage and not carrying crafts. They may have land rights
or religious authority (see Becker & Martin, 1982 for reference on
caste in this area).

2.3. Data

We use different types of original and comprehensive data col-
lected by the French Research Institute for Development (IRD). The
ﬁrst set of data used in this study is a school monitoring system
implemented between 2001 and 2008. This system recorded every
year whether children attended school or not, and if so their type
of education (classic or Arab-Islamic school) and educational level.
We use this data to compute the school attendance status of chil-
dren and the attendance rate in the social group.

The second type of data we exploit in this paper is a demo-
graphic surveillance system established since 1983 which provides
information on various demographic events such as births, deaths,
and migration, as well as many individual characteristics such as
gender, caste, ethnic group, religion and information on the house-
hold composition. Every child tracked in the school-monitoring
data can be identiﬁed in this demographic surveillance system.
From this latter data set, we have thus merged into the school-
monitoring data, the children’s information for the study period
(2001-2008) and that of their household and social group.

Finally, we use a survey on the standard of living of the house-
holds data conducted in 2003 to build an asset index, an agro-
pastoral wealth index and some characteristics of the household
head (marital status and level of education). The variables taken
from this survey do not vary over time and are speciﬁc to the year
2003.

2.4. Descriptive statistics

The school-monitoring data set covers 9680 children aged 6 to
16 and tracked between 2001 and 2008. Every year, some children
turn 6 years old and enter the sample study and others are over 16
and leave the sample. We exclude children for whom caste group is
unknown and the size of the social group (number of children from
the same caste and village) is less than 10. In the end, 9207 chil-
dren are used in this study and the number of observations
throughout the 8 years is 50463.32% of the children in the study
sample dropped out during the monitoring period (2001-2008).
The majority of these dropouts took place in primary school (86%
in total). The dropouts in middle school are minor (3% drop in total)
and are partly due to the fact that very few children between 6 and
16 manage to reach middle school level.

Changes over time in the school attendance status are quite
common. Among the 2372 children who are observed during

310

and artisans but the attendance rate of the royal caste is signiﬁ-
cantly higher than the attendance rate of the other two castes at
the 1% level (see Table 1).

Simple OLS regressions shown in Table A3 ﬁnd similar results.
When a number of child, household and social group characteris-
tics are introduced in addition to village ﬁxed effects, farmers
and griots and artisans have a signiﬁcantly lower probability of
attending school than children of the royal caste. But there is no
signiﬁcant difference between the caste of farmers and the caste
of griots and artisans.

Simple descriptive statistics for the other variables used in the
analysis are presented in Table A1 and Table A2 in the appendix.
In Table A1, we can see that households are relatively large with
an average of 13 members per household. The average age for chil-
dren in the study sample is about 10.8. 64 social groups are formed
by the combination of the three caste groups and 29 villages (the
three castes are not represented in all villages). Table A2 shows
that Christians are well represented in our study area with about
21.7% of the population while they account for only 5% of the pop-
ulation nationwide. There are slightly more boys than girls (51.5%
vs 48.5%) and almost 15% of children do not live with one of their
biological parents.

Further descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2 which dis-
plays the total population and the average attendance rate for each
of the 29 villages in the study area and for each village-by-caste
cell.

We compute the unconditional Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) and
the conditional Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) using the analysis of
variance estimator. The unconditional ICC is the basic ICC derived
from the analysis of variance in which the binary variable ‘‘attend-
ing school or not” is the outcome and the 64 social groups made up
by the combination of caste and village represent the different
groups. The conditional ICC is computed through two steps. We
ﬁrst predict the residuals of the regression of the binary outcome
on various observable characteristics and then the ICC of the resid-
uals in the 64 social groups is computed. First, the analysis of vari-
ance in both cases shows that the likelihood to attend school is
signiﬁcantly different at the 1% level between social groups
(see Table 3). The unconditional ICC is estimated at 13.75% and
the conditional ICC (the ICC once observable characteristics are
removed) is estimated at 8.69%.

3. Empirical strategy

We argue that social interactions may have a strong effect on
schooling decision. Following the empirical literature on social
interactions, we construct social groups and estimate the impact
of the average schooling behavior of the social group on the prob-
ability of a child attending school. We rely on different identiﬁca-
tion strategies to control
for endogeneity bias. Our basic
assumption is that social interactions go through geographical
proximity and social norms. Geographical proximity is measured
by the residence in the same village and social norms are captured
by the structure of the caste composition. We consider that in gen-
eral, those castes convey identities, norms and traditions that could
have a huge impact on schooling decision. Thus, in our framework,

Fig. 2. Evolution of the school attendance rate by age group.

all the eight years of the study period, 60.6% experienced at
least one change (either drop out or attending school after
being out-of-school the previous year) in their attendance sta-
tus. 38.2% of these 2372 children experienced only one change,
18.6% experienced two changes and 5.8% experienced three
changes.

The average attendance rate during the 2001-2008 period for
children aged 6 to 16 stands at 75.3%. This rate increased markedly
between 2001 and 2004 from 73.4% in 2001 to 83.1% in 2004. From
2005, the attendance rate decreased and had its lowest level in
2006 (67.3%). It recovered slightly in 2007 and 2008 to stand at
69.5% and 71.1% respectively.

The average attendance rate stands at 76.0% for primary school
age children (between 6 and 12) and at 73.7% for middle school age
children (between 13 and 16). In the ﬁrst three years, the atten-
dance rate of the older children was higher than that of the young-
est. This trend is reversed from 2004 to 2008.

The decline in the attendance rate from 2005 appears to be
related to the quality of the data since data from 2005 to 2008
are retrospective data, some enrolled children in this period may
be considered as out of school. In our estimations, we do some
robustness checks using only data from 2001 to 2004 which is of
better quality. Our main conclusions do not change.

In 2001, the attendance rate of the age group 13-16 was much
higher than the attendance rate of the age group 6-12 (see Fig. 2).
This trend is inverted over time. This fact may be explained ﬁrst by
a disastrous agricultural season in 2002 which incite older children
to temporarily migrate to the capital or to other towns or to work
more to help their families cope with this shock. In addition, it
seems to have a drop in the age of entry over time making younger
children be more likely to attend school and older children who
were not enrolled at a younger age less likely to enter school. Chil-
dren are also more likely to drop out of school after completing pri-
mary education.

As regards the distribution of caste groups, more than 3/4 of
children belong to the farmers caste, 16.5% to the royal caste, 5%
are griots or artisans. The attendance rate is the highest for chil-
dren from the royal caste (79.4%), and stands at 74.5% for the farm-
ers caste and the griots and artisans caste. The mean comparison
tests shows that there is no difference between farmers and griots

the combination of villages and castes constitute the social group,

3.1. The empirical model

We estimate the following model to capture the effect of social

interactions on schooling.
yigt ¼ b1 þ b2Xit þ b3Ggt þ b4Yð iÞgt þ ui þ v t  Cg þ igt

ð1Þ
Index i refers to a particular child i; g is the social group and t
indicates the schooling year between 2001-2002 and 2008-2009.
The dependent variable yigt is a dummy variable taking 1 if child

i in social group g at time t attends school and 0 otherwise.

Xit is a vector of individual and household characteristics and

dren), the proportion of Christians and the presence of primary
schools in the village.

Yð iÞgt is the variable of interest and b4 is supposed to capture
the social interactions effect. Yð iÞgt is deﬁned as the mean level
of the attendance rate in the social group excluding child i. It rep-
resents the attendance rate of the other members of the group cal-
culated as the ratio between the number of children that attend
school (without child i) and the total number of children aged
between 6 and 16 minus 1. This measure is known as the leave-
out mean and is currently used in the literature on peer effects
to avoid that the outcome value of an individual i directly inﬂu-
ences the main explanatory variable. Not excluding child i will
overestimate our parameter of interest.

ui are individual-speciﬁc effects that will be considered as ﬁxed.
v t are year ﬁxed effects and Cg is a dummy variable for the com-
mune, a territorial division comprising the villages. The rationale
behind the interaction v t  Cg will be discussed in the identiﬁcation
issues subsection.

it is an idiosyncratic error term of individual i at time t.
The parameters betak are estimated with a Linear Probability
Model (LPM) in a panel data setting with ﬁxed effects. Indeed, as
detailed in Wooldridge (2010), if the main purpose is not to predict
the probability itself that yigt ¼ 1 but rather to approximate the
partial effects of one particular explanatory variable, ‘‘LPM often
does a very good job”. In addition, the LPM allows a more natural
use of ﬁxed effects estimation and make easy the interpretation
of the coefﬁcients.

A ﬁxed effects estimation is used instead of a random effects for
two main reasons. First, ﬁxed effects estimation does not require
the independence between individual ﬁxed effects and the covari-

312

ates that are unlikely to be veriﬁed. Second, the demographic
surveillance system we are using is not a random draw from a
larger population but rather a census of the whole population in
the study area. However, a limitation of the ﬁxed effects model is
that we cannot interpret the impact of some important time-
invariant variables. In appendix A4, we estimate a random effects
model with a complete set of control variables. This regression
allows us to analyze the impact of some time-invariant variables
like the gender of
the child, the dominant religion in the
household and some characteristics computed in a one round
household survey conducted in 2003 such as the level of education
and the marital status of the household’s head, the standard of
living index and the agro-pastoral wealth index computed through
multiple component analysis techniques (see variables used in
Appendix A.1).

Standard errors are clustered at the social group level to
account for heteroscedasticity as well as correlation between indi-
viduals in the same social group and serial correlation. The serial
correlation problem will be further discussed in the next
subsection.

3.2. Identiﬁcation issues

Identiﬁcation of parameters is a great challenge in the study of
peer effects. The coefﬁcient b4 we try to estimate may capture
other phenomena not related to social interactions. Before dis-
cussing the different threats to identiﬁcation, it is worth mention-
ing that the ﬁxed effects estimation helps rule out a number of
endogeneity issues. The individual ﬁxed effects encompass social
group ﬁxed effects and in this way, control for all time-invariant
characteristics of the social group as well as all time-invariant
unobservables that affect schooling in the social group. Similarly,
time-invariant characteristics at a lower level, say at the household
or at the child level, are also controlled. Remaining threats to
identiﬁcation are then time-varying factors that affect simultane-
ously the average schooling in the social group and the schooling
decision of a particular child. We note three key endogeneity
issues.
 In the linear-in-means model, Manski (1993) points out the
reﬂection problem which means that one’s cannot disentangle
the endogenous social interaction effects from the contextual
ones. In this way, a positive and signiﬁcant value of the param-
eter b4 can simply translate the fact that individuals with the
same characteristics X or G behave similarly in their schooling
decision. Brock and Durlauf (2007) show however that in a
non-linear model with a number of assumptions among which
random assignment in different social groups and the absence
of non-observable factors that affect y, the reﬂection problem
is ruled out. Unfortunately, our model is not likely to satisfy
these assumptions.
 It may have a selection bias in the assignment among different
social groups. Unlike the geographical localization, the assign-
ment into different castes can somehow be considered as
exogenous because membership into caste groups depends only
on family lineage. Contrariwise, membership to a village may be
subject to self-selection. People with similar preferences may
live nearby and lead to a dynamic sorting phenomenon. For
example, families or children may tend to migrate to villages
with better schools or better schooling conditions creating an
upward bias to our coefﬁcient of interest.
 A third concern is about omitted variable bias. In fact, factors
that increase or decline school attendance in some villages
may arise over the study period. It is straightforward to imagine
some events that take place during the study period and affect
the overall attendance in the neighborhood. There may be some

infrastructure set up in the village (roads, installations for elec-
triﬁcation, water drilling etc.), development projects that foster
school enrollment or disasters or other bad events that can
reduce enrollment. All such factors artiﬁcially increase the cor-
relation between the average school attendance in the social
group and the attendance status of a child in this group.

Finding good instruments is a great challenge in social inter-
action models since this instrument should be a good predictor
of the average behavior in the social group and should not
affect the enrollment decision of one given child in a channel
other than interactions with her social group members. Studies
which seem to do better with endogeneity bias use randomized
or natural experiments data (Duﬂo & Saez, 2003; Cipollone &
Rosolia, 2007; Bobonis & Finan, 2009; Lalive & Cattaneo, 2009
etc.).

We do not ﬁnd any reliable instrumental variables. Some
solutions to deal with these endogeneity biases are discussed
below.

3.2.1. Reﬂection problem

It is plausible to assume that individuals do not react immedi-
ately to the behavior of their social group but respond with a cer-
tain lag. Manski (1993) afﬁrms that ‘‘it may well be more realistic
to assume some lag in the transmission of these effects”. He further
supports that dynamic model could solve the problem of identify-
ing social interactions.

To understand the reﬂection problem, just take the expectation
that

Eðui þ igtjGgt; Yð iÞgtÞ ¼ 0 we obtain:
EðyigtÞ ¼ b1 þ b2EðXitÞ þ b3Ggt þ b4Yð iÞgt þ v t  Cg

The mean in the social group of Xit can be considered as contex-

tual factors, so EðXitÞ is part of Ggt and EðyigtÞ  Yð iÞgt.

Thus:

Yð iÞgt ¼ b1 þ ðb2 þ b3ÞGgt þ b4Yð iÞgt þ vt  Cg
Yð iÞgt ¼ b1 þ ðb2 þ b3ÞGgt þ vt  Cg

1   b4

ð2Þ

Reﬂection problem arises because there is a linear dependency
between Yð iÞgt and Ggt
in Eq. (2). So there is a co-movement
between Yð iÞgt and Ggt that makes difﬁcult the separation of the
contextual effects and the endogenous social interactions.

The dynamic model is simply written as follows:
yigt ¼ b1 þ b2Xit þ b3Ggt þ b4Yð iÞgt 1 þ ui þ v t  Cg þ igt

ð3Þ
The probability of child i in social group g is no more affected by
the contemporaneous behavior of the group but by its previous
behavior. This model helps greatly circumvent the reﬂection
problem.

Indeed by the same calculations as previously (taking the
such as

and let

expectation of
Yð iÞgt 1 ¼ LYð iÞgt we obtain:
Yð iÞgt ¼ b1 þ ðb2 þ b3ÞGgt þ vt  Cg

1   Lb4

ð4Þ

We no longer have a linear dependency between Yð iÞgt and Ggt,

so the reﬂection problem is ﬁgured out.

Indeed, following Blume et al. (2011) ‘‘dynamic analogs of the

linear in means model may not exhibit the reﬂection problem”.

However, in Eq. (3), serial correlation may be an important
issue. Yð iÞgt and Yð iÞgt 1 can be correlated due to the correlation

A.S. Gueye et al. / World Development 110 (2018) 307–323

313

between igt and igt 1. To deal with this issue, we cluster standard
errors at the social group level.4 This clustering structure accounts
both for the correlation of an individual over time as well as the cor-
relation between individuals in the same social group. Clustering
standard errors is robust to cross sectional heteroscedasticity and
serial correlation within panel when the time dimension is short
enough compared to the number of observations (Bertrand, Duﬂo,
& Mullainathan, 2004; Angrist & Pischke, 2008; Wooldridge, 2010).
In this paper, we have 9207 observations and only 8 years, so this
condition seems to be widely respected. We also have 64 social
groups suggesting that the number of clusters is sufﬁciently large
for the cluster robust method to be valid.

3.2.2. Self selection

An important issue in estimating peer effects or social interac-
tions is that groups or networks may not be made up randomly.
It is the selection problem. In our particular case, the correlation
between the average behavior in the social group and the speciﬁc
behavior of a member of this group is likely driven by some unob-
servables that explain also the non-random assignment in the
groups.

To assess this issue in our empirical analysis, recall ﬁrst the def-
inition of a social group in our context. Individuals within the same
caste and the same village belong to the same social group. As
mentioned previously, caste can be considered as exogenous, peo-
ple belong to a particular caste since birth. And importantly, caste
membership is ﬁxed and cannot change over time by no means.
Due to the presence of ﬁxed effects in our model, only time-
variant characteristics can represent a threat to identiﬁcation.
Therefore, the source of selection bias comes necessarily from
non-random assignment over time into different villages known
as dynamic sorting. For instance, a given village can have some
potentiality for agro-pastoral activities attracting children from
other villages to work. These children are then less likely to attend
school. On another side, children may move to villages with better
schooling environments. All these possible migration patterns are
sources of selection bias in the assignment of social groups.

Fortunately, we have data on migration between villages during
the study period. Migration to the capital or other towns seems to
be a minor concern in this context. Even though this type of migra-
tion is widespread in the study area, it is essentially temporary,5 so
those migrants are very likely to be recorded in our data.

Migration between the different villages in the study area is rel-
atively low as shown in Fig. 3. The internal immigration rate which
is the proportion of children aged between 6 and 16 who migrate
from one of the 29 villages of the study area to another village of
the study area is around 2% and ﬂuctuates very little over time.
These ﬁgures tend to show that dynamic sorting does not seem
to be a major concern.

In addition, we control for total inﬂows (immigration) and total
outﬂows (emigration) in robustness checks to assess the sensibility
of results when these population movements are taken into account.

3.2.3. Omitted Variables

Time-varying unobservable shocks that affect schooling in a
given social group is one of the main threat to identiﬁcation. Esti-
mating Eq. (1) is misleading if uncontrolled factors affect the aver-
age attendance rate in the social group. In this case, these factors

4 Clustering standard errors at the individual

level accounts for the serial
correlation problem but does not account for the correlation of individuals in the
same social group. Clustering at the individual level yields smaller standard errors
and is then less conservative to the cluster at the social group level.

5 Students and particularly girls go to the capital city during the summer holidays
after the sowing period but return to their home villages at the start of the school
year.

year.

will inﬂuence the individual attendance probability as well and
b4 will not only capture peer effects. Lacking good instrumental
variables, we will rely on different empirical strategies to convince
that our results are not driven by unobservable shocks.

First, instead of including only year ﬁxed effects in our regres-
sion, we include year multiplied by commune ﬁxed effects. Com-
munes are the smallest territorial division after the districts in
urban area. In rural area, the equivalent of communes are called
‘‘communautés rurales” in French and the equivalent of districts
are villages. The 29 villages in the study area are divided into
two rural communes: 17 villages belong to the rural commune of
Ngayokhéme and 12 villages belong to the rural commune of Diar-
rére. The interaction between commune and year ﬁxed effects
allows controlling for all time-varying factors common to all vil-
lages in the same commune. We believe that this set of ﬁxed
effects helps reduce omitted variables problem. In fact, villages in
the same commune share some geographical shocks and also some
consequences of policy actions taken at the commune level, for
instance, setting infrastructures, sensitization campaigns, social
policies etc. Of course, unobservable shocks within the commune
may still be a concern.

Second, in robustness checks, we replace our main variable of
interest the average attendance rate in the social group Yð iÞgt with
the difference between the average attendance rate in the caste
Yð iÞcvt and the average attendance in the village Yð iÞvt.6 We believe
that omitted variable bias can only come from factors that affect the
schooling behavior in the whole village. It is difﬁcult to imagine how
some unobservables can affect one particular caste in a village with-
out affecting the others. The idea of this difference is to rule out any
village component of the average attendance rate in the social group.
The difference Yð iÞcvt   Yð iÞvt corresponds then to the gap between
the schooling attendance in the caste and the school attendance in
the village. A positive (negative) value of this difference means that
the average attendance in the caste is above (below) the village aver-
age. Although this speciﬁcation emphasizes the speciﬁc role of caste
in social interactions and de-emphasizes the neighborhood effects,
we feel comfortable in the fact that it allows removing many con-
founding factors.

Third, we run some kind of placebo tests to ﬁgure out whether
our results are driven by omitted variables. In a ﬁrst placebo test,
we estimate the impact of the schooling behavior of other castes
in the same village. In the presence of geographical confounding

6 index c refers to the caste and v to the village.

314

factors, we expect the attendance rate of other castes in the same
village to be correlated with individual attendance decision. In a
second placebo test, we estimate the impact of the attendance rate
of the same caste group in other villages. This test allows us to
check whether our deﬁnition of social group is accurate.

group for the previous year inﬂuences the probability for a child
to attend school. Control variables are included step by step. The
reported F-statistic tests the null hypothesis that the model we
estimated does not ﬁt the sample better than the model with only
a constant. A signiﬁcant F-test means that the explanatory vari-
ables are jointly signiﬁcant. In all speciﬁcations, the lagged atten-
dance rate has a positive and signiﬁcant impact at the 1% level
on the probability to attend school. The magnitude of the coefﬁ-
cient decreases when control variables are introduced. In column
1 where no control variables are included, a one percent increase
in the lagged attendance rate increases the probability to attend
school by 0.41 percentage points. In column 2, individual and
household characteristics are included and the coefﬁcient of inter-
est decreases markedly and stands at 0.30. Social group character-
istics included in column 3 reduce to a lesser extent the magnitude
of the point estimate. Our preferred speciﬁcation is in column 4
which includes all control variables in addition to the interaction
of year and commune ﬁxed effects. These ﬁxed effects account
for all time-variant factors that similarly affect villages in the same

commune. The impact of the lagged attendance rate in the social
group declines slightly but remains positive and statistically signif-
icant at the 1% level. A one percent increase in the attendance rate
of the social group in the previous year makes the child 0.27 per-
centage points more likely to go to school. With a one standard
deviation increase in the lagged attendance rate, the increase in
the probability to attend school reaches 4.17 percentage points.
This evidence shows that social interactions play an important role
in the attendance decision.

Fig. 4 plots the predictive probability to attend school by the
lagged attendance rate in the social group. The x-axis indicates
the average lagged attendance rate for each quintile category.
The curve exhibits the positive relation between the attendance
rate at year t-1 and the probability of schooling at t. A child who
belongs to a social group in the ﬁrst quintile in terms of school
attendance has a probability of 70.6% to attend school the next
year. This probability is 81.0% for a child from a social group in
the upper quintile of school attendance, an increase of 10.4 per-
centage points more compared to a child from the lowest quintile.
Regarding the results on the control variables, the size of the
household, the number of adult women and the number of chil-
dren under 5 years old have no signiﬁcant impact on the probabil-
ity to go to school. Attendance decision is negatively correlated
with the fact that the household is headed by a woman, suggesting
that children who live in households headed by a woman are less
likely to attend school. The fact that the household is headed by a
woman is potentially related to many other factors as the vulner-
ability of the household (for instance due to death or absence of
the husband), lack of workforce, poverty etc. So it is difﬁcult to
go beyond simple correlation in interpreting this result.

The age dummies suggest an inverse U-shaped relationship
between age and attendance. The probability of attending school
is always positive compared to children who are 6 years old. This
probability increases until the age of ten when it reaches its max-
imum and then decreases. The attendance probability decreases
when peers are older and this effect is signiﬁcant at the 1% level
in our preferred speciﬁcation. The number of school-age children
has a negative impact on the likelihood to go to school but the
effect disappears with the introduction of year times commune
ﬁxed effects. The total population, the proportion of Christians
and the presence of schools have no signiﬁcant impact.

4.2. Heterogeneity

The heterogeneity of the impact of social interactions is studied
in Table 5 regarding the gender and the age of the child and the study

period. The point estimate is 0.24 for boys and 0.30 for girls. Girls
seem to be more affected by the average behavior of the social group
than boys, but the two point estimates are not statistically different.
Primary-school age children (aged between 6 and 12) are
strongly inﬂuenced by social interactions with a point estimate
of 0.22 signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Contrariwise, middle-school
age children are not affected by the average schooling behavior
in the social group. This ﬁnding suggests that the decision to enroll
a young child in primary school is guided to some extent by the
average schooling in the social group but school dropout or school
enrollment for older children is independent of the group behavior.
In the last column of Table 5, we split the study period and run
an estimation only for the period 2001-2004. As mentioned previ-
ously, there appears to be a clear difference in data quality
between the ﬁrst half of the study period (2001-2004) and the
remainder of the period (2005-2008). Unlike the ﬁrst half of the
period, data from 2005-2008 were collected in a retrospective
way, and therefore seem less precise. Thus, some enrolled children
appear to have been recorded as out of school explaining the
decline in the attendance rate in 2005. The point estimate for the
sub-period 2001-2004 declines to 0.16 but remains high and statis-
tically signiﬁcant at the 5% level.

4.3. Robustness checks

The positive and high impact of social interactions could be dri-
ven by some confounding factors correlated with the schooling
behavior in the social group. As discussed in the empirical strategy,
dynamic sorting and geographical omitted variables can represent
important threats to identiﬁcation. To control for dynamic sorting,
we control for annual inﬂows and outﬂows between villages in the
study area for children aged between 6 and 16. Controlling for
these migration patterns will allow accounting for the fact that
people can change social groups over time. These results are shown
in Table 6. Column 1 presents the baseline results in Table 4. In col-
umn 2, we introduce annual inﬂows and outﬂows between vil-
lages. The magnitude of the point estimate is nearly the same
and always signiﬁcant at the 1% level. This suggests that dynamic
sorting does not impact our results and consolidates the previous
evidence in graph 3 that migration ﬂows between villages are
low and do not represent a major concern. Furthermore, children
inﬂows and outﬂows in the village have no signiﬁcant impact on
the probability to attend school.

Confounding factors in the village level are potentially impor-
tant sources of endogeneity bias. To deal with this issue, the aver-
age attendance in the social group is replaced by the average
attendance level in the social group minus the average attendance
level in the village. This difference as detailed in the identiﬁcation
issues section allows us to remove all the village components of
the average attendance rate in the social group. Using this differ-
ence as variable of interest, the point estimate declines slightly
but does not change much. From 0.27 in the baseline regression,
the point estimate falls to 0.26 and is signiﬁcant at the 5% level.
In column 4 of Table 6, migration ﬂows are included and the coef-
ﬁcient remains roughly the same. It is worth mentioning that this
estimation puts a lot of emphasis on social interactions through
caste membership. Geographical interactions in this method play
a minor role. The large size of the coefﬁcient implies that social
group behavior actually inﬂuences the individual decision about
schooling even when factors driving the average attendance level
in the village are ruled out.

The results presented in this section show that even when non-
random assignment into social groups and geographical confound-
ing factors are taken into account, the main conclusion of positive
and signiﬁcant impact of social interactions remains.

Other robustness checks are presented in appendix. In Table A4,
we estimate a random effects model. This model allows us to con-
sider the individual speciﬁc effects as random, to include social
group ﬁxed effects and to assess the impact of other ﬁxed control
variables. The point estimate is high without social group ﬁxed
effects but falls to 0.29 when they are included. In Table A6, a mul-
tilevel model is presented with two levels: the children and the
social groups. This regression provides a more general way to
model the non-dependency between individuals in the same social
group. Thus, social groups and individuals are both considered as
random effects. The coefﬁcient of the lagged attendance rate
stands at 0.29. In both the random effects and the multilevel

model, the impact of social interactions is close to the 0.27 point
estimate found in our baseline regression.

Griots and artisans constitute the smallest caste group in terms
of size. We then wonder if excluding them from the analysis could
change the results. In Table A7 in appendix, we restrict the analysis
to the farmers and the royal caste. Results are overall very similar
to what we obtain by considering the three caste groups.

4.4. Placebo tests

We run two different tests similar to placebos by modifying the
deﬁnition of social groups. The ﬁrst test is to capture the impact on

attendance probability of the other caste groups in the same vil-
lage. The second test is about assessing the impact on attendance
of the average attendance level of children within the same caste
group but living in other villages.7

If our results are driven by geographical confounding factors,
we expect the schooling behavior of other castes in the same vil-
lage to signiﬁcantly impact the probability to go to school. Table 7
shows how each caste group is affected by its own average atten-
dance rate in the village as well as the attendance rate of other
castes in the same village. A child who belongs to the farmers caste
is not affected by the average attendance rate of other farmers in
the same village and is not affected either by the other two castes.
Griots and artisans are inﬂuenced by the average attendance of
other griots and artisans in the same village, with a point estimate
of 0.20 signiﬁcant at the 10% level, but are not inﬂuenced by the
farmers and the royal caste. The set of results for the royal caste
is more complex and raises interesting insights. First, social inter-
actions appear to be much more important for members of the
royal caste. A one percent increase in the lagged attendance rate
of other children from royal caste in the village induces an increase
of 0.43 percentage points of the probability to attend school. This
magnitude is 1.6 times higher than that of the overall impact of
social group schooling behavior and is signiﬁcant at the 1% level.
Furthermore, children from the royal caste are negatively and sig-
niﬁcantly affected by the schooling behavior of farmers. The
impact of griots and artisans on the royal caste is also negative
but non signiﬁcant. This ﬁnding suggests that people from the
royal caste tend to behave in the opposite way in terms of school-
ing compared to others. The negative impact of farmers on royal
caste does seem to be a simple correlation due to the fact that chil-
dren from the royal caste are more enrolled than the others. Recall
that it is the lagged (and not the contemporaneous) attendance
rate of farmers that negatively affects children from the royal caste.
In addition, if this relationship was simply a pure correlation, we
would probably ﬁnd a negative impact of the royal caste on the
other two castes as well, which is not the case. The royal caste is
considered as the upper level in the social hierarchy and this
may explain a wish to not comply with the social norm of the other
castes. However, a better knowledge of the context and perhaps
some qualitative or anthropological studies are probably needed
to better understand this issue.

In brief, these ﬁndings suggest that confounding factors at
the village level do not seem to be driving our basic result of
a positive impact of social interactions, but that there is actually
a group effect across
schooling
behavior.

the caste that

inﬂuences

Fig. 5 shows how the inﬂuence of social group behavior is more
important inside the royal caste compared to the other two castes.
The predictive probability to attend school for each caste group
derived from the regressions in Table 7 is represented in the y-
axis. The x-axis displays the ﬁve quintile groups of the average
lagged attendance rate. A child from the royal caste, whose atten-
dance rate of other royal caste children in his/her village is in the
lowest quintile, is 66% likely to attend school compared to 84%
for a royal caste child in the highest quintile, a difference of 18 per-
centage points in the probability to attend school. For farmers and
griots and artisans, this probability gap between the bottom and
the top quintile of the attendance rate of their peers is 7 percentage
points, much smaller than that of the royal caste.

In the second placebo test shown in Table 8, we study the
impact of the average attendance rate of children from the same
caste living in other villages. Surprisingly, the lagged attendance

caste to another as suggested in (Jacoby & Mansuri, 2015) and as we ﬁnd below.

rate of farmers in other villages has a negative impact on the atten-
dance probability of farmers. However, for royal caste and griots
and artisans, there is no signiﬁcant impact of the schooling atten-
dance of children from the same caste in the other villages. These
results reinforce our view that the deﬁnition of social group we use
is appropriate. The relevant network where the interactions take
place is actually made up of individuals from the same village
and the same caste. The negative point estimate we ﬁnd for farm-

ers is somehow puzzling and perhaps deserves further knowledge
of the context to ﬁgure out what it really contains. We suggest
three possible explanations. First, these results should be taken
with caution because the coefﬁcients in these three regressions
are very imprecise. Both the standard errors and the coefﬁcients
are very high reﬂecting a miss-speciﬁcation problem. This miss-
speciﬁcation problem is likely due to the very small variability of
the explanatory variables used in these estimations. In fact, the
average attendance of children from the same caste in the other
villages does not vary much from one village to another. Second,
the farmer’s caste group is the largest and the most heterogeneous
compared to the other two castes. Thus, social norms inside this
caste are not so strong and interactions are more likely to occur
in the neighborhood. Our last explanation is more technical and
relates to what Caeyers and Fafchamps (2016) have called the
exclusion bias. This is the mechanical negative relationship
between the characteristics of an individual and those of their
peers simply because ‘‘individuals cannot be their own peers” as
noted by Guryan, Kroft, and Notowidigdo (2009). For instance, if
farmers in a particular village have the highest school attendance
rate, this means that the overall attendance rate of farmers in other
villages is lower. As a result, the attendance rate in this high-
performing village will be negatively correlated to that of other vil-
lages. This exclusion bias probably explains the negative but not
signiﬁcant point estimate for the royal caste and griots and
artisans.

Although we cannot claim that we estimate a pure causality of
peer effects, the different robustness checks and placebo tests
implemented allow us to rule out a number of alternative explana-
tions. Nevertheless, social interactions can operate through differ-
ent channels and identifying these channels can be particularly
useful for policymakers as well as for research purpose. As noted
by Sacerdote (2011): ‘‘Identifying the precise channel through
which a given peer effect operates is a Herculean task and in many
cases is asking too much of the data” (P. 251).

Lacking data to empirically address the various channels of
social interactions, we try to issue a number of hypotheses to
understand what our positive social group effect contains. Our ﬁrst
interpretation is that these positive effects reﬂect social norms. As
explained above, there may be a signiﬁcant social component in
the utility function of individuals. Social categories convey norms,
and deviating from these norms engenders costs. Our deﬁnition of
social groups supports this hypothesis. One of the main character-
istics of caste groups is to transmit ways of thinking. Despite mod-
ernization and the loss of power of these traditional forms of social
identity and organization, many of their cultural aspects still have
great importance today, particularly in some rural areas. On
another side, villages can also have different norms. Geographical
proximity and the identity carried by the membership to a certain
village can explain why people of the same village behave similarly
in accordance with the prevailing norms.

Another transmission channel can simply be a ripple effect phe-
nomenon. People often behave like other members of their social
group in response to fads or trends, for example. Simply seeing
many children in the social group attending school could motivate
a particular parent to send his or her child to school as well. Similar
behaviors are observed in other well-known contexts in our every-
day lives like choosing a particular restaurant for dinner, adopting
new technology or even voting a certain way. People tend to imi-
tate what others do and this behavior is shown by some theoretical
papers as being rational. The seminal paper by Banerjee (1992)
gives an explanation of why people are inﬂuenced by what others
do and introduces the concept of ‘‘herd behavior” as ‘‘everyone
doing what everyone else is doing, even when their private infor-
mation suggests doing something quite different”. In this model,
people believe that others have some information that leads them
to behave in a particular way – for example enrolling their children
– and so it is rational to imitate them. The importance of the ripple
effect has also been observed in a slightly different context. Kone
et al. (2015) show that living in rich neighborhoods, drives poor
households to comply with health and social norms.

A third channel could be the perception of the returns to educa-
tion in the social group. If individuals notice that better educated
people in their social category are wealthier, this may encourage
them to go to school (or to enroll their children to school).
Lincove (2015) in a recent study in Nigeria and Uganda ﬁnds that
18% of out-of-school children in Nigeria and 13% in Uganda report
not going to school due to a low return to education. Jensen (2010)
in a study in the Dominican Republic ﬁnds that students’ expecta-
tions on their returns to education are very low and providing
them information on the true returns to education sharply
increases the number of completed years of education over the
next four years. Attanasio and Kaufmann (2014) show in Mexico
that monetary expected returns are a strong determinant to enter
in college particularly for boys, but also mother’s expectations
about unemployment risk as well as earnings risk (measured by
the variance of earnings) signiﬁcantly reduce the probability to
attend college for girls. It appears then that the perception of the
monetary beneﬁts of schooling, as well as the perception of the

A.S. Gueye et al. / World Development 110 (2018) 307–323

319

probability to ﬁnd a good job, play an important role in educational
decisions.

5. Conclusion

We exploit a rich data set from Niakhar, a rural zone in Senegal
to study how social interactions affect educational decision. Peer
effects in education are widely studied in the literature but many
of these studies analyze learning outcomes in the classroom con-
text and few have looked into what happens in the case of sub-
Saharan Africa. Our paper differs in the sense that we study how
social group schooling behavior inﬂuences the decision to attend
school for children in rural Senegal. Social groups are deﬁned with
caste membership and geographical proximity. Caste norms repre-
sent a key element in the customs and in the social organization in
some countries in West Africa and particularly in Senegal. Unfortu-
nately, caste in Senegal appears to be understudied. We, therefore,
contribute to the economic literature by studying one aspect of the
caste system, namely norms and attitudes toward education. Iden-
tiﬁcation is an important challenge when it comes to disentangling
the effects of social group behavior. We take advantage of the panel
structure of our data to estimate a dynamic model and to control
for ﬁxed characteristics of individuals and social groups. We also
implement different tests to convince that non-random assign-
ment into social groups and geographical unobserved factors are
not threats to the validity of our results, even though we cannot
fully claim that our effect is entirely causal.

Our ﬁnding suggests that the usual economic determinants of
schooling are not enough to explain school attendance. The proba-
bility to attend school increases between 0.25 and 0.29 percentage
points with a 1% increase of the previous average attendance rate
in the social group. Thus, schooling behavior in the social group
explains a large portion of the attendance decision. Social interac-

tions matter and should be considered when implementing educa-
tional policies.

While we use the combination of caste and village membership
to construct social categories, one can assume that schooling deci-
sions may be guided by the whole social network. Thus, more pre-
cise data on social connections between households would allow
analyzing for further, how social interactions can shift children’s
school attendance.

bottom at the table strongly rejects the model with one-level ordinary linear
regression in favor of a multi-level regression.

about housing characteristics and possession of goods. The spec-
trum of correlations show that variables about goods and equip-
ment and those about agro-pastoral activities seem to be
negatively correlated: households with good housing characteris-
tics and good facilities have less livestock and farming equipment
and vice versa. So we run afterward two MCA separating these
two aspects and eliminating variables with lesser contributions
on the axes. These two MCA allow us to compute an indicator
of good and equipment and an indicator of agro-pastoral wealth.
The variables used in the construction of the indicator of goods
and equipment are:

Variables used in the building of the goods and equipment
index
Number of rooms owned by the household
⁄
Percentage of rooms whose ﬂoor is in: 1. Banco
2. Cement
Percentage of rooms whose wall is in: 1. Banco 2. Cement
Percentage of rooms whose roof is in: 1. Straw 2. Metal sheet
Owning : 1. Gas cooker 2. TV
Owning at least one of the following good: phone, car,

refrigerator, solar panel

Access to a latrine
Source of water supply

⁄

Traditional building material made of mud and straw

Variables used in the building of the agro-pastoral wealth
index:
Owning: 1. Seeder 2. Cart 3. Horse 4. Shelling machine 5. Hoe
Owning: 1. Poultry 2. Small-stock 3. Large cattle
Practice of livestock fattening
