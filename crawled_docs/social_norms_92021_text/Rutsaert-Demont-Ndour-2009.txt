Abstract 
This  study  investigates  how  the  Senegalese  consumer  values  quality  rice.  We  use  Vickrey 
second  price  auctions  to  elicit  the  willingness-to-pay  (WTP)  to  exchange  mediocre  Senegal 
River  Valley  (SRV)  rice  into  unlabeled  quality  SRV  rice,  labeled  (Rival)  quality  SRV  rice  and 
labeled  (Thai-25)  imported  rice.  We  include  experimental  interaction  between  participants  by 
introducing  the  concept  of  collective  willingness-to-pay  (CWTP)  through  consensus  sessions. 
The participants are willing to pay an 80 percent higher price premium for local quality rice than 
for imported rice. This indicates that the local quality rice brand Rival is able to compete against 
imported rice. Bids are influenced by tasting and the time  of the day  during which the rice is 
auctioned;  socio-demographic  variables  have  very  little  influence  on  bids.  Remarkably,  in 
contrast  to  individual  bids,  collective  consensus  exhibits  a  significantly  positive  label  effect. 
These findings are important for designing labeling and marketing strategies and provide useful 
information  for  rice  traders,  retailers  and  local  rice  farmers  in  the  Senegal  River  Valley  and 
national  policy  makers  who  are  currently  implementing  an  ambitious  food  self-sufficiency 
program. Understanding the group estimation process was a second goal of our research and 
the results show that age is an important factor in collective decision-making. The latter provides 
useful information for designing collective value chain and generic promotion strategies through 
exploiting social capital and networks.

Competitive Rivals: Willingness-to-pay for Senegal River Valley versus Imported Rice 

Establishing efficient value chains is cited by the World Bank as a first policy objective in making 

agriculture  in  developing  countries  more  competitive  and  more  effective  in  supporting 

sustainable  growth  and  reducing  poverty  (World  Bank  2008,  pp.  19,  228).  In  an  increasingly 

competitive  global  agri-food  environment,  businesses  that  are  adept  at  meeting  the  needs  of 

consumers will survive and grow. Hobbs, Cooney and Fulton (2000) argue that it is the demand-

driven strategy which distinguishes value chains from traditional business relationships. Hence, 

the value that consumers attribute to the product in the end-market is the starting point for value 

chain research. 

Food production in Senegal has doubled since 1960 but due to the country’s high level 

of  population  growth,  per  capita  food  production  has  fallen  by  almost  50  percent  (Brüntrup, 

Nguyen  and  Kaps  2006).  No  other  country  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  is  so  dependent  on  food 

imports.  Rice  imports  into  Senegal,  particularly,  consist  almost  entirely  of  broken  rice.  In 

international  markets,  broken  rice  is  considered  an  inferior  product  and  is  therefore  much 

cheaper  than  whole-grain  rice.  However,  Senegalese  consumers  have  developed  a  marked 

preference for imported broken rice. Even in major rice production regions, such as Saint-Louis, 

urban  consumers  are  paying  price  premiums  averaging  15%  relative  to  mixed-grain  rice 

produced in the Senegal River Valley (SRV) as Figure 1 shows. Because of its dominance, in 

this study we focus on broken rice, termed simply ‘rice’ hereafter for brevity. 

A 2007 study surveyed 500 households in Senegal and found that the most important 

consumer determinants for rice were taste, swelling capacity, ease of cooking and the form of 

the grain (Fall and Diagne 2008). Recently, perhaps triggered by high international rice prices, 

value  chain  strategies  are  emerging  in  the  SRV,  where  producers  have  now  joined  efforts  in 

2 

 

supplying  a  new  enhanced-quality  SRV  rice  brand  Rival  (Riz  de  la  Vallée).  Governance  of 

quality (processing, cleaning and packaging) and provision of micro-financing is conducted by 

the recent Oxfam-funded initiative PINORD (Programme d’appui aux Initiatives du Nord). 

The purpose of our study is to analyze the willingness to pay (WTP) for this new product 

and for its Lancasterian attributes (visual and sensory quality and authenticity/locally produced 

image). The study consists in a first step and feeds into a larger research framework on value 

chain  development  and  generic  advertizing  with  the  aims  of  increasing  competitiveness  and 

self-sufficiency  of  the  SSA  rice  sector  and  reducing  food  insecurity  and  poverty.  More 

specifically,  we  are  interested  in  the  value  added  and  competitiveness  of  quality  SRV  rice 

compared to conventional SRV rice and imported rice. 

We compared the WTP for four different rice qualities/labels on the Saint-Louis market: 

(i) conventional SRV rice (benchmark), (ii) unlabeled quality SRV rice, (iii) labeled (Rival) quality 

SRV rice and (iv) labeled (Thai-25) imported rice. Harrison and Rutström (2008) demonstrated 

that  in  stated  preference  methods  participants  typically  overstate  their  WTP.  To  avoid  this 

positive bias, we used an experimental auction market designed to elicit real differences in WTP 

between the benchmark rice and three alternative rice types. Because real products and real 

money  are  exchanged  in  an  experimental  setting,  participants  have  increased  incentives  to 

reveal their true value for a product.1 In a seminal paper, Shogren et al. (1994) described the 

basic procedure. We used the conventional local mediocre-quality rice as a benchmark and we

offered  it  as  an  endowment  at  the  beginning of  the  experiment.  Then  we  elicited  consumers’ 

WTP to exchange this endowment for three alternative rice types. 

This  article  contributes  to  the  experimental  auction  literature  on  two  points.  First,  we 

conduct  an  experimental  auction  on  food  in  a  poor,  least  developed  country  (LDC)  under 

challenging conditions of high illiteracy, limited technical possibilities and low education levels. 

With the exception of Masters and Sanogo (2002), no similar market experiments have been 

published in the context of LDCs. While their study is based on a choice experiment, we use the 

auction mechanism as  methodology to elicit WTP values.  Surprisingly, very few experimental 

auctions  have  been  published  on  developing  countries,  where  consumers  are  usually  more 

acquainted  with  negotiable  prices  and  the  market  system,  and  are,  therefore,  more  used  to 

conforming  their  WTP  to  the  food  sellers’  willingness-to-accept  (WTA)  than  consumers  in 

developed countries. Moreover, these consumers typically spend larger shares of their budgets 

on  food  and  demand  for  food  is  more  elastic.  In  other  words,  they  respond  more  actively  to 

market  prices  necessitating  frequent  cognitive  efforts  to  estimate  their  WTP  and  a  better 

knowledge of market prices as the latter directly affect their welfare. 

Secondly,  we  include  experimental  interaction  between  participants  by  introducing  the 

concept of collective willingness-to-pay (CWTP) and, hence, bridging the economic literature on 

experimental  auctions  with  the  psychological  literature  on  random  ad  hoc  groups  and  social 

decision schemes (SDS) that originated with Davis’ (1973) seminal article. To our knowledge, 

the gap between these two distinct disciplinary fields has never been bridged so far. The only 

exception,  and  most  closely  related  study,  is  the  paper  of  Maciejovsky  and  Budescu  (2007), 

who  compared  cooperative  groups  and  competitive  auctions  and  concluded  that  competitive 

auctions  induce  learning  effects  equally  impressive  as  those  of  standard  group  interactions. 

However, the authors oppose both methods and completely separate them in their experimental 

4 

 

setting by using two distinct samples, while we combine both methods in a single experiment on 

a  single  sample  and  generate  novel  information  on  the  interaction  between  both  methods. 

Moreover, the authors do not directly use the data generated by the auctions, but only use the 

latter to create competitive decision settings among subjects. 

Three  strategic  considerations  led  us  to  introduce  collective  interaction  into  our 

experiment.  First,  studies  on  group  decisions  revealed  that  groups  significantly  outperform 

individuals  in  the  estimation  of  judgmental  variables  (Bonner,  Sillito  and  Baumann  2007; 

Sniezek  and  Henry  1989).  Given  this  bias  argument,  understanding  the  group  estimation 

process  is  of  clear  relevance  to  social  science  and  to  organizations.  Secondly,  this  study  is 

embedded in a larger framework of experimental value chain research, in which it is believed 

that  competitiveness  of  the  food  sector  in  developing  countries  can  be  increased  through 

collective value chain and generic promotion strategies exploiting, to a maximum extent, social 

capital  and  networks.  Finally,  rice  is  the  most  important  staple  crop  in  Senegal  and  more 

important in relative terms to the poorest tercile of consumers than to the richest in urban areas 

(Reardon  1993).  Food  security  and  self-sufficiency  are  public  goods  and,  hence,  social 

normative processes in perceived quality and buying intentions (Obermiller and Spangenberg 

1989) may be successfully deployed in generic promotion programs of local SRV rice. 

Material and methods 

We conducted 10 sessions during 5 days in the youth center of Saint-Louis, which is close to 

the central market. We randomly selected women, going to and returning from the market, on 

the spot and as soon as we had recruited 10 participants, we started the auction. Tomlins et al. 

(2007)  observed  that  women  are  the  most  important  decision  makers  in  rice  purchase.  This 

makes them the target group of our experiment. In our trial session, we offered a participation 

5 

 

fee of 2,000 FCFA. Because of a low participation rate, we raised the fee to 3,000 FCFA, which 

boosted  the  participation  rate  to  approximately  50  percent,  i.e.  at  this  fee  urban  consumers 

were, on average, indifferent between participating and non-participating.2 We maintained this 

fee for the rest of the sessions and omitted the trial session in our experimental results. 

We ran three auctions simultaneously following Melton et al. (1996) and Roosen et al. 

(1998). Analogously to the latter, we used a fixed benchmark, i.e. conventional mixed-grain SRV 

rice. In terms of quality and price, this rice type is inferior to the three alternatives in the auction. 

Lusk et al. (2004) noticed a difference in subjects’ bids between multiple-good and single-good 

valuation.  We  follow  Alfnes  and  Rickertsen  (2003)  who  argue  that  bidding  on  all  alternatives 

simultaneously  is  an  efficient  method  for  eliciting  WTP  differences:  “[…]  all  bids can  be  used 

and,  furthermore,  the  complete  distribution  of  WTP  differences  can  be  elicited  in  one 

experiment.” (p. 399). 

We  chose  the  Vickrey  (1961)  second-price  auction  mechanism,  because  of  its  weakly 

dominant strategy for the participants to bid their true value for the good. With our interest on 

low value individuals, Lusk and Rousu (2007) suggest that the BDM auction is likely to provide 

more accurate depictions of true WTP than the second-price auction. However, in our context of 

high illiteracy and low education levels, we preferred the second price auction mechanism as it 

is easier to understand. We did not use any manuals or monitors and conducted the experiment 

orally in the national languages Wolof and Pulaar. 

                                                     
 

 

2  At  the  time  of  the  experiments  (November  2008),  the  currency  rate  was  $1  =  469  FCFA  and  hence 

3,000 FCFA = $6. 

 

6 

Each  participant  was  endowed  with  one  kilogram  of  the  conventional  local  mediocre-

quality mixed-grain rice and had the opportunity to exchange this kilo into the three alternative 

rice types, described above. The benchmark rice is a mix of varieties (Sahel 108 and 201) and 

commonly  available  on  the  market.  The  imported  Thai-25  has  a  grain  quality  somewhere 

between  the  benchmark  and  the  high-quality  SRV  rice  and  contains  some  impurities.  The 

unlabeled and labeled rice types are equal, i.e. high-quality SRV rice (Sahel 108 variety) which 

is purified and carefully shifted. 

Halfway the session, we included a taste treatment of the four rice types and at the end 

we  conducted  a  short  survey  through  a  one-page  questionnaire  to  collect  socio-demographic 

data. We planned the survey after the auction experiment to avoid revealing too much about the 

study’s objectives (Corrigan and Rousu 2008). 

We  paid  considerable  attention  to  explaining  and  training  the  mechanism.  Following 

Shogren  et  al.  (1994),  we  used  commonly  known  brands  of  biscuits  to  familiarize  the 

participants with the Vickrey auction. Each participant received a small package of biscuits and 

was asked to bid for two alternative, superior types of biscuits. We conducted two rounds with 

an  evaluation  after  each  round  to  check  whether  the  participants  understood  the  system  and 

whether more clarification was needed. We learned from the trial session that WTP difference 

estimates  were  more  reliable  after  calibration  and  hence  before  the  first  bidding  round  we 

posted the absolute market price of the benchmark rice, but did not reveal and kindly asked the 

subjects not to reveal any price information on the alternative rice types. Secondly, we used the 

analogy of buying new jewelry in exchange for old jewelry, where only the price for “upgrading” 

is  paid,  a  buying  method  which  is  commonly  applied  by  Senegalese  women  in  the  jewelry 

market. Both calibration and the example of analogy considerably facilitated and enhanced the 

learning process of the difference method. 

7 

 

Corrigan  and  Rousu  (2006)  state  that  multiple  trials  with  posted  prices  may  influence 

bids and advice to use just one round of bidding or multiple trials without posting prices. In the 

biscuit trials we posted prices to explain the auction mechanism, but during the rice auctions we 

did not reveal any bidding information. We conducted one bidding round before and one round 

after the taste treatment. 

After  the  individual  bidding  rounds,  we  kindly  asked  the  subjects  to  gather  around  a 

round table and attempt to achieve a consensus on their difference in collective WTP (CWTP) 

for  each  alternative  rice  type.  We  left  the  subjects  alone  during  the  discussion  to  avoid 

influencing.  Not  surprisingly  perhaps  in  the  African  context  of  female  social  networking,  the 

group discussions were very lively and democratic as they involved most subjects. We observed 

a certain degree of dominance by elder women and traders, who were more acquainted with 

market prices. Our post-experimental survey revealed that only 4% of the participants did not 

agree with the proposed CWTP estimates. 

At the end of the session, analogously to Roosen et al. (1998), we randomly selected 

one  product  and  one  bidding  round  as  binding.  We  explicitly  explained  this  during  our 

introduction to avoid the substitution effect that could arise if participants could win more than 

one product which could compromise bidding their true value for the products. 

Results 

Table  1  shows  the  socio-demographic  characteristics  and  questionnaire  responses  of  the 

sample. We invited 10 times 10 women to participate in our sessions, of which five were held in 

the  morning  and  five  were  in  the  afternoon.  One  of  the  women  participated  twice  so  we 

canceled the results of her second participation and obtained a dataset of 99 participants. The 

average age was 37, 80% were unemployed and the majority went to primary school or had not 

8 

 

followed any formal education.3 A consequence of the low education level is the high rate of 

illiteracy which we had to take into account. The average monthly income was around 150,000 

FCFA  (290$)  and  the  average  family  size  was  10  individuals  with  a  minimum  of  two  and  a 

maximum of 30. One fifth of the women had a cooking housemaid and the average time spent 

on dinner preparation, including going to the market, preparation and actual cooking, was more 

than four hours. We also asked if they were aware of local quality SRV rice, which was the case 

for  more  than  80%  of  the  women.  This  is  in  line  with  the  results  from  Fall  et  al.  (2007)  who 

observed that the recognition of local rice is quite high in the areas close to production zones 

like Saint-Louis. We expect a much lower awareness rate remote from the production zones, 

e.g. in the capital Dakar. 

 

Table 2 presents some descriptive statistics for the bids. Four observations can be made 

about  these  bids.  First,  the  WTP  for  local  unlabeled  and  labeled  quality  rice  is  significantly 

higher than the WTP for imported rice. The participants are willing to pay about 80% more to 

exchange their endowed rice in local quality rice than in imported rice. This can be due to quality 

differences; the imported rice still contains impurities while the local quality rice is almost free 

from  impurities  and  ready  for  boiling.  As  the  experiment  has  been  conducted  in a  production 

zone,  participants  have  a  higher  connection  with  local  rice  than  in  remote  zones  where  we 

expect a higher preference for imported rice (Fall et al. 2007).  

 

Secondly, against our expectations, our data did not support any evidence of a labeling 

effect. The participants judge the rice on its intrinsic quality attributes and not on extrinsic cues 

                                                     
 

 

3 The education level of our group is consistent with the survey of Fall and Diagne (2008).

such as region-of-origin labels. This may suggest that urban African women in production zones 

are closely connected to the market and the product due to daily bargaining over food prices in 

relation to quality.  

 

A third remarkable observation is the negative influence of the taste treatment. The WTP 

to  exchange  the  benchmark  rice  drops  with  20  to  30%  after  the  taste  treatment  for  all  of the 

three  alternatives.  The  benchmark  rice  is  the  raw  form  commonly  supplied  on  the  market, 

contains a high level of impurities and consists in a mix of broken, intermediate and long-grain 

rice. Eaten without any supplements, this rice can taste better because of its mixed composition. 

Moreover, as this rice type needs to be purified before cooking, it was less discounted in cooked 

form than in non-cooked form. In addition, we observe that the difference between labeled and 

unlabeled rice does not change. Tasting does not influence their point of view towards a label. 

Lastly,  we  observe  a  strong  difference  of  WTP  in  the  morning  and  the  afternoon;  the 

WTP  drops  with  more  than  50%  and  the  percentage  of  zero  bids  doubles.  Hoffman  (1993) 

rejected the hypothesis that bids are constant during the day and this is also reflected in our 

results. For most participants the morning sessions entailed an interruption in their daily routine 

of going to the market and preparing céébu jën (rice with fish) for lunch, which is invariably the 

single most important meal of the day in Senegal (Fall et al. 2007). Some of them still having 

rice purchases in mind, these women may value rice more than women who just had their lunch 

and completed all daily rice purchases in the morning. 

To identify the factors that influenced the bids, we estimate random effects tobit models 

because of the mass of bids located at zero FCFA. Analogously to Lusk et al. (2004) we adjust 

the tobit model to incorporate random effects to account for the panel nature of the data. Each 

participant submitted six bids, i.e. for three different rice types in two bidding rounds. The Tobit 

model, incorporating random effects is

where bidijt is the auction bid for the ith consumer (i = 1, …, 10), in the jth session (j = 1, …, 10), 

for the pth rice type (imported, non-labeled, labeled) in the rth bidding round (r = before or after 

tasting),  which  is  observed  only  at  positive  levels,  xijpr  is  a  vector  of  independent  variables 

including dummy variables identifying rice types, a dummy variable for bidding round, and socio-

demographic variables, uij is an individual specific disturbance for subject i in session j, and vijpr 

is the overall error term. 

 

The first column in table 3 presents the determinants of the individual bids. We observe 

a  significantly  positive  impact  of  morning  sessions  and  a  significantly  negative  impact  of  the 

taste treatment on bids. The results indicate that bids on imported rice were significantly smaller 

than  bids  on  unlabeled  rice  but  there  is  no  statistical  evidence  in  support  of  a  labeling  effect 

(similar  to  table  2).  From  the  socio-demographic  variables,  only  indigenous  significantly 

(negatively) affected the bids. This is consistent with the results of Umberger and Feuz (2004) 

who conclude that demographic variables are poor predictors of bids. 

 

The third column in table 3 reports the determinants of CWTP. As our sample size was 

based on 10 groups and three CWTP values per consensus session, we identified the major 

determinants  through  stepwise  regression.  The  taste  dummy  was  obviously  excluded  as  the 

consensus sessions happened after the taste treatment. Remarkably, in contrast to individual 

bids,  collective  consensus  exhibits  a  significantly  positive  label  effect.  Moreover,  consensus 

groups  with  older  and  more  highly  educated  women  reach  significantly  higher  CWTP  values, 

while groups with more informed people about local rice reach lower CWTP values. 

 

Next, we regress the absolute differences (distances) within sessions between individual 

and collective WTP estimates to the same set of independent variables: 

11 

 

(cid:3627)(cid:1849)(cid:1846)(cid:1842)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)(cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3398)(cid:1829)(cid:1849)(cid:1846)(cid:1842)(cid:3036)(cid:3043)(cid:3627)(cid:3404)(cid:2009)′(cid:1824)(cid:3036)(cid:3037)(cid:3043)(cid:3045)(cid:3397)(cid:1873)(cid:3036)(cid:3037) 

(3) (cid:1829)(cid:1849)(cid:1846)(cid:1842)(cid:3036)(cid:3043) is the collective willingness to pay for product p in session i. The distances may reveal 

useful information about collective decision-making. We may reasonably assume that the lower 

the distance between the individual and the group estimate, the higher the intra-group influence 

of the individual. The results are presented in the second column and are more or less similar to 

the WTP regression presented in the first column, the only difference being that labeling has a 

significantly positive effect on the distance. The latter suggests that region-of-origin labels may 

increase  disagreement  among  women  on  whether  these  extrinsic  cues  guarantee  intrinsic 

quality  or  whether  they  deserve  a  higher  price  due  to  patriotic  or  emotional  involvement 

(Obermiller and Spangenberg 1989). 

 

The results from table 3 warrant an in-depth analysis. Therefore, we adopt an approach 

commonly  used  in  the  psychological  literature  in  which  we  assume  that  group  decision  are 

weighted  sums  of  individual  preferences  and  that  the  individual  weights,  i.e.  the  intra-group 

influence  of  individuals,  is  exponential  in  nature  (Bonner,  Sillito  and  Baumann  2007;  Davis 

1996). First, to eliminate scale biases we standardize the continuous variables to the interval 

[0,1] in two alternative ways by dividing them by the sample maximum and the minimum.4 Next, 

we  take  the  natural  exponential  of  the  continuous  variables  and  leave  the  dummy  variables 

unchanged. We finally predict the CWTPs for each session i (i = 1,…, n = 10) and each product 

p (p = 1,…,3) using each of the alternative socio-demographic variables j (j = 1, …, k = 12): 

                                                     
 

 

4  Dividing  by  the  sample  maximum  diminishes  the  effect  of  the  variables,  dividing  by  the  minimum 

amplifies the effect.

Table 4 reports the correlation between the observed and predicted CWTPs for each variable. 

We also added three alternative predicting weighting schemes commonly used in the literature. 

Equal  weighing  yields  a  correlation  coefficient  of  0.60;  any  variable  producing  a  weighing 

scheme with a correlation higher than this value is superior to ordinary averaging for predicting 

CWTP  values  and  can  be  considered  as  a  determinant  of  collective  decision-making  on  the 

value of alternative rice types. The median is found to be an inferior predictor (0.55), while the 

“best  rule”,  i.e.  the  bid  closest  to  the  CWTP  gets  all  the  weight,  obviously  yields  a  superior 

correlation  (0.73).  Most  of  the  individual  socio-demographic  variables  are  unobservable  or 

quasi-observable (indigenous, higher education, trader, family income) to other participants in 

the  group  sessions.  Age  is  the  only  strongly  observable  variable  and  our  results  show  that  it 

better  predicts  group  response  than  ordinary  averaging.  This  result  is  robust  under  both 

rescaling  scenarios  (0.64-0.67),  implying  that  women  tend  to  rely  on  this  factor  to  attribute 

influence  weights  to  their  peers  in  group  decision-making.  This  provides  useful  preliminary 

information  for  designing  effective  collective  value  chain  and  generic  promotion  strategies 

relying on social capital and networks. 

Conclusion 

This study investigates how Senegalese consumers value quality rice. We used experimental 

auctions with as auction mechanism the Vickrey second price auction to obtain our data. We 

revisited the auction procedures used in developed countries and adapted them to the context 

of  a  developing  country.  The  participants  bid simultaneously  on  three  alternatives  before  and 

after tasting the products with the knowledge they could only purchase one item. As studies on 

13 

 

group  decisions  revealed  that  groups  significantly  outperform  individuals  in  the  estimation  of 

judgmental variables, we included a consensus meeting after the experimental auction stage, 

which yielded more precise estimates of the collective valuation of alternative rice types by ad 

hoc women groups. 

 

Participants, on average, are willing to pay an 80 percent higher price premium, relative 

to imported rice, to exchange their endowed benchmark rice into local quality rice. This indicates 

that  the  local  quality  rice  brand  Rival  is  able  to  compete  against  its  “rival”,  i.e.  imported  rice. 

However, individual bids did not respond significantly to the Rival label. This is in contrast with 

collective  consensus  which  exhibits  a  significantly  positive  label  effect.  These  findings  are 

important for designing labeling and marketing strategies and provide useful information for rice 

traders, retailers and local rice farmers in the Senegal River Valley and national policy makers 

who  are  currently  implementing  an  ambitious  food  self-sufficiency  program.  Labeling  and 

branding significantly and positively affect collective valuation, but not individual valuation. We 

also  observe  a  significant  and  positive  “morning”  effect,  indicating  that  valuation  of  rice  may 

considerably  vary  during  the  day  and  that  it  peaks  during  the  morning  when  women  are 

preparing lunch. Tasting negatively affected individual valuation and did not affect valuation of 

extrinsic  cues  such  as  labeling  and  branding.  Collective  decision-making  on  rice  valuation  is 

largely influenced by age, which provides useful information for designing collective value chain 

and generic promotion strategies through exploiting social capital and networks.
