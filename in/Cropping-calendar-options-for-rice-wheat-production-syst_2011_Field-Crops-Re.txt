The onset of rains during dry to wet transition fallow periods in rice–wheat production systems in Nepal
cause substantial losses of soil nitrogen if the system is improperly managed. To make use of available
nutrients and water, this transition period can either be shortened by early rice planting, or be extended
by late planting, allowing a third crop to be grown. Shifting planting dates would require rice genotypes
adapted to the different environments. Crop duration is inﬂuenced by both vegetative and reproductive
development, which in turn is inﬂuenced by the photo-thermal environment and genotypic responses
to it. An experiment was conducted to derive genotypic photo-thermal constants from phenological
observations on diverse rice cultivars, which were then applied to the concept of the phenological model
RIDEV to design cropping calendar options. Environmental effects on variation of crop duration were
determined by planting at different dates. The risk of yield losses to sterility caused by low temperatures
was estimated by simulation. Thirty-one different genotypes of rice were planted at 8 dates in 15-day
intervals starting 27 April 2004 at the experimental ﬁeld of the Regional Agriculture Research Station,
Lumle, Nepal. The shortest duration to ﬂowering was observed for planting dates in late May and early
June. Simulation of ﬂowering dates with RIDEV yielded correct results only for the early planting dates.
For later planting dates simulated ﬂowering dates showed an increasing deviation from the observed. In
most cultivars, minimum air temperature below 18 ◦C during booting to heading stages caused near-total
spikelet sterility and a speciﬁc delay in ﬂowering. However, the chilling tolerant cultivars Chomrong
and Machhapuchre-3 cultivated at high altitude showed less than 30% spikelet sterility even at 15 ◦C.
Simulating crop durations with the derived thermal constants allowed evaluating the different calendar
options for high altitude systems.

1. Introduction

In Nepal, rice–wheat rotation systems are a major source for
food (Prasad and Donald, 2005). The rice–wheat crop production
system in Nepal includes a Dry-to-Wet Transition (DWT) fallow
period of variable length depending on altitude between the har-
vest of wheat (usually starts from early March) after the cold and
dry winter season and the transplanting of rice (usually starts from
mid June) at the beginning of the monsoon season (Becker et al.,
2007). DWT of 6–8 weeks in the Himalayan mid-hills (altitude
1500–2500 masl) renders nitrogen management difﬁcult due to
frequent changes in the aeration status of the soil caused by early
rain spells (George et al., 1994; Pande and Becker, 2003). To bet-
ter manage nutrient and water availability, the DWT can either
be extended, thus potentially allowing a third crop (e.g. a short
duration legume) to be grown during the DWT, or be shortened

to allow for a rice crop having longer duration and thus, higher
yield potential. Both options require a shift in planting date for the
rice, since the cropping period for wheat as winter crop cannot be
changed. Shifting the planting date in the system requires rice geno-
types adapted to the new growing environment. Crop duration is
determined by plant development, which is known to be inﬂuenced
by the photo-thermal environment (Dingkuhn et al., 1995). Short-
ening the DWT would require genotypes resistant to cold during
the early vegetative phase of development, followed by increased
thermal demand during later development stages to avoid a gap
between maturity and planting of the subsequent wheat crop.

Rice production at high altitude (above 1000 masl) is gener-
ally affected by chilling injury and spikelet sterility (Sthapit et al.,
1997), limiting both the area of production and the length of the
growing season (Sthapit and Shrestha, 1991). Thus, extending the
DWT would require rice genotypes with a short duration, low
thermal requirements for development, and cold tolerance dur-
ing the reproductive stage in order to avoid yield losses due to
cold sterility. In the late 1990s a decision support tool (RIDEV)
was developed, allowing rice farmers to select genotypes based

on their photo-thermal requirements and on the risk of chilling
induced spikelet sterility for speciﬁc cropping calendars in the
Sahelian zone of Africa (Dingkuhn, 1995; Dingkuhn and Miezan,
1995; Dingkuhn et al., 1995). For 96 irrigated rice genotypes, photo-
thermal constants describing genotypic responses to temperature
and photoperiod were derived from sowing date experiments in
the Sahel for use as model parameters.

The scientiﬁc aim of the present study was to study, with the
help of the RIDEV model, the phenology and spikelet sterility
of local and introduced rice genotypes in response to the ther-
mal environments associated with different sowing dates under
irrigated altitude conditions in Nepal. The underlying applied
objective was to develop a methodology to identify appropriate
genotype× planting date combinations for the improved manage-
ment of the DWT and develop cropping calendar options. For the
parameterization of the model, a “mini rice garden” sowing date
experiment was conducted to derive the photo-thermal constants
for a set of 31 rice genotypes.

2. Materials and methods

Experiments were conducted on research ﬁelds at the Regional
Agricultural Research Station, Lumle (28◦18(cid:4) N, 83◦49(cid:4) E, 1740 masl)
of Kaski district in Nepal between April and December 2004. This
location falls within the sub-tropical summer rain zone with cool
dry winters and warm humid summers. The total annual rain-
fall was 6094 mm with most of the rainfall concentrated in the
monsoon season from May to October. The climatic pattern as
recorded for the site in 2004 is shown in Fig. 1. Daily minimum
and maximum temperature and rainfall data were obtained from
the on-site meteorological station. Astronomical day length (pho-
toperiod) from sunrise to sunset was calculated according to Frere
and Popov (1979).

2.1. Genetic materials

Thirty-one rice genotypes (Table 1) were included in the ﬁeld
trials, including eight cultivars (32Xuan-5C, I Kong Pao, IR28,
IR64, IR31785-58-1-2-3-3, IR4630-22-2, ITA306 and Jaya) with
known photothermal constants established under Sahelian condi-
tions (Dingkuhn and Miezan, 1995). Among those IR4630-22-2 and

IR31785-58-1-2-3-3 represent references for photoperiod sensi-
tive and day length neutral responses, respectively. CG14 a short
duration traditional Oryza glaberrima cultivar from Senegal was
also included for its photoperiod sensitivity, WAB 450-24-3-2-P18-
HB represents ﬁrst generation NERICA developed by Africa Rice,
and WAS 30-11-1-4-6-1-1-3 and WAS 30-11-1-4-6-1-2, selected
for high yield potential under Sahelian conditions were included
as cold sensitivity checks. The collection of 31 cultivars was com-
pleted by 4 long, 11 medium and 4 short duration cultivars (Table 1)
from Nepal adapted to different altitudinal agro-ecosystems.
Those comprised the japonica types Chaite-1 and Chaite-4, short
duration spring rice, adapted to sub-tropical environments and
widely cultivated in the southern low-land warm plains (Terai)
of Nepal, Khumal-11 and Chainung-242, medium duration tem-
perate japonica types commonly grown in the mid hills and the
temperate japonica types Chomrong and Machhapuchre-3, long
duration and cold tolerant adapted to the high altitude rice sys-
tems. The local indica types comprised short duration spring rice
(Chaite-6 and Hardinath-1) and medium duration rainy season
rice (Makawanpur-1, Sabitri, Masuli) cultivated in the Terai and
foot hills. Makwanpur-1 was included in the trial for its resistance
to gall midge; Sabitri was included for its resistance to blast and
Masuli for its ﬁne grain and straw quality. In addition, 6 indica
types adapted to the cool temperate mid hill environment were
included, namely Himali, Kanchan, Khumal-2, Khumal-4, Khumal-
6, Khmual-9, and Manjushree-2. Jethobudho (indica) known as
Pokhareli was included as long duration, traditional cold-sensitive
landrace adapted to low root-zone temperatures.

2.2. Mini rice garden

The recommended sowing date for rice at mid hills altitude is
mid June (corresponding to sowing date number 4 in this study).
Thus to allow testing options for earlier and later sowing; 3 ear-
lier sowing dates, predating recommended sowing by a maximum
of 6 weeks and 4 sowing dates delaying sowing by a maximum of
8 weeks were chosen. Therefore, all 31 genotypes were sown in
15-day intervals at eight consecutive dates starting 27 April 2004.
At each sowing date a block including the 31 genotypes (Table 1)
was sown. The design was a non replicated, completely randomized
block design. Seed was pre-soaked for 24 h and kept in a ger-

mination chamber for 48 h. Pre-germinated sprouted seeds were
sown. Ninety seeds of each genotype per planting date were dib-
bled seeded into 45 pockets of equal distance in one square meter
plot size.
The soil was a well drained acidic sandy loam. To all plots fer-
tilizer was applied at a rate of 120:80:60 (N:P:K) kg ha−1 using
urea, diammonium phosphate, and muriate of potasssium as rec-
ommended for the region. Nitrogen was applied as 1 basal dose
(40 kg ha−1) and 2 top dressings of 40 kg ha−1 each at tillering and
ﬂowering stages. P and K were applied as basal dose. Hand weeding
was done as required. Sowing and harvesting were done manually.
Water supply was mainly rainfall with additional irrigation to keep
at least 2 cm of ponded water layer. Pesticides were not used.

Crop ontogeny, characterized by seedling emergence, ﬁrst tiller-
ing, panicle initiation, booting, heading, 50% ﬂowering, 100%
ﬂowering, and physiological maturity were visually assessed on
a daily basis on all plots throughout the experimental period. All
observations including yield components were made in each plot
on the 25 central hills. To avoid bias in the determination of spikelet
sterility ratio (SSR), panicles from 10 randomly selected plants out
of the 25 central hills were bulk sampled. Numbers of ﬁlled and
unﬁlled grains were counted and weighted.

2.3. RIDEV model

Based on eight planting dates, photo-thermal constants were
determined for each genotype following the procedure described
by Dingkuhn et al. (1995) and the RIDEVCAL parameter optimiza-
tion procedure (Dingkuhn and Wopereis, unpublished) which is
a ﬁeld-based photo-thermal model for ﬂowering. In the model,
crop duration is considered a function of thermal time measured
in growing degree days. A genotype speciﬁc thermal time needs to
be accumulated to progress from germination to panicle initiation
(Tsum) coinciding with BVP if photoperiod (PP) is inductive. This

thermal time requirement increases if the genotype is photoperiod
sensitive (CPP) and if day length is non-inductive (long) at the time
of the end of the basic vegetative phase (BVP). A short photoperiod
thus accelerates and a long photoperiod delays ﬂowering (Vergara
and Chang, 1985). Rice plants do not respond to photoperiod during
the entire vegetative period from sowing to ﬂowering (Vergara and
Chang, 1985), if the plants are insensitive to photoperiod. Roberts
and Summerﬁeld (1987), divided the vegetative period into three
phases: the pre-inductive, the inductive, and the post-inductive
phase. Plants are sensitive to photoperiod only during the inductive
phase (Yin and Kropff, 1998).

The basic concept of the RIDEV model is the summation of heat
units and a linear thermal response of development rate. Ther-
mal time is calculated on the basis of cardinal temperatures base
temperature (Tbase, lower limit for development) and optimum
temperature (Topt, upper limit). Although only daily min and max
temperatures are used as input, diurnal temperature proﬁles are
estimated by the model, which is necessary because ambient tem-
perature may exceed the Tbase and Topt limits only during part of
the day. Photoperiodism is modeled via a slope constant (CPP) and
a basic vegetative phase (BVP). BVP is the shortest period to ﬂow-
ering across tested environments expressed in days. Photoperiod
and transplanting shock act as modiﬁers of total heat requirement
(Tsum), thereby having greater effects on duration at low than at
high temperatures. All these photo-thermal constants (Tbase, Topt,
Tsum, BVP and CPP) were considered as genotypic and calibrated by
optimization (RIDEVCAL). The model uses air temperature at 2m
as input and transforms it into a physiological temperature (state
variable Tphys), which is the estimated heat (within the Tbase − Topt
interval) sensed by shoot apex, whose position within the canopy
depends on the development stage (submerged until internode
elongation, then moving up and ﬁnally located at top of the canopy
at ﬂowering). Floodwater temperature is calculated with an empir-
ical model considering weather and ground cover as described by

Spikelet sterility due to cold for chilling tolerant genotypes were
considered as 100%, 50% and 0% if mean Tmin from booting to head-
ing are 14, 15 and 20 ◦C, respectively, whereas for other genotypes
16, 18 and 20 ◦C for cold and 42, 37 and 32 ◦C for heat were con-
sidered as in RIDEV. Chomrong (short duration) and IR64 (medium
duration) were selected for the development of cropping calendar
options.

Eq. (1) considers thermal parameters to estimate development
rate (DR), where Tmean is the mean air temperature. Higher devi-
ation in estimated duration to ﬂowering using thermal equation
(1) can be adjusted by incorporating the effect of photoperiod as
in Eq. (2). Eq. (3) is a simpliﬁed photothermal equation to estimate
development rate considering critical photoperiod. In this equa-
tion, Tsum is multiplied by the intercept (CPPA) of the regression for
photoperiodic correction (TsumPPcrit) and the slope (CPPB) was con-
sidered to be the photoperiod slope constant (CPP). For every 1 h
increase in photoperiod, the expression of the Eq. (1) was improved.
Hourly increase in photoperiod was expressed as the difference of
photoperiod during panicle initiation (PPpi) and critical photope-
riod (PPcrit). PPcrit is the photoperiod below which rice genotypes
are insensitive. It is estimated as quadratic polynomial relation
between prediction error (PE) of duration to panicle initiation and
PPpi (Dingkuhn et al., 1995). Eq. (4) estimates development stage
(DS) as a summation of development rate.

Crop duration (where, DS = 1 for ﬂowering) and spikelet steril-
ity (mean Tmin from booting to heading is considered) due to cold
and heat were simulated using MicroSoft Excel 2007 for all 31 geno-

Crop duration varied among cultivars and planting dates. On
average the difference between the longest and shortest duration
to ﬂowering was 28 days, whereas duration to ﬂowering varied
among the eight planting dates between 10 and 55 days for the local
and between 9 and 64 days for the international check varieties. All
international check varieties showed longer durations to ﬂower-
ing in Lumle (Nepal) as compared to Ndiaye (Senegal). On average,
duration to ﬂowering observed in Lumle was increased by factor
1.3 for maximum and factor 1.8 for minimum duration (Table 2).
Duration to ﬂowering was shortest for most of the genotypes when
sown between May 12 and June 11. Cultivars Sabitri, Masuli, Jaya,
and Jethobudho showed the shortest duration to ﬂowering when
sown on April 27. For the cold tolerant cultivars Machhapuchre-
3 and Chomrong, duration to ﬂowering was shortest when sown
between June 11 and July 11.

cultivars Jaya, ITA306, IR4630-22-2, IR31785-58-1-2-3-3, I Kong
Pao, IR28, IR64, 32Xuan5C and Sahel108 were already published
based on the experiments conducted in Sahelian environments
(Dingkuhn and Miezan, 1995). Using those PTC to simulate dura-
tion to ﬂowering for Lumle conditions with the RIDEV model was
not successful. Particularly for the later planting dates RIDEV failed
to simulate the observed durations, due to a large effect of minor
minimum temperature changes on the simulation of heat unit accu-
mulation. Therefore, new PTC were derived from data observed in
the ﬁeld experiment. The optimization program RIDEVCAL using
procedures described by Dingkuhn and Miezan (1995) was used
to optimize base temperature (Tbase), thermal time required to
progress from germination to ﬂowering (Tsum), optimum temper-
ature for the maximum rate of development (Topt), duration of the
basic vegetative phase (BVP), and the photoperiodic slope constant
indicating the increase for Tsum as percentage per hour increase in
daylength (CPP) for the climatic conditions in Lumle. Tbase and Tsum
estimation based on RIDEVCAL were shown in Table 3. For most of
the international check varieties photo thermal constants derived
from the ﬁeld data in Nepal deviated from those established under
Sahelian conditions (e.g. lower Tbase and Topt, higher Tsum). Based on
RIDEVCAL, Tbase ranged from 6 to 13 ◦C with most of the cultivars
showing Tbase between 8 and 9 ◦C. Chomrong and Machhapuchre-
3, recommended for cultivation in the high hills were found to
have the lowest Tbase (6 ◦C). Hardinath-1 recommended for the hot
lower plain areas (Terai) had the highest Tbase (13 ◦C) and the low-
est Tsum (310 ◦C) for ﬂowering at 12 h daylength. Topt ranged from
20 to 26 ◦C. For many cultivars Topt was between 20 and 22 ◦C. CPP
ranged from 0.357 to 27.53 in cultivar Makawanpur-1 and Himali,
respectively.

from sowing to ﬂowering and over-estimated duration to maturity
for some genotypes. However, chilling tolerant cultivars had less
variation in duration to ﬂowering in later planting dates. About 60%
of the simulated crop duration to ﬂowering showed less than 5 days
differences from observed and about 40% showed more than 5 days
differences (Fig. 2). Differences between observed and simulated
duration to ﬂowering increased linearly as a function of mean Tmin
from booting to heading for mean Tmin lower than 17 ◦C (Fig. 3). In
all the planting dates, genotypes were exposed to Tmin below 18 ◦C

ommendations. Therefore, the core concept of the RIDEV model was
adapted to a simpliﬁed simulation using spread sheet calculation
procedures (Microsoft Excel 2007) to predict phenological stages
and spikelet sterility for cropping calendar development.

3.3. Simpliﬁed simulation of photothermal effects on phenology

Development rate can be deﬁned as progress to a singular devel-
opmental event such as ﬂowering, provided that other factors such
as photoperiod sensitivity are absent. If that is the case, and if the
observed thermal variation is small enough to remain within the
range of linear response of plant development, ﬂowering can be
predicted with two genotypic constants Tbase and Tsum. Thereby,
Tbase is the temperature at which progress to ﬂowering is zero and
Tsum is the accrued number of heat units required for ﬂowering,
with the daily heat dose equaling Tmean − Tbase. A linear thermal
effect on development is commonly observed if Tmean does not
exceed the genotypic optimum temperature Topt. We assume that
Topt had only little effect in the present study, since maximum
air temperature in the ﬁeld trials (Fig. 1) rarely exceeded geno-
typic Topt. Thus, Tbase and Tsum can be estimated from the linear
regression of thermal duration to ﬂowering (in terms of accrued ◦C
to the basis of zero) against the accrued number of days (Fig. 4).
The intercept of this relationship thereby provides an estimate of
Tsum (which is assumed to remain constant despite the variation
in absolute time to ﬂowering) and the slope provides an estimate
of Tbase. Furthermore, the degree of linearity of the observed cor-
relation across sowing dates permits to evaluate whether for the

simulated duration) and the mean, minimum daily air temperature actually expe-
rienced by the crop between booting and heading stages, Lumle 2004.

between booting and heading, constituting a major difference to
most of the Sahelian planting dates (Dingkuhn et al., 1995).

As RIDEV was developed in a Sahelian environment, the appli-
cation of the model for cropping calendar development in the high
hills of Nepal would need further validation, as the duration to
ﬂowering and maturity is not sufﬁciently accurate for calendar rec-

shown, the slope (a) represents Tbase (accumulation of heat per day) in ◦C and the intercept (b) signiﬁes Tsum (dd) of BVP without taking photoperiod into consideration. The
number of data points in the graphs corresponds to the number of sowing dates for which ﬂowering occurred.

environments considered, photoperiodism had a signiﬁcant effect
or not.

Tbase and Tsum were estimated by linear regression as described
above for all 31 genotypes. Fig. 4 exemplarily shows the results for
six contrasting genotypes. Derived Tbase and Tsum were entered into
Eqs. (1) and (4) and used to predict ﬂowering as days after sowing
with the simpliﬁed simulation procedure. The simulation yielded
accurate estimations of duration to ﬂowering for the early sow-
ing dates but strongly over-estimated duration to ﬂowering for the
later planting dates (Fig. 5a). A detailed analysis of the amount of
heat units accumulated in the simulation as compared to the Tsum
required for ﬂowering in the later sowing dates showed only minor
differences in Tsum. This was due to minor differences in daily accu-
mulation of heat units due to a slightly over estimated Tbase, easily
within the range of 4–6 ◦C reported by Dingkuhn et al. (1995) and
most probably due to accuracy of the ﬁeld based observations. An
analysis of the simulation error showed substantial over estimation
of days to ﬂowering for the latest planting dates. Stepwise reduction
of Tbase showed that a small decrement of 0.25 ◦C from the derived
Tbase was sufﬁcient to predict ﬂowering for almost all cultivars and
planting dates (Fig. 5b inset) except for three outliers (Fig. 5b). These
corrected thermal parameters Tbase and Tsum (Table 3) were used to
simulate days to ﬂowering for all genotypes for different planting
dates to develop appropriate cropping calendar option.

3.4. Thermal effects on spikelet sterility

High spikelet sterility was observed in late planting dates. Chill-
ing at booting to heading stage (DS 0.85–1.00) is associated with
spikelet sterility (Dingkuhn et al., 1995). The critical minimum
temperature below which spikelets are sterile at this stage was
about 18 ◦C for all except two cultivars, namely Chomrong and
Machhapuchre-3 (Fig. 6). In Lumle, average Tmin between booting
and heading was below 18 ◦C for all planting dates. Spikelet steril-
ity was thus generally high and frequently close to 100%. Chilling
tolerant cultivars Chomrong showed 30% spikelet sterility even at
mean Tmin of 15 ◦C between booting and heading (Fig. 6).

4. Discussion

perature actually observed between booting and heading stages, individually
determined for each cultivar and date in Lumle, 2004. Except for Chomrong and
Machhapuchre-3, other cultivars were broken down into two parts and the rela-
tions were linearly regressed taking Khumal-11 as a reference cultivar due to its
spikelet sterility variation from less than 30% to 100% within the range of less than
14–18 ◦C mean Tmin from booting to heading.

leads to nutrient conservation, increased nutrient use efﬁciency,
and increased sustainability of the system (Pande and Becker,
2003). In the mid hills, transition period is not sufﬁciently long to
grow seasonal crops. Growing transition seasonal crops and/or the
replacement of the dry season wheat crop by a crop, like potato, can
result in a substantial deviation from the recommended planting
dates of rice (Shrestha et al., 2007). The potential option may be
shifting of rice planting dates to earlier for better yield and manage
soil nutrients by incorporating wheat straw for temporary immo-
bilization of soil nitrogen during DWT periods (Becker et al., 2005;
Shrestha et al., 2005) in the mid hills.

the reproductive development, consequently results different crop
durations. The RIDEV model developed at WARDA, Senegal to pre-
dict crop duration using PTC of rice genotypes when applied to
Lumle conditions either over or under estimated the duration of
phenological stages of the local rice genotypes.

The RIDEV model requires PTC of the rice genotypes to be grown
in the system. Establishing PTC from ﬁeld experiments can lead
to difﬁculties predicting the exact crop duration with the RIDEV
model if the thermal and photoperiodic conditions (micro climate)
are not closely monitored and are insufﬁciently variable among
planting dates. Field based studies would either result in wrong
genotypic constants, wrong predictions of crop duration, or both
(Dingkuhn et al., 1995). This approach requires optimization pro-
grams for respective genotypic constants to determine best-ﬁtting
models. For this, a rice garden experiment should be conducted
over a year with different planting dates. To derive PTC more accu-
rately, many successive dates are required (Craufurd et al., 2003)
for better regression output. The RIDEV model assumes that geno-
types have genetically ﬁxed PTC. Extrapolation beyond the period of
the experiment shows possible errors. Determination of PTC under
laboratory conditions is easier than in the ﬁeld condition as tem-
perature and photoperiod varies over time. However, ﬁeld based
studies enable the characterization of large numbers of genotypes
which is not possible in growth chambers (Dingkuhn et al., 1995).
Tbase is usually determined by extrapolation. Under the exper-
imental conditions, phenology studies based exclusively on air
temperature over estimated Tbase by 4–6 ◦C. This bias was great-
est at mid season when the leaf canopy was developed but culms
not yet elongated, and greater in the dry than in the wet season
(Dingkuhn et al., 1995). The effective temperature for develop-
ment in RIDEV is based on the actual temperature at the growing
point, which in paddy rice is located in the ﬂood water for devel-
opment stages up to booting. Thus, for development to ﬂowering,
the largest share of time, the water temperature is more important
than the air temperature. In Lumle, the relationship between daily
air temperature amplitude, ground cover, and water temperature
as established for the RIDEV model may not have been valid due
to the fact that water temperature in the ﬁeld trial was in gen-
eral low (Fig. 7) due to the higher altitude and close proximity
to the Himalaya ice belt range and lower energy input owing to
the lower angle of the sun. Energy needs to heat up water depend
on the speciﬁc heat capacity of water (4.19 kJ kg−1 ◦C). Thus, esti-
mations of ﬂood water temperature need to take into account
the minimum water temperature as a starting point, the water

depth and the potential heat absorption at the current latitude.
Minimum water temperature in Lumle was about 10 ◦C less than
in Ndiaye in Senegal during entire cropping season. Heat energy
required to raise water temperature up to 10 ◦C requires 43 kJ for
1 m2 area of 1 mm (equivalent to 1 kg) water table without any
canopy cover. To increase water temperature up to 10 ◦C of 5 cm
water table for 1 m2 area heat energy required will be 2 MJ, which
is further dissipated to the soil and atmosphere. In Lumle, average
solar radiation during the rice cropping season is 17 MJ m−2 d−1.
This energy is further dissipated due to reﬂection, sensible heat
and latent heat causing insufﬁcient radiation to increase the water
temperature in Lumle. Under the experimental condition, incor-
rect calculation of daily temperature means biased Tbase by about
1–2 ◦C (Dingkuhn et al., 1995). Except for cultivar 32Xuan-5C, Tbase
derived for Lumle (using RIDEVCAL) was lower than under Sahe-
lian conditions. Including an energy balance taking into account
the predominant water temperature, insulation, and the physical
properties of water in combination with whether data and ground-
cover most likely would render RIDEV better suitable to estimate
crop duration in higher altitude cropping systems.

Photoperiod in Senegal

is longer during summer

time
(June–July) and shorter in winter as compared to Nepal (Fig. 7).
Few days in March and September have same hour of photoperiod
in both locations. Dingkuhn and Asch (1999) have assumed PPcrit to
be 11.5 h and photoperiod sensitivity a linear function of photope-
riod above PPcrit. Variation of PPcrit with temperature has been
reported (Roberts and Summerﬁeld, 1987). Genotypic variation in
PPcrit has not been adequately determined. As for temperature, at
least four photoperiod sensitivity levels (insensitive; less, medium
and highly sensitive) would determine the response more accu-
rately due to genotypic variation. Photoperiod-sensitivity among
traditional cultivars is greatest at lower latitudes, decreasing as
latitude increases (Craufurd and Qi, 2001). As in the high hills in
Nepal, temperature had a much stronger effect on crop duration
than any deviation in photoperiod, PP was ignored when simulat-
ing the duration of phenological stages for potential adaptation of
cropping calendars in those systems.

4.2. Cropping calendar options

In the high hills of Nepal, rice is cultivated in the summer wet
season and wheat in the dry season with the residual soil mois-
ture during fall and winter. Both crops receive little irrigation and
depend strongly on rainfall, thus, grain yields in theses areas are

low. The common transplanting time of a month old rice seedling
starts from 15 June. Chomrong (local adapted genotype, short
duration) and IR64 (international check variety, medium duration)
were selected to simulate seasonal patterns of crop duration and
spikelet sterility for several planting dates in Lumle (Fig. 8). Simu-
lations were performed with Microsoft Excel using 36 years (from
1970 to 2005) of weather data. In the adapted model, PP was not
included and critical temperatures for 50% spikelet sterility were
set to 18 and 16 ◦C for IR64 and Chomrong, respectively. Simula-
tions generally resulted in a higher percentage of spikelet sterility
due to chilling in IR64 than in Chomrong. For Chomrong, simula-
tion showed a potentially save period of planting dates between
mid-April and end of July with cold induced spikelet sterility not
exceeding 50% and a total length of crop duration of 135 days
when transplanted before 15 July. This would theoretically allow
for two different options of introducing a third crop into the calen-
dar: either a 90 day duration legume crop at the beginning of the
year between the wheat and the rice or a similar crop of 90 day
duration at the end of the growing period between the rice and the
wheat. The ﬁrst option would require a short duration legume such
as arrow leaf clover or mucuna as green manure whereas the second
option would allow for a cold tolerant grain legume to be grown
with the residual moisture. Both options will need to be tested
within the system for their effects on nutrient and water avail-
ability as well as for their economic viability. In addition, a third
option would allow increasing the duration of rice in the system
by early transplanting of long duration rice such as Jethoburo. Such
a genotype would require a high Tsum, a well developed chilling
and drought tolerance during the early vegetative stage as well as
some degree of cold tolerance at the early generative stage to avoid
yield loses due to spikelet sterility. Such early sown long duration
rice would take full advantage of the mineralization peak induced
by the early rains (Pande and Becker, 2003) and would decrease
erosion losses induced by the long fallow period.

5. Conclusions

We have shown that applying a non-modiﬁed version of RIDEV
for the development of cropping calendar option in the rice–wheat
system in the high hills in Nepal was not possible due to an overem-

phasis on photoperiod, an insufﬁciently sensitive Tbase simulation
and an inaccurate simulation of water temperature and, thus, the
effective temperature at the meristem. Nonetheless, applying the
principles on which RIDEV is based in a simpliﬁed simulation
allowed to accurately simulate the duration of phenological stages
of local rice varieties as well as the level of chilling induced spikelet
sterility for variable planting dates in Lumle. Locally adapted cul-
tivars with high chilling tolerance exist (e.g. Chomrong), allowing
shifting of planting dates for rice for additional options of including
a third crop in the calendar. Future research efforts are needed to
evaluate and validate the proposed options for their effects on the
cropping system with regard to soil fertility, water availability and
economic viability.
