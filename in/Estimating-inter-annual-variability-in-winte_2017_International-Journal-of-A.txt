Crop   simulation   models   are   commonly   used   to  forecast   the   performance   of   cropping   systems   under   dif-
ferent   hypotheses   of   change.   Their   use   on   a  regional   scale   is  generally   constrained,   however,   by   a   lack
of   information   on  the   spatial   and   temporal   variability   of   environment-related   input   variables   (e.g.,   soil)
and   agricultural   practices   (e.g.,   sowing   dates)   that   inﬂuence   crop   yields.   Satellite   remote   sensing   data
can   shed   light   on   such   variability   by   providing   timely   information   on   crop   dynamics   and   conditions   over
large   areas.   This   paper   proposes   a  method   for   analyzing   time   series   of   MODIS   satellite   data   in   order   to
estimate   the  inter-annual   variability   of   winter   wheat   sowing   dates.   A   rule-based   method   was  developed
to  automatically   identify   a  reliable   sample   of  winter   wheat   ﬁeld   time   series,   and   to   infer   the  correspond-
ing   sowing   dates.   The   method   was   designed   for   a  case   study   in   the  Camargue   region   (France),   where
winter   wheat   is  characterized   by   vernalization,   as  in   other   temperate   regions.   The   detection   criteria
were   chosen   on   the   grounds   of   agronomic   expertise   and   by   analyzing   high-conﬁdence   time-series   veg-
etation  index   proﬁles   for   winter   wheat.   This   automatic   method   identiﬁed   the   target   crop   on   more   than
56%   (four-year   average)   of   the   cultivated   areas,   with   low   commission   errors   (11%).   It  also   captured   the

Extending   the  analysis   to  the   years   2002–2012   showed   that  sowing   in   the   Camargue   was   usually   done

local   agro-climatic   drivers   showed   that   the   type   of   preceding   crop   and  the   weather   conditions   during
the   summer   season   before   the   wheat   sowing   had  a  prominent   role   in   inﬂuencing   winter   wheat   sowing
dates.

1.  Introduction

The  management  of  agricultural  systems  in  European  regions
varies  considerably  in  space  and  time  due  to  differences  in  envi-
ronmental  conditions  (e.g.,  pedo-climatic  conditions),  available
technologies  (e.g.,  crop  varieties),  agricultural  policies  (e.g.  subsi-
dies,  environmental  regulations),  and  market  prices  (Bakker  et  al.,
2005;  Dury  et  al.,  2012;  Pettorelli  et  al.,  2005).  Monitoring  and
understanding  the  diversity  and  dynamics  of  agricultural  systems
on  a  regional  scale  is  crucial  to  support  their  evolution  towards  a
more  sustainable  future  (Zheng  et  al.,  2012).

Various  tools  and  approaches  can  be  adopted  to  monitor  agri-
cultural  systems  and  support  their  adaptation  (Basso  et  al.,  2013),

including  crop  simulation  models,  which  are  commonly  used  to
understand  the  current  performance  of  cropping  systems,  and  to
predict  future  trends  under  different  hypotheses  of  change  (Soltani
et  al.,  2016).  These  hypotheses  may   relate  to:  (1)  the  development
and  adoption  of  new  crop  varieties  more  resistant  to  diseases  or
thermal  stresses,  or  hybrids,  for  instance  (Bregaglio  and  Donatelli,
2015;  Webber  et  al.,  2016);  (2)  new  cropping  systems,  such  as  direct
seeding,  intercropping,  or  agroforestry  (Khaledian  et  al.,  2009;  Miao
et  al.,  2016;  van  der  Werf  et  al.,  2007);  and  (3)  the  impact  of  climate
change  on  cropping  systems,  and  consequent  adaptation  strategies,
such  as  changing  the  sowing  dates  (Holzkämper  et  al.,  2015;  Nendel
et  al.,  2014).

When  simulating  the  future  of  cropping  systems,  particularly  on
a  regional  scale,  a  key  issue  concerns  the  availability  of  appropriate
information  on  crucial  crop  cultivation  variables  to  be  provided  as
input  in  crop  models  (Moulin  et  al.,  1998;  Therond  et  al.,  2011;
Yuping  et  al.,  2008).  Retrieving  details  on  crop  management  is

often  challenging  (Clavel  et  al.,  2011;  Jiang  et  al.,  2014)  because
they  vary  considerably  within  and  between  regions,  and  year  by
year  (Therond  et  al.,  2011;  Vyas  et  al.,  2013;  Yuping  et  al.,  2008).
Among  the  possible  sources  of  information,  censuses  conducted  by
governmental  agencies  or  regional  institutions  provide  aggregated
data  that  may   not  be  detailed  enough  for  crop  modelling  purposes
(Grassini  et  al.,  2015).  Data  coming  from  interviews  with  farmers
are  more  complete,  but  limited  in  number  and  related  to  a  given
year,  so  they  are  not  always  sufﬁciently  representative  of  the  spatial
and  temporal  diversity  of  a  region  (Chen  et  al.,  2002).  The  sow-
ing  date  is  an  essential  information  to  the  accuracy  of  simulations
obtained  with  crop  models  (Folberth  et  al.,  2012;  Van  Wart  et  al.,
2015).  For  most  crops,  the  sowing  date  is  crucial  to  explain  crop  per-
formance  variables,  such  as  yield  (Delmotte  et  al.,  2011;  Kogan  et  al.,
2013).  Sowing  date  variability  can  span  several  months  for  some
plant  species,  depending  on  the  inter-annual  climate  variability  in
the  region  and  on  local  agricultural  practices.

In  this  setting,  analyzing  long-term  time  series  of  satellite
images  is  an  efﬁcient  way  to  elucidate  inter-  and  intra-annual  sow-
ing  date  variability  (Bradley  et  al.,  2007;  Guyet  and  Nicolas,  2015).
Earth  Observation  satellite  data  archives  can  be  used  to  estimate
this  variable  as  they  provide  regular  and  synoptic  information  on
crop  characteristics  (Justice  et  al.,  2002;  Kumar  and  Monteith,  1981;
Rembold  et  al.,  2013).  In  particular,  time  series  of  spectral  vegeta-
tion  indexes  (VIs),  such  as  the  Enhanced  Vegetation  Index  (EVI)
(Huete  et  al.,  2002),  can  be  used  to  characterize  vegetation  dynam-
ics  and  retrieve  information  on  key  phenological  stages  by  various
means,  such  as  thresholding,  curve  ﬁtting,  derivatives’  analysis,  etc.
(Curnel  and  Oger,  2007).  This  approach  was  ﬁrst  used  to  moni-
tor  natural  ecosystems  and  is  often  termed  land  surface  phenology
(LSP)  (Ganguly  et  al.,  2010).

Many  studies  have  focused  on  estimating  the  timing  of  crop
phenological  stages  like  emergence,  ﬂowering  or  senescence,  for
example  (e.g.  Sakamoto  et  al.,  2005;  Boschetti  et  al.,  2009;  Manfron
et  al.,  2012;  Pan  et  al.,  2015).  In  agricultural  applications,  a  fur-
ther  and  more  challenging  step  is  to  use  the  same  approach  to
investigte  more  speciﬁc  information  about  farming  practices.  For
instance,  agricultural  ﬂooding  and  the  duration  of  rice  paddy  ﬂood-
ing  were  investigated  by  Sakamoto  et  al.  (2007)  and  by  Ranghetti
et  al.  (2016),  while  crop  management  practices  such  as  forage  cut-
ting  were  examined  by  Halabuk  et  al.  (2015).

As  claimed  by  (Jin  et  al.  (2016)  it  is  generally  accepted  that  this  is
virtually  impossible  to  detect  sowing  dates  on  the  basis  of  remote
sensing  data  alone  as  there  is  a  period  after  crop  sowing  and  before
crop  emergence  in  which  the  crop  cannot  be  detected  with  remote
sensing.  Sowing  dates  must  therefore  be  inferred  from  satellite  data
on  the  basis  of  crop-  and  region-speciﬁc  assumptions.  Successful
applications  can  be  found  for  rice  sown/transplanted  in  ﬂooded
ﬁelds  because  the  presence  of  the  water  prior  to  any  vegetative
growth  can  be  detected  on  satellite  images  (Sakamoto  et  al.,  2005;
Boschetti  et  al.,  2015b).

For  other  crops,  previous  studies  often  focused  on  identifying
the  so-called  “green-up”  date  (i.e.,  coinciding  with  the  earliest  reli-
able  evidence  of  vegetation  on  satellite  images),  from  which  sowing
dates  could  be  inferred  using  various  methods.  In  an  application  for
monitoring  wheat  in  northern  India,  Lobell  et  al.  (2013)  assumed
that  green-up  coincided  with  crop  emergence  and  calculated  sow-
ing  dates  by  going  back  a  ﬁxed  time  (three  weeks)  from  this  date.
Green-up  was  established  as  the  point  where  the  curve  ﬁtted  to
the  VIs  reached  10%  of  its  maximum  amplitude  for  the  year  in
question.  A  similar  approach  was  taken  by  Vyas  et  al.  (2013)  in
the  same  geographical  area,  exploiting  daily  normalized  difference
VI  (NDVI)  produced  by  the  Indian  geostationary  satellite  INSAT  3A
CCD.  Green-up  was  identiﬁed  using  a  threshold  method  and  the
sowing  date  was  set  at  7  days  prior  to  green-up.  These  methods
proved  efﬁcient  for  the  subtropical  areas  of  northern  India,  where

wheat  is  sown  between  October  and  November,  then  undergoes  a
rapid,  monotonic  increase  in  biomass  up  to  the  ﬂowering  phase,
and  the  total  growing  period  lasts  from  100  to  170  days.

In  temperate  climates,  winter  wheat  is  sown  in  autumn  and
takes  from  180  to  300  days  to  mature  (Asseng  et  al.,  2012).  After
emerging,  winter  wheat  undergoes  a  tillering  stage,  then  requires
a  period  of  cold  for  up  to  90  days  (until  the  end  of  winter),  dur-
ing  which  it  remains  dormant.  This  is  followed  by  a  rapid  stem
elongation  and  subsequent  plant  growth.  Hence  the  “double  hump”
pattern  observed  in  winter  wheat  time  series  by  Pan  et  al.  (2012)
and  by  Chu  et  al.  (2016),  makes  it  rather  difﬁcult  to  use  the  previ-
ously  mentioned  solutions  based  on  identifying  green-up  and  then
backtracking  a  ﬁxed  number  of  days  to  estimate  the  sowing  date.
The  green-up  typically  detectable  from  coarse-resolution  satellite
data  relates  to  the  post-dormancy  vegetative  phase,  and  the  dura-
tion  of  the  dormancy  period  varies  both  spatially  and  temporally,
depending  on  crop  variety,  for  instance,  and  winter  weather  con-
ditions.

Jin  et  al.  (2016)  analyzed  winter  wheat  in  Shanxi  province
(China),  based  on  images  with  a  30  m  resolution  acquired  every  two
days  by  the  HJ-1  a/b  multispectral  sensor.  They  could  identify  two
green-up  times,  one  after  sowing  (before  dormancy),  and  another
more  robust  one  preceding  the  head  development  phase.  They  were
thus  able  to  estimate  winter  wheat  sowing  dates  by  applying  the
relation  proposed  by  Lobell  et  al.  (2013)  to  the  ﬁrst  green-up  iden-
tiﬁed.  This  was  made  possible  by  their  use  of  data  with  a  very  high
spatial  and  temporal  resolution.  Such  data  are  not  readily  avail-
able  worldwide  and  none  dating  back  long  enough  for  use  it  in
medium-  to  long-term  analyses.  The  feasibility  of  reliably  detecting
the  weaker  green-up  preceding  dormancy  is  however  not  demon-
strated,  particularly  when  moderate-resolution  satellite  data  are
used.

Employing  the  same  satellite  data,  Pan  et  al.  (2015)  used  met-
rics  derived  from  NDVI  signals  to  map   the  phenological  stages  of
winter  and  summer  crops  in  China.  These  authors  estimated  only
the  green-up  after  dormancy  for  winter  wheat,  without  retrieving
sowing  dates.

Based  on  this  literature  review,  we  decided  to  develop  a  spe-
ciﬁc  algorithm  to  estimate  winter  wheat  sowing  dates  in  temperate
climates  from  moderate-resolution  satellite  data.  The  study  was
conducted  in  the  Camargue  region  (France).  Durum  wheat  sowing
conditions  vary  greatly  in  this  region,  inﬂuenced  by  environmental
conditions,  agricultural  practices  and  subsidies,  and  sowing  may
take  place  in  appropriate  conditions  over  a  time  frame  of  about  ten
weeks  (Mouret  J.C.,  pers.  comm.,  Dec.  5,  2015).  No  data  are  currently
available  on  the  local  intra-  and  inter-annual  variability  of  win-
ter  wheat  sowing  dates,  but  this  variability  needs  to  be  analyzed,
and  the  factors  inﬂuencing  the  timing  of  this  operation  need  to  be
clariﬁed  in  order  to  improve  the  crop  models  used  to  character-
ize  the  present  conditions  and  simulate  future  scenarios  (including
e.g.,  climate  change).  In  this  context,  the  aims  of  the  present  study
are  twofold:  (1)  developing  an  approach  based  on  remote  sensing
capable  of  identifying  a  robust  sample  of  areas  where  winter  wheat
is  grown  from  MODIS  time  series  with  a  250  m  spatial  resolution,
and  estimating  the  corresponding  sowing  dates;  (2)  analyzing  the
inter-annual  variability  of  winter  wheat  sowing  dates  in  the  Camar-
gue  over  the  years  2002–2012  in  relation  to  meteorological  and
anthropic  drivers.

2.  Materials  and  methods

The  study  involved  three  main  phases  to  develop,  apply  and
validate  the  proposed  method  (Fig.  1).  MODIS  data  were  ﬁrst
preprocessed  and  representative  temporal  crop  signatures  were
extracted  by  exploiting  reference  information  (Sections  2.2.1  and

2.2.2).  A  rule-based  algorithm  for  detecting  a  robust  sample  of  areas
where  winter  wheat  is  grown,  and  identifying  the  corresponding
sowing  dates  was  developed,  applied  to  the  years  2002–2012  (Sec-
tion  2.2.3)  and  validated  (Section  2.3).  The  inter-annual  variability
of  the  sowing  dates  thus  estimated  was  then  analyzed  in  relation
to  meteorological  data  and  main  farming  practices  (Section  2.4).

2.1.  Study  area

The  Camargue  is  a  region  in  south-eastern  France,  at  the
mouth  of  the  Rhône  River.  The  Natural  Regional  Park  of  Camar-
gue  (PNRC:  Parc  Naturel  Régional  de  Camargue  in  French)   is  a
protected  area  covering  about  108,000  ha  and  including  almost
all  the  land  between  the  two  branches  of  the  Rhône  (Grande
Camargue),  plus  some  areas  further  east  and  west  (Fig.  2).  Based
on  the  PNRC  land  use  maps,  which  also  provide  in  vector  for-
mat   information  on  individual  crops  on  a  scale  of  1:5000  (http://
www.pnrpaca.org/,  last  accessed  September  2016),  the  areas  being
cultivated  in  2006  and  2011  accounted  for  33%  and  29%  of  the
park’s  surface,  respectively  (Fig.  2A  and  Fig.  2B).  The  two   main
crops  are:  rice  (Oryza  sativa  L.),  covering  36%  (11,684  ha)  and
56%  (16,037  ha)  of  the  area  under  cultivation  in  2006  and  2011,
respectively;  and  winter  wheat  (Triticum  durum  L.),  occupying  22%
(7350  ha),  and  10%  (2927  ha)  of  the  cultivated  area  in  2006  and
2011,  respectively.  The  average  size  of  the  winter  wheat  ﬁelds

was  2.73  ha  (min  =  0.21  ha;  max   =  30.26  ha;  median  =  2.26  ha)  in
2006,  and  2.83  ha  (min  =  0.38  ha;  max   =  23.69  ha;  median  =  2.31  ha)
in  2011.

While  rice  is  sown  within  a  narrow  time  frame  (usually  from
the  end  of  April  to  the  middle  of  May),  the  winter  wheat  sowing
dates  span  a  longer  period,  from  late  September  to  early  December.
The  timing  depends  largely  on  climatic  and  anthropic  factors:  it
rains  more  frequently  in  autumn,  and  this  can  delay  sowing;  and
winter  wheat  is  usually  less  remunerable  than  rice  in  terms  of  mar-
ket  price  and/or  common  agricultural  policy  (CAP)  subsidies,  so
farmers  tend  to  give  priority  to  their  rice  farming  schedule  (e.g.,
postponing  their  wheat  sowing  if  they  need  to  delay  harvesting
their  rice  crop)  (Mouret  J.C.,  pers.  comm.,  Dec.  5,  2015).

an  area  of  5.37  ha)  and  sinusoidal  projection  (Didan,  2015)  were
used  to  identify  winter  wheat  growing  areas  and  to  estimate  when
they  were  sown.  These  products  are  based  on  a  maximum  value

retrieves  the  best  observation  obtained  during  the  compositing

period  (Solano  et  al.,  2010).  They  are  provided  with  an  eight-day
nominal  time  shift  between  TERRA  and  AQUA,  and  combining
them  enables  VI  time  series  to  be  constructed  with  a  nominal
eight-day  temporal  frequency.  In  particular,  a  time  series  of  484
MODIS  MOD/MYD  13Q1  images  covering  the  period  2002–2013,
from  DOY  177  in  2002  (end  of  June)  to  DOY  361  in  2013  (end
of  December)  was  downloaded  for  pre-processing  from  the  NASA
Land  Processes  Distributed  Active  Archive  Center  (LP  DAAC)  at
the  USGS  Earth  Resources  Observation  and  Science  (EROS)  Cen-
ter  (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/),  using  the  MODIStsp  package  (Busetto
and  Ranghetti,  2016)  of  the  R  software  (R  Core  Team,  2016).  The  pro-
posed  approach  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  MODIS  EVI  time  series
(Eq.  (1)).

The  EVI  was  chosen  for  its  well-known  suitability  for  monitor-
ing  vegetation  dynamics  (e.g.,  Dubovyk  et  al.,  2015;  Sakamoto  et  al.,
2007,  2005;  Son  et  al.,  2013).  Information  on  EVI  were  extracted
from  the  MOD/MYD  13Q1  product  and  stacked  to  create  a  multi-
temporal  array.  Information  was  also  obtained  on  EVI  quality  ﬂags,
reﬂectance  in  the  blue  band,  the  DOY  of  acquisition,  and  pixel
−
quality.  A  weighted  Savitzky-Golay  smoothing  ﬁlter  (SAV-GOL 
Savitzky  and  Golay,  1964)  was  then  applied  to  the  EVI  time  series
to  remove  residual  noise  from  the  data  (Pettorelli  et  al.,  2005).  The
SAV-GOL  ﬁlter  has  been  widely  used  for  smoothing  time  series  of
MODIS-derived  VIs  (Boschetti  et  al.,  2015a,  2015b;  Chen  et  al.,  2004;
Geng  et  al.,  2014;  Manfron  et  al.,  2012;  Ren  et  al.,  2008;  White  et  al.,
2009).

2.2.2.  EVI  temporal  crop  signature  extraction

The  available  PNRC  land  use  maps  were  used  to  identify  winter
wheat  ﬁelds  in  the  MODIS  250  m  pixels  covering  the  study  area.
Geographic  Information  System  (GIS)  analyses  were  run  to  extract
polygons  corresponding  to  agricultural  areas,  and  then  calculate
the  fractions  covered  by  speciﬁc  crops  in  each  MODIS  pixel  for  the
years  2006  and  2011.  MODIS  pixels  with  at  least  80%  of  their  sur-
face  covered  by  a  particular  crop  (rice,  winter  wheat,  etc.)  were
considered  homogeneous.  These  were  used  to  calculate  statistical
descriptors  (median  and  standard  deviation)  for  each  date  in  the
EVI  time  series,  and  thus  obtain  representative  temporal  signatures
for  the  various  crops.  Our  aim  was  to  identify  the  more  important
descriptors  for  the  purpose  of  distinguishing  winter  wheat  from
the  other  crops,  and  estimating  when  it  was  sown.

shows  median  values  (red  line)  and  the  interquartile  range  (red  shadow)  for  479
winter  wheat  time  series  in  2006  and  2011,  considering  MODIS  pixels  with  a  frac-
tional  cover  exceeding  80%.  (For  interpretation  of  the  references  to  colour  in  this
ﬁgure  legend,  the  reader  is  referred  to  the  web  version  of  this  article.)

A  preliminary  analysis  (see  Supplementary  Material  S1)  showed
that  the  small  green-up  identiﬁed  by  Jin  et  al.  (2016)  using  high-
resolution  data,  which  coincided  with  the  emergence-tillering
period  (a  few  weeks  after  sowing),  could  not  be  pointed  reliably  on
the  MODIS  time  series.  The  green-up  automatically  identiﬁed  on
the  strength  of  a  10%  increase  in  the  EVI  signal  (Lobell  et  al.,  2013;
Vyas  et  al.,  2013;  Dong  et  al.,  2016)  was   mainly  related  to  the  faster
growth  of  the  vegetation  after  dormancy,  in  spring  (see  Supplemen-
tary  material  S1).  It  is  therefore  not  easy  to  compute  the  sowing
date  by  going  back  a  given  number  of  days  from  the  green-up  date
because  the  duration  of  the  dormancy  period  depends  largely  on
winter  temperatures  (vernalization  requires  a  certain  number  of
chilling  days).  We   thus  developed  and  tested  a  rule-based  approach
for  estimating  sowing  dates  that  can  cope  with:  i)  the  peculiarity  of
the  winter  wheat  signal  in  temperate  areas  (long  interval  between
sowing  and  green-up);  and  ii)  the  speciﬁc  characteristics  of  the
case  study  area  (fragmented  agricultural  environment)  in  relation
to  moderate-resolution  satellite  data.

2.2.3.  Algorithm  development  and  implementation

On  the  basis  of  expert  agronomic  knowledge,  a  set  of  rules  for
automatically  detecting  winter  wheat  growing  areas  and  estimat-
ing  sowing  dates  was  obtained  by  analyzing  the  crop’s  temporal
signatures  (Fig.  3  and  Supplementary  Material  S2).  The  main  fea-
tures  of  the  phenological  cycle  of  winter  wheat  in  the  Camargue
can  be  summarized  as  follows:

194 

G.  Manfron  et  al.  /  International  Journal  of  Applied  Earth  Observation  and  Geoinformation  57  (2017)  190–201

is 

• the  seeding  period 
in  Autumn  (late  September  to  early
December),  followed  by  crop  emergence  after  6-10  days;
• the  plant  reaches  the  three-leaf  stage  after  a  vegetative  period  of
2–3  weeks,  then  the  tillering  period  begins,  with  a  long  ensuing
period  of  dormancy  in  winter  (December-February,  ending  when
the  need  for  chilling  has  been  met);
• the  tillering  phase  is  completed  at  the  end  of  the  winter,  and
followed  by  a  green-up  phase  (February–March),  during  which
the  plant  rapidly  increases  in  biomass  and  leaf  area;
• the  crop  heading  period,  when  plants  reach  their  maximum  Leaf
Area  Index,  and  the  subsequent  reproductive  phase  take  place
between  April  and  May;
• grain  ﬁlling  and  ripening,  leading  to  the  plant’s  drying  and  senes-
cence,  generally  occur  in  late  June.

The  detection  of  some  of  these  distinctive  features  in  EVI  time
series  (Fig.  3)  enables  winter  wheat  to  be  distinguished  from  other
crops  (Huang  and  Lu,  2009;  Lu  et  al.,  2013;  Pan  et  al.,  2012)  (see
Supplementary  Material  S2).  The  most  signiﬁcant  features  for  this
purpose  are  crop  heading  in  late  spring,  and  the  duration  of  the  crop
cycle.  In  fact,  heading  generally  occurs  in  May   for  winter  wheat,  and
in  July  (nearly  two  months  later)  for  summer  crops.  Winter  wheat
−
also  has  a  much  longer  growing  cycle 
  lasting  up  to  8  months,  from
−
autumn  to  late  spring 
  than  summer  crops  (though  it  is  shorter
than  for  perennial  crops  like  alfalfa).  Bare-soil  conditions  due  to
ploughing  in  late  September  to  early  October  were  also  judged  to
be  an  important  feature  to  consider  in  estimating  the  sowing  date.
The  above-mentioned  features  were  formalized  in  rules  and
implemented  in  an  algorithm  to  automatically  generate,  from
MODIS  time  series,  raster  maps  of  winter  wheat  ﬁelds  and  sowing
dates.

It  is  widely  accepted  in  the  literature  that  speciﬁc  local  min-
ima   (MIN)  and  maxima  (MAX)  points  in  a  time  series  respectively
indicate  the  start  of  active  crop  growth  (Pan  et  al.,  2015;  Sakamoto
et  al.,  2005)  and  of  the  crop  heading  period  (Atzberger  and  Rembold,
2013;  Curnel  and  Oger,  2007).  A  pixel  was  thus  recognized  as  win-
ter  wheat  if  its  time  series  featured  a  MAX   point  (crop  heading)  in
the  second  quarter  of  the  year  associated  with  a  MIN   point  preced-
ing  the  MAX   within  a  time  window  compliant  with  the  length  of  a
winter  wheat  crop  cycle.

In  particular,  a  MAX   point  was  assumed  to  correspond  to  crop

heading  if  the  following  requirements  were  simultaneously  met:

1.  crop  calendar:  the  MAX   occurs  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  year

(early  April  to  late  June);

2.  rapid  growth:  the  MAX   is  preceded  by  a  rapid  EVI  growth  typi-
cal  of  the  vegetative  phase  (February–March),  identiﬁable  from
the  presence  of  at  least  three  positive  derivatives  in  a  temporal
window  of  40  days  (5  composites)  before  the  MAX;

3.  senescence:  the  MAX   is  followed  by  a  relatively  fast  EVI  decrease
typical  of  the  senescence  phase,  and  identiﬁable  from  the  pres-
ence  of  at  least  three  negative  derivatives  in  a  temporal  window
of  40  days  (5  composites)  after  the  MAX,  associated  with  a  drop
of  at  least  33%  in  the  EVI  vis-à-vis  the  MAX   value;

4.  high  biomass:  the  EVI  of  the  MAX   is  greater  than  0.42  (see  Sup-

plementary  Material  S4).

A  MIN   point  was  assumed  to  correspond  to  the  wheat  sowing
period  (Pan  et  al.,  2015)  because  it  is  characterized  by  ﬁeld  prepara-
tion,  i.e.  bare  soil  conditions  (ploughing)  indicated  by  a  low  EVI,  and
crop  growth  after  sowing  corresponding  to  a  moderate  increase  in
EVI.  The  identiﬁcation  of  a  suitable  MIN   was  based  on  the  following
conditions:

1.  crop  calendar:  the  MIN   point  occurs  in  a  temporal  window  at

least  three  months  before  the  crop  heading  date  identiﬁed;

2.  bare  soil  conditions:  the  MIN   has  an  EVI  lower  than  0.3,  indicative

of  bare  soil  conditions  (Vyas  et  al.,  2013);

3.  subsequent  crop  growth:  the  MIN   is  followed  by  the  presence
of  at  least  three  positive  derivatives  in  a  temporal  window  of
40  days  (5  composites).

If  a  suitable  MIN   is  identiﬁed,  the  pixel  analyzed  is  then  assumed

to  correspond  to  winter  wheat.

Additional  rules  were  used  to  estimate  the  sowing  date  near  the
MIN   identiﬁed  as  outlined  above.  The  procedure  involved  ﬁnding
the  most  likely  sowing  date  within  a  time  window  ranging  between
September  30th  (the  date  that  agronomists  consider  the  earliest
possible  sowing  date  in  the  study  area)  and  140  days  before  the
estimated  crop  heading  (MAX),  140  days  being  considered  by  the
experts  the  shortest  possible  interval  between  sowing  and  heading
for  winter  wheat  (Mouret  J.C.,  pers.  comm.,  Dec.  5,  2015).

All  the  MIN   points  falling  within  this  period  are  checked  accord-
ing  to  a  “ﬂatness”  criterion.  Previous  experiments  (data  not  shown)
showed  that  “false”  sowing  dates  were  identiﬁed  in  line  with  ran-
dom  minima  points  generated  as  a  result  of  residual  noise  in  the
smoothed  EVI  time  series  obtained  for  periods  containing  several
consecutive  low  EVI  values.  The  ﬂatness  criterion  is  formalized  by
checking  the  4  EVI  values  centered  on  the  local  MIN   points  within
the  sowing  dates  search  window.  A  MIN   point  surrounded  by  EVI
values  of  similar  magnitude  (±5%)  is  identiﬁed  as  noise  and  dis-
carded.  Once  these  points  have  been  detected  and  discarded,  the
earliest  MIN   point  retained  is  considered  the  ﬁnal  estimate  of  the
sowing  date.

The  above-described  rule-based  algorithm  (implemented  in
IDL-Interactive  Data  Language  v8.3)  was   applied  to  the  MODIS  time
series  for  the  years  2002–2012  to  generate  annual  maps  of  wheat
growing  areas  and  associated  sowing  dates.

2.3.  Validation

The  results  obtained  with  the  algorithm  (years  2002–2012)  were
validated  by  comparing:  (1)  the  winter  wheat  raster  maps  obtained
for  2003,  2006,  2009  and  2012  with  Landsat  data;  and  (2)  the  sow-
ing  dates  estimated  in  2010,  2011,  2012  with  ground  reference
data.

2.3.1.  Landsat  validation  of  winter  wheat  growing  areas

The  MODIS-derived  winter  wheat  growing  areas  were  validated
against  independent  reference  data  obtained  from  a  visual  inter-
pretation  of  Landsat  satellite  images  for  the  years  2003,  2006,
2009  and  2012.  The  visual  interpretation  of  high-resolution  satellite
images  is  a  widely  accepted  practice  in  remote  sensing,  especially
when  in  situ  data  suitable  for  building  reference  datasets  are  lack-
ing.  The  method  is  particularly  useful  when  applied  to  large  areas
(from  regional  to  continental),  where  collecting  data  on  the  ground
becomes  too  expensive  (Stroppiana  et  al.,  2015;  Chen  et  al.,  2002;
Sun  et  al.,  2012;  Wulder  and  Franklin,  2012;  Zhao  et  al.,  2014).

A  set  of  Landsat-7  ETM+  images  (spatial  resolution  of  30  m)   was
therefore  used  to  build  an  independent  reference  dataset  for  valida-
tion  purposes.  Judging  from  the  land  cover  information  provided  by
the  PNRC,  winter  wheat  is  the  only  winter  crop  grown  in  the  study
area,  so  Landsat  images  were  selected  in  the  most  suitable  periods
for  distinguishing  it  from  summer  crops.  Two   Landsat  images  were
selected  for  the  years  2003,  2006,  2009  and  2012,  one  obtained
around  mid-April  (when  winter  wheat  is  nearing  its  seasonal  head-
ing  and  summer  crops  are  only  just  starting  to  grow),  and  the  other
in  the  second  half  of  July  (when  winter  wheat  is  harvested  and
summer  crops  are  in  the  heading  phase)  (Table  1).

Then  300  MODIS  pixels  were  randomly  chosen  in  the  study  area
and  labelled  as  “winter  wheat”  or  “other  crops”  based  on  the  visual
interpretation  of  the  Landsat  images.  Where  fragmented  condi-
tions  were  detected  by  Landsat  at  MODIS  pixel  level,  the  pixel  was
skipped.  The  random  selection  of  MODIS  pixels  was   then  repeated
recursively,  for  the  four  years  considered  for  validation  purposes
(2003,  2006,  2009,  and  2012),  if  fewer  than  50  MODIS  pixels  were
labelled  as  winter  wheat.  The  ﬁnal  database  of  1200  labelled  MODIS
pixels  was  used  as  the  reference  data  set  for  assessing  winter  wheat
detection  performance  using  standard  validation  accuracy  met-
rics  calculated  from  error  matrices  (Congalton,  1991;  Brivio  et  al.,
2006):  overall  accuracy  (OA),  class  omission  and  commission  errors
(OE,  CE),  and  Cohen’s  kappa  coefﬁcient  (K)  (Cohen,  1960).

2.3.2.  Ground  reference  validation  of  sowing  dates

The  reliability  of  the  sowing  dates  estimated  from  the  MODIS
data  was  assessed  by  comparison  with  ﬁeld  information  on  agro-
nomic  practices.  The  available  ﬁeld  survey  data  included  ﬁeld-scale
winter  wheat  sowing  dates  for  three  different  farms,  which
accounted  for  a  total  of  1334  ha,  corresponding  to  4.6%  of  the  area
under  cultivation  in  2011  according  to  the  PNRC.  The  information
concerned  83  winter  wheat  ﬁelds  (261  ha)  in  2011,  94  (343  ha)  in
2012,  and  111  (363  ha)  in  2013.

The  information  associated  with  the  different  ﬁelds  was   ﬁrst
aggregated  at  the  spatial  resolution  of  MODIS  by  means  of  a  GIS
spatial  averaging  procedure.  The  averaged  sowing  dates  were  then
associated  with  the  time  of  the  nearest  MODIS  8-day  temporal  com-
posite,  and  a  comparison  was  drawn  between  the  averaged  ﬁeld
data  and  the  MODIS-estimated  sowing  dates  for  the  years  2010,
2011  and  2012.  A  total  of  146  pixels  were  involved  in  this  compar-
ison:  52  for  2010,  30  for  2011  and  64  for  2012.

2.4.  Analysis  of  inter-annual  variability  in  sowing  dates

The  results  obtained  with  the  algorithm  for  the  years  2002–2012
were  analyzed  to:  (1)  describe  the  inter-annual  variability  in  sow-
ing  dates;  and  (2)  link  this  variability  with  the  main  drivers
inﬂuencing  farmers’  sowing  practices,  i.e.  weather  conditions  (rain-
fall,  temperature)  and  preceding  crops.

For  the  ﬁrst  point,  two  analyses  were  performed  to  investigate
the  diversity/similarity  in  the  distribution  of  the  winter  wheat  sow-
ing  dates  obtained  for  the  various  years.  First,  the  non-parametric
Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test  (Young,  1977)  was  applied  to  each  pair
of  years  considered  in  order  to  highlight  the  years  exhibiting  sig-
niﬁcantly  different  distributions.  Then  a  more  qualitative  analysis
was  conducted  to  compare  the  relative  earliness  and  skewness  of
the  cumulative  annual  sowing  dates  (see  Supplementary  Material
S3).

Regarding  the  second  point,  our  analyses  were  based  on  daily
measurements  obtained  by  the  weather  station  at  Fourques  from
2002  to  2012.  The  inter-annual  variability  in  the  estimated  sowing
dates  was  analyzed  ﬁrst  in  relation  to  rainfall  patterns,  then  in  rela-

tion  to  temperatures  recorded  during  the  preceding  crop’s  growth
season.  For  this  latter  analysis,  the  preceding  crop  was  identiﬁed
as  wheat  (adopting  the  algorithm  described  here),  or  rice,  which  is
the  only  summer  crop  to  precede  wheat  in  the  study  area.  The  rice
ﬁelds  were  identiﬁed  by  applying  the  PhenoRice  algorithm  on  the
MODIS  time  series  (Boschetti  et  al.,  2015a;  Manfron  et  al.,  2012).

Finally,  a  signiﬁcant  relationship  was   sought  between  varia-
tions  in  the  weather  conditions  during  the  rice-growing  season
and  variations  in  the  winter  wheat  sowing  dates.  This  was   done
by  characterizing  the  temperatures  recorded  during  rice  growth
by  cumulating  the  mean  daily  temperatures  (from  May,  1st  to
September,  30th)  for  each  year,  then  ﬁtting  linear  regression  mod-
els  between  the  cumulative  temperatures  and  the  different  deciles
of  the  distributions  of  the  MODIS-estimated  sowing  dates  for  the
year  concerned.  The  signiﬁcance  of  the  explanatory  variable  (the
cumulative  mean  temperature)  was   assessed  with  Student’s  statis-
tical  tests.  Regression  analyses  were  run  separately  for  each  decile,
and  for  areas  characterized  by  different  preceding  crops,  i.e.  win-
ter  wheat  preceded  by  winter  wheat  (Wheat->  Wheat),  or  winter
wheat  preceded  by  rice  (Rice-  >  Wheat).

3.  Results

3.1.  Accuracy  of  winter  wheat  ﬁeld  identiﬁcation  and  sowing
dates

The  outcome  of  our  validation  process  concerning  the  detection
of  areas  where  winter  wheat  was  grown  is  shown  in  Table  2,  in  the
form  of  error  matrices  for  the  years  2003,  2006,  2009  and  2012,  and
for  all  four  years  together.  The  results  were  good,  with  annual  OA
values  ranging  between  84%  (2006)  and  93%  (2009),  and  Cohen’s  K
coefﬁcient  in  the  range  of  0.54  (2006)  to  0.76  (2009).  Concerning
the  winter  wheat  class,  the  commission  error  ranged  between  3%
and  19%  (mean  11%),  and  the  omission  error  between  28%  and  56%
(mean  44%);  this  means  that,  on  average,  the  method  can  identify
56%  of  winter  wheat  ﬁelds,  with  quite  low  misclassiﬁcation  rates.
Fig.  4  shows  a  comparison  between  the  MODIS-derived  sowing
dates  and  information  provided  by  farmers:  66%  of  the  esti-
±
mates  fell  within 
  16  days  of  the  true  sowing  dates,  and  46%
±
within 
  8  days  (Fig.  4A  and  B).  The  errors  were  centered  on  zero
(Fig.  4B  and  C).  Fig.  4C  shows  the  distribution  of  the  residual  errors
as  a  function  of  the  true  sowing  date.  Predictions  were  more  likely
to  be  too  early  for  late  sowing  dates  (e.g.  from  November  25th  to
December  19th),  and  too  late  for  early  sowings  (from  October  16th
to  24th).  Overall,  the  method  estimated  the  sowing  dates  with  a
mean  absolute  error  of  16.5  days,  and  a  root  mean  square  error  of
22.05  days.

3.2.  Analysis  of  inter-annual  variability

The  analysis  conducted  on  the  years  2002–2012  showed  that,  on
average,  winter  wheat  was   sown  on  November  1st,  with  50%  of  the
estimated  sowing  dates  falling  within  a  25-day  interval  between
October  16th  and  November  9th  (see  Supplementary  material  S2).
Year-to-year  comparisons  drawn  with  the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test  revealed  signiﬁcantly  different  distributions  of  winter  wheat
estimated  sowing  date  (at  p  =  0.05)  for  almost  all  years,  the  excep-
tions  (distributions  were  not  signiﬁcantly  different)  being  the  pairs
2002–2009,  2002–2011,  2006–2009,  and  2009–2012  (Fig.  5,  and
Table  S3.2  in  Supplementary  material  S3).  Qualitative  analyses
using  logit  curves  showed  that  sowing  was   done  earlier  in  2003,
2005  and  2008,  and  later  in  2007  and  2012,  and  also  that  the  sow-
ing  period  was   more  concentrated  in  the  middle  of  the  possible
time  window  (late  September  to  early  December)  in  2004,  2008
and  2011  (See  Table  S3.3  and  Fig.  S3.1).

3.3.  Relationship  between  inter-annual  sowing  date  variability
and  external  factors

3.3.1.  Inﬂuence  of  rainfall  distribution

Fig.  5  also  presents  the  estimated  winter  wheat  sowing  dates
in  relation  to  the  distribution  of  rainfall  events  in  the  Camargue
for  the  years  2002–2012.  In  some  seasons  (e.g.  2004,  2006,  and
2012),  most  of  the  rain  fell  before  the  main  sowing  periods,  while
in  others  (e.g.  2007,  2008  and  2011),  much  of  the  rainfall  occurred
after  sowing,  and  in  2003  the  rainfall  was  evenly  distributed  before
and  after  the  estimated  sowing  period.  There  was   no  evidence  of
any  correlation  between  the  estimated  sowing  dates  and  the  inter-
annual  variability  in  rainfall  events.

3.3.2.  Inﬂuence  of  preceding  crop  and  temperature

Fig.  6  shows  the  average  distribution  of  the  estimated  sowing
dates  grouped  by  the  type  of  crop  preceding  the  winter  wheat.
Clearly,  the  Wheat->  Wheat  areas  tended  to  be  sown  earlier  than
the  Rice->  Wheat  areas  (Fig.  6).  Sowing  between  September  30th
and  October  16th  was  done  less  frequently  (-16%  the  sum  of  sow-

ings  in  the  period)  in  Rice->  Wheat  ﬁelds  than  in  Wheat->  Wheat
ﬁelds,  whereas  late  sowing  (e.g.  November  9th  to  25th)  was  more
common  in  Rice->  Wheat  areas  (+16%  the  sum  of  sowings  in  the
period).

A  signiﬁcant  relationship  emerged  between  the  ﬁrst  deciles
of  the  sowing  date  distributions  in  Rice->  Wheat  ﬁelds  and  the
temperature  during  the  preceding  rice  growing  season.  In  partic-
ular,  the  earliest  40%  of  the  wheat  sowing  dates  in  Rice->  Wheat
ﬁelds  showed  a  signiﬁcant  negative  correlation  with  the  cumu-
lative  temperatures  during  the  rice  growing  season  (p  <  0.01;  R2
−
ranging  between  0.6  and  0.9  depending  on  the  decile 
  Table  3).
In  other  words,  wheat  was   sown  earlier  in  Rice->Wheat  ﬁelds  in
warmer  years,  when  the  rice  was   harvested  earlier.  The  effect  of
temperature  on  wheat  sowing  dates  in  Rice->  Wheat  ﬁelds  was  no
longer  signiﬁcant,  however,  beyond  the  5th  decile  (p  >  0.05)  of  the
distribution.

In  Wheat->  Wheat  areas,  the  effect  of  summer  temperatures  on
winter  wheat  sowing  dates  was   never  signiﬁcant  (p  >  0.05;  Table  3).

4.  Discussion

4.1.  The  method’s  performance

The  method  developed  for  this  study  was  able  to  identify  winter
wheat  ﬁelds  with  overall  omission  and  commission  errors  of  44%
and  11%,  respectively.  This  means  that,  although  not  all  the  win-
ter  wheat  ﬁelds  were  identiﬁed,  the  areas  detected  by  our  method
have  a  very  high  likelihood  of  being  accurate.  Since  the  aim  of  the
method  is  to  automatically  identify  a  reliable  and  representative
sample  of  winter  wheat  ﬁelds,  the  automatic  detection  of  56%  of
the  target  area  with  a  low  probability  of  commission  errors  is  more
than  adequate  for  this  purpose.

Our  validation  of  the  estimated  sowing  dates  showed  that  the
method  detected  the  sowing  date  variability  with  a  margin  of  error
of  8  days  in  46%  of  cases,  and  16  days  in  66%  of  cases.  Bearing  in
mind  that  sowing  dates  in  the  Camargue  can  span  a  period  of  more
than  ten  weeks,  our  method  provided  useful  information  for  the
purpose  of  analyzing  inter-annual  variability  in  crop  management
practices  over  the  course  of  a  decade.

4.2.  Sowing  date  variability  and  consequences  for  crop  modelling

Our  analysis  identiﬁed  a  marked  inter-annual  variability  in  win-
ter  wheat  sowing  dates,  with  two  main  sowing  seasons,  one  in  early
October  (as  in  2003,  2005  and  2008),  the  other  in  late  October  (as
in  2007  and  2012).  Rainfall  patterns  did  not  appear  to  inﬂuence  the
sowing  dates  in  the  Camargue,  though  some  authors  have  reported
such  a  relationship  in  other  Mediterranean  areas  (e.g.,  Bassu  et  al.,
2009).

The  winter  wheat  sowing  dates  did  instead  correlate  with  the
preceding  crop  (rice  vs.  wheat)  and  the  summer  temperatures.  With
climate  change,  weather-related  constraints  may   play  a  fundamen-
tal  role  in  changing  agricultural  practices,  strongly  inﬂuencing  the
growth  cycles  of  crops  such  as  rice  (Bregaglio  et  al.,  2016).  Other
sources  of  variability  may   affect  winter  wheat  sowing  dates  includ-

ing  type  of  soil,  differences  in  soil  moisture  and  ﬁeld  accessibility,
as  well  as  organizational  constraints  at  farm  level  (e.g.  Mailly  et  al.,
2013;  Schaller  et  al.,  2012),  grain  prices  and  CAP  subsidies.

Our  method’s  ability  to  provide  information  on  winter  wheat
sowing  dates  (hitherto  unavailable  for  the  study  area  considered
here)  and  on  their  inter-annual  variability  marks  a  step  forward  in
the  characterization  of  spatially  explicit  and  yearly  variable  crop
calendars.  Such  information  may   be  crucial  for  yield  forecasting,
for  instance,  because  durum  wheat  sowing  dates  strongly  inﬂuence
the  ﬁnal  grain  yield  (Bassu  et  al.,  2009;  Ferrise  et  al.,  2010).  It  can
have  positive  implications  for  the  performance  of  crop  models  too,
because  sowing  date  parameters  strongly  inﬂuence  the  simulation
of  leaf  appearance  dynamics  (Bassu  et  al.,  2009;  Ferrise  et  al.,  2010)
and  nitrogen  uptake  (Ehdaie  and  Waines,  2001).

4.3.  Method’s  exportability,  limits  and  future  prospects

The  proposed  method  relies  mainly  on  expert-derived  rules
and  thresholds.  While,  in  the  speciﬁc  context  considered  here,  the
choices  made  were  the  only  feasible  options  to  ensure  the  robust-
ness  of  our  data,  they  might  limit  the  exportability  of  our  method
to  other  areas.  The  temporal  signature  of  winter  wheat  on  MODIS
images  may   differ,  for  example,  in  the  presence  of  different  crop
species  (e.g.  Triticum  durum  vs  Triticum  aestivum),  with  different
dormancy  and  vegetative  periods,  or  due  to  snow  cover  in  win-
ter.  It  is  worth  noting,  however,  that  the  method  could  easily  be
replicated  for  other  areas  because:  (i)  MODIS  data  are  available
worldwide;  and  (ii)  local  experts  can  adapt  the  agronomic-based
rules  to  their  own  settings.  A  source  of  uncertainty  in  the  results
obtained  with  our  model  stems  from  the  rather  coarse  resolution  of
MODIS  data  in  relation  to  the  dimensions  of  the  ﬁelds  (the  MODIS
pixel  area  of  5.37  ha  is  almost  twice  the  size  of  a  typical  wheat  ﬁeld
in  the  Camargue,  which  is  2.73–2.83  ha),  and  to  the  fragmentation
of  the  landscape  (the  ﬁelds  have  irregular  shapes,  and  wheat  ﬁelds
are  often  interspersed  with  ﬁelds  with  other  crops).  This  leads  to
the  well-known  “low  resolution  bias”  and  “mixed-pixel”  effects,
which  introduce  noise  in  time  series  of  moderate-resolution  satel-
lite  images  (Boschetti  et  al.,  2004;  Mingwei  et  al.,  2008;  Pan  et  al.,
2015;  Sakamoto  et  al.,  2005),  making  it  more  difﬁcult  to  identify
reliable  time  series  for  the  crops  of  interest.  Another  source  of

G.  Manfron  et  al.  /  International  Journal  of  Applied  Earth  Observation  and  Geoinformation  57  (2017)  190–201

uncertainty  derives  from  the  effect  of  the  bi-directional  reﬂectance
distribution  function  (BRDF),  which  can  be  pronounced  for  wide-
angle  sensors  like  MODIS,  further  adding  to  the  noise  in  time-series
data  (Hansen  and  Loveland,  2012;  Huete  et  al.,  2002;  Sakamoto
et  al.,  2010).

For  the  purpose  of  analyzing  long-term  past  dynamics  of  crop
practices,  the  spatial  and  temporal  resolution  of  archival  data  could
be  enhanced  by  combining  heterogeneous  satellite  data  (e.g.  from
MODIS  and  Landsat)  using  “data  fusion”  techniques  to  simulate
time  series  with  a  higher  spatio-temporal  resolution  (Bisquert  et  al.,
2015;  Dong  et  al.,  2016).  An  interesting  opportunity  for  present  and
future  analyses  could  also  come  from  examining  improved  multi-
sensor  time  series  obtained  from  datasets  with  a  higher  spatial
resolution,  by  making  a  combined  use  of  Landsat  8  and  Sentinel-2
data,  for  instance.

5.  Conclusions

In  this  study,  expert  agronomic  knowledge  was  combined  with
an  analysis  of  the  temporal  signatures  of  crops  on  MODIS  satellite
images  to  design  a  method  for  estimating  the  inter-annual  vari-
ability  of  winter  wheat  sowing  dates.  To  our  knowledge,  no  studies
have  yet  focused  on  deriving  winter  wheat  sowing  dates  from  the
analysis  of  moderate-resolution  satellite  data.

MODIS  spatial  and  temporal  resolutions  proved  adequate  for
depicting  inter-annual  winter  wheat  sowing  date  variability,  pro-
information  previously  unavailable  for  the  study  area
viding 
considered,  thus  representing  a  step  forward  vis-à-vis  currently
available  static  crop  calendars.  Our  ﬁndings  revealed  a  marked  vari-
ability  in  sowing  date  distributions  from  one  year  to  the  other,  with
differences  in  the  timing  and  range  of  the  sowing  period.  They  also
showed  that  sowing  dates  in  ﬁelds  where  wheat  was  sown  after
rice  correlated  strongly  with  summer  temperatures  (i.e.,  winter
wheat  sowing  could  be  delayed  by  late  rice  harvests).  Identify-
ing  the  seasonal  distribution  of  sowing  dates  can  also  be  useful  for
assessing  regional-scale  winter  wheat  yield  variability  by  means  of
crop  modelling.  While  our  proposed  method  is  suitable  for  depict-
ing  variability  over  large  areas,  satellite  time  series  with  higher
spatial  and  temporal  resolutions  would  be  needed  for  more  detailed
analyses  on  crop  management  practices.  A  better  spatial  resolution
would  reduce  the  noise  in  time  series  due  to  mixed  pixel  con-
tamination,  while  improving  the  temporal  resolution,  would  reveal
further  characteristics  of  winter  wheat  time  signatures  that  could
be  associated  with  the  crop’s  phenological  features.
