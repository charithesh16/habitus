In some areas of rural Africa, long-standing cultural traditions and beliefs may discourage parents from ver-
bally engaging with their young children. This study assessed the effectiveness of a parenting program
designed to encourage verbal engagement between caregivers and infants in Wolof-speaking villages in rural
Senegal. Caregivers (
443) and their 4- to 31-month-old children were observed at baseline in 2013 and
 
 
 
 
 1 year later at follow-up. Results showed that caregivers in program villages nearly doubled the amount of
child-directed speech during a play session compared to baseline, whereas caregivers in matched comparison
villages showed no change. After 1 year, children in program villages produced more utterances, and showed
greater improvement in vocabulary and other language outcomes compared to children in comparison vil-
lages.

Effect estimates represent a comparison of the marginal means of the comparison group
to either low or high level of participation in the RPP program. Participants categorized in the high participation subgroup include
those who reported attending more than half of the classes and receiving seven or more home visits. Participants categorized in the
low participation subgroup include all other participants in the RPP villages. bDifference in the program subgroup effect estimates (high
minus low participation). cEffects are covariate adjusted for the lagged dependent variables plus characteristics of the child (age, change
in age, age squared, gender, length for age
score, estimated birth size, baseline language milestones score), caregiver (age, relation to
child, education, literacy, attended earlier Tostan CEP, children under 5 years in her care, lost a child, depressive symptoms), household
(polygynous head of household, members who attended earlier Tostan CEP, mean age, median years of education in French or French–
Arabic schools, children under 5 years, crowding, and wealth), and village (population, number of households, midwives, and mar-
abouts; has health clinic, primary school, and day care; time to travel to market and to get drinking water; access to electricity, number
