ABSTRACT 
The information on sowing dates of crop is an important 
step  for  the  forecast  of  the  crop  yield.  Remotely  sensed 
data can be a valuable tool when crop models are applied 
in a GIS environment for simulating regional behavior of 
crop.  An  attempt  has  been  made  in  the  present  study  to 
derive sowing information using satellite-based imageries. 
LISS-III  (Linear  Imaging  Self-Scanning)  imageries  of 
Indian  Remote  sensing  Satellite 
(IRS)  containing 
information  on  Agriculture-farm  of  GBPUA&T, 
Pantnagar,  India,  have  been  acquired  for  the  period  of 
1996-97  to  1999-2000.  A  spectral  profile  of  active 
vegetative  growth  stage  of  wheat  was  generated  and 
regressed  with  DAS  (days  after  sowing).  A  Normalized 
Difference  Vegetation  Index  (NDVI)  based  model  was 
developed for estimating sowing dates of wheat. The data 
of  24  plots  were  used  for  obtaining  coefficients  for 
exponential based model, while performance of the model 
was tested for independent 12 plots. Analysis showed that 
model  could  estimate  sowing  date  with  a  minimum 
difference of 1 day and maximum difference of 24 days 
with an average deviation of 8 days. The Standard Error 
of the Estimate was 9.22 for the estimates made after an 
average of 78 DAS for the all plots, while it was 10.24 in 
the calibration period and 6.42 in the prediction period.

1. Introduction 
Remote  Sensing 
the  science  of  acquiring  and 
interpreting  information  about  the  earth’s  environment 
from  measurements  made  without  physical  contact  with 
the  object  being  studied  [1].  The  vegetation  indices  are 
specific  combinations  of  spectral  responses  in  different 
wavelength  bands,  which  emphasize  a  particular  feature 
of the vegetation. The vegetation indices are quantitative 
measurements indicating the vigor of vegetation [2]. They 
show better sensitivity than individual spectral bands for 
the  detection  of  biomass  [3].  The  application  of  remote 
sensing for crop identification and crop yields assessment 
is  being  done  for  quite  long  time.  In  last  two  decades

remote  sensing 

some  efforts  have  been  made  to  link  space  borne 
information  with  process  oriented  dynamic  crop 
simulation  model.  Moran  et  al.  [4]  evaluated 
the 
application  of 
in  precision  crop 
management  and  recommended  that  future  work  should 
be  focused  on  assimilating  remotely  sensed  information 
into  existing  decision  support  systems  (DSS).  Barnes  et 
al.  [5]  has  listed  three  major  applications  of  remotely 
sensed  data  for  crop  models:  a)  Aid  in  the  definition  of 
zones  that  require  simulation  as  independent  areas;  b) 
Provide  validation  data  on  crop  development,  canopy 
density, and evapotranspiration; and c) Serve as a direct 
input  to  the  model.  There  are  several  options  for 
integration  of  remotely  sensed  data  and  crop  model 
predictions, which include: a) Direct comparison of model 
predictions and remotely sensed estimates [6]; b) Iterative 
adjustment  of  the  crop  model's  genetic  parameters  and 
initial conditions by comparing the model's predictions to 
remotely sensed estimates of ET and LAI [7]; c) Forcing 
the  crop  model's  predictions  to  match  remotely  sensed 
estimates  of  actual  field  conditions  [8];  and  d)  Using 
radiative transfer models so that satellite reflectance data 
can  be  directly  compared  to  a  crop  model's  predictions 
[9].  
The  large  area  (regional)  crop  yield  estimation  requires 
integration  of 
in  GIS 
(Geographical Information System) environment [10, 11, 
& 12]. The major limitation of this procedure is the large 
amount  of  information  needed  on  crop  distribution  and 
management practices. Efforts have been made in the past 
to  account  for  the  spatial  variability  in  crop  by  using 
remote  sensing  data.  The  most  efforts  were  focused  on 
iterative  adjustment  of 
the  crop  models  genetic 
parameters  and  initial  conditions  that  affect  leaf  growth 
and senescence so that simulated LAI matches estimates 
of LAI determined with remotely sensed observations of 
crop canopy reflectance [13].   
The major spatial variability in crop at any given time is 
mainly due to the varying time of sowing. Thus, iterative 
adjustment  of  crop  model  parameters  and 
initial 
conditions, some time miss the important information of 
sowing  and  lead  to  wrong  estimates  of  crop  yield.  The 
information  on  sowing  can  be  generated  using  remote 

simulation  model 

crop 

sensing data by fitting a spectral profile of crop across the 
growing  season,  which  requires  a  number  of  satellite 
images at frequent time interval. The use of satellite based 
data  for  generating  sowing  information  is  restricted  not 
only  by  the  frequent  obstacle  by  cloud,  haze  etc,  which 
hinder  /break  the  continuity  of  spectral  data  but  also 
satellite  data  involve  huge  cost.  In  present  study  we 
demonstrate  the  use  of  minimal  set  of  remotely  sensed 
data for generating sowing information on regional scale.  
 
2. Material and Methods 
Farm Management Data 
Agricultural-farm  of  Govind  Ballabh  Pant  University  of 
Agricultural  and  Technology  (GBPUA&T),  Pantnagar, 
US  Nagar  is  one  of  the  biggest  Agriculture-farm  under 
single  management  in  India.  The  farm  contains  big 
agricultural  fields  where  all  agricultural  operations  are 
fully  mechanized  and  is  ideal  for  remote  sensing  based 
studies.  Block-L  and  Block-C  (Seed  Production  Centre) 
of  Agriculture  farm  were  considered  for  study  and  data 
were acquired for the period 1996-97 to 1999-00.  
Satellite Observations 
Indian  Remote  Sensing  (IRS)  satellite’s  LISS-III  sensor 
data  for  the  study  area  was  procured  from  National 
Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad for the crop 
seasons

To calculate NDVI all images were geo-referenced using 
second  order  polynomial  warping  and  cubic  convulsion 
(cc)  re-sampling 
techniques.  The  farm  fields  were 
identified  on  the  geocoded  FCC  image  with  the  help  of 
farm map having field boundaries and major geographical 
features  of  study  area.  The  raw  pixel  value  or  digital 
number was converted to radiance (Rad) value using the 
following transformation: 
 
Rad 
where, 
Rad is radiance in mW cm-2 µm-1 sr-1 
Gmax is maximum gray value at saturation radiance 
Lmax is saturation radiance of the detector mW cm-2 µm-1 
sr-1 
Lmin is minimum radiance of the detector mW cm-2 µm-1 
sr-1 
 
The  signal  being  received  by  satellite  sensor  is  the 
mixture  of  electromagnetic  radiation  reflected  by  object 
and  by  atmosphere.  It  is  assumed  that  deep-water  body 
absorbs almost all radiation falling on it. So the amount of 
radiation received in all band by satellite sensor on deep-
water  body  is  supposed  to  be  due  to  atmospheric 
scattering.  The  radiance  values  of  each  band  on  water 
body  were  subtracted  from  original  radiance  values  of 
each pixel. 
As images of two different sensors were used, sensor to 
senor  calibration  for  each  band  was  applied  using 
coefficient given by Jaishankar et al. (2001) [15].

Model development 
The  NDVI  values  of  initial  49  agricultural  fields  were 
plotted  against  the  DAS  and  second  order  polynomial 
equation  was  fitted.  The  Figure  1  showed  that  satellite 
images taken in the month of March (the hollow circular 
points)  force  the  curve  to  go  down  in  the  later  part  as 
green biomass which is responsible for higher NDVI, start

wheat  get  matured  almost  at  same  time  irrespective  to

these  values  are  very  near  to  February  months)  months

Figure 1. Cure fitting in NDVI values. The hollow circles represent the NDVI values of March month and were omit-
ted from the study while only rectangular squares (represent active growth period of wheat) were considered. Straight 

vertical line shows that there was no NDVI value available until 30 days of the crop age.  

Crop age (days)

 
The NDVI values of 13 plots (being satellite observations 
taken in March month) were excluded from the analysis. 
The data of 24 plots were used for the model development 
and model performance was verified on the independent 
dataset  of  12  plots.  There  is  no  representation  of  early 
growth  stages  of  wheat  (about  30  days  after  sowing), 
which  causes  flattening  of  logarithmic  curves,  so  the 
NDVI  values  were  regressed  with  reduced  crop  age 
(actual crop age – 30 days). Also the NDVI generated in 
early crop growth stage may lead to wrong estimate as in 
early growth stage the contribution of soil reflectance in 
total  reflected  radiation  is  more  [17].  This  step  could 
explain  the  variation  in  NDVI  due  to  varying  date  of 
sowing more accurately (coefficient of determination: R2 
increases  from  0.73  to  0.80),  hence  the  performance  of 
model is bettered (Figure 2). The logarithmic relationship 
between NDVI and crop age (less 30 days) was: 
NDVI = 0.242 * Ln(X - 30) - 0.1909                    ……..[5] 
                                                 R2 = 0.7961   
Where X is DAS (days after sowing or crop age) 

The  logarithmic  relationship  was  used  to  develop  a 
exponential model to predict the crop age on the basis of 
NDVI 
DAS = Exp(3.2898 * NDVI + 1.3959) + 30          .........[6] 
In  the  equation  (6)  30  has  been  added  because  30  days 
were  set  off  from  the  analysis  due  to  unavailability  of 
data. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
In  the  present  approach  the  age  of  wheat  crop  was 
estimated  using  the  NDVI  values  derived  from  satellite 
data  and  then  crop  age  was  backtracked  to  find  out  the 
sowing time of wheat. The NDVI values could very well 
represent the variability in the crop due the difference in 
age at the time of satellite pass as it varied from 0.295 to 
0.878  with  an  average  value  of  0.732.  The  relationship 
between  NDVI  values  and  DAS  (days  after  sowing)  or 
crop  age  has  been  showed  in  Figure  2.  The  logarithmic 
model could capture about 80 percent variability in NDVI 
values (t = 9.27, p<0.0001). 

141

The  difference  between  estimated  sowing  time  and 
observed sowing time ranged from 1 to 24 days with an 
average  difference  of  8  days.  The  standard  error  of 
estimates  was  9.22  days  for  the  estimates  made  after  an 
average  crop  age  of  78  days  when  all  the  plots  were 
considered in analysis. The standard error of estimate was 
little  higher  in  the  fitting  period  with  a  value  of  10.24 
days  while  it  was  considerably  low  in  estimating  period 
with a value of 6.42 days. 
The further analysis of results showed that the year 1996-
97 was not a good year for wheat growth as the crop age 
is underestimated by 5 days, while the year 1997-98 was a 
good  year 
for  wheat  growth  as  crop  age  was 
overestimated  by  6  days.  The  deviation  in  weather 
conditions from  its  average may  cause  error  in  crop  age 
estimation,  as  there  would  be  different  biomass  of  the 
same  aged  crop  in  different  year  depending  upon  the 
prevailing  weather  conditions.  Ritchie  et  al.  [18]  also 
identified  prevailing  weather  conditions  as  the  primary 
factors  of  spatial  and  temporal  variability  in  crop.

Observed Crop age during satellite pass
Estimated Crop age at satellite pass

Results showed that the approach described above could 
estimate  the  sowing  dates  with  reasonable  accuracy. 
Figure 3 showed that during different satellite passes there 
was large variation in crop age which varied from 41 to 
118  days  with  an  average  age  of  78  days,  while  the 
estimated  crop  age  varied  from  41  to  103  days  with  an 
average age of 79 days.

Crop cultivars also have bearing on age estimation due to 
the varying performance of different cultivars. The age of 
WH  series  was  over  estimated  by  3  days  while  age  of 
PBW series was underestimated by 1 day. Which suggest 
that  cultivars  produces  different  amount  of  biomass  at 
same age. Soils hydro-physical properties and topography 
[18]  of  the  field  also  play  a  great  role  in  deciding  the 
biomass production and resulting the crop age. The crop 
age was overestimated in the Plot-200 by an average of 6 
days while crop age was underestimate by 7 days in Plot-
193.    
 
 

4. Conclusion 
Obviously,  there  are  some  limitations  of  using  remote 
sensing for crop age and/ or sowing date estimation which 
ranges  differential  response  of  crop  cultivars  in  given 
environmental  condition,  inter-annual  varying  weather 
conditions  [19],  different  soils  [20]  in  different  regions 
and  topography  [21]  of  the  region.  In  addition  to  that, 
influence  of  management  practices  [19],  and  pest  and 
disease on crop also causes variation in crop biomass. The 
issue of different soil conditions and topography of region 
can  be  addressed  by  mapping  soil  [22  &  23]  through 
remote sensing and incorporating GIS [24] in the present 

142

[20] 

in  wheat  crop 

in  different  soil  and 

methodology,  which  will  lead  to  separate  fitting  of  crop 
spectral  curves 
topographical 
combinations.  Booltink  et  al. 
identified  soil 
variability a major source of crop spatial variability (-30 
to +32%). They further reported that the use of soil map 
can  explain  the  variability  in  crop  with  reasonable 
accuracy.  Lobell  et  al.  [19]  stated  that  majority  of 
variation 
is  coming  from  different 
management practices which may contribute up to 88.6% 
variability  and  can  be  explained  by  remote  sensing 
technique.  The  issue of differential  response  of different 
crop  cultivars  can  also  be  addressed  by  using  remote 
sensing  by  detecting  crop  cultivars  [25]  and  fitting 
different cultivars response curves. The impact of pest and 
disease  on  crop  biomass  can  be  identified  by  remote   
sensing  [26]  and  the  infected  area  can  be  treated 
separately.  Navalgund  [27]  and  Maracchi  et  al.  [28] 
discussed the various applications of remote sensing and 
GIS  in  agriculture  and  concluded  that  all  kind  of 
variability in crop can be addressed by remote sensing in 
conjunction with GIS. Further, accuracy can be increased 
by  use  of  multi-date  imageries.  In  present  study,  the

accuracy  was  also  limited  by  the  availability  of  satellite 
images, most of imageries were available when crop has 
attained sufficient age.  It was observed that the accuracy 
of estimating crop age is higher when the age of crop is 
less and vice-versa.  This was due the fact that when crop 
remains  in  uncontrolled  environmental  conditions  for 
longer period, it has more probability of getting affected 
by different kind of biotic and abiotic stresses. It can be 
concluded  from  above  results 
that  remote  sensing 
technique is a promising tool in capturing the variability 
in  crop  vigor  and  biomass  and  resulting  the  crop  stages 
and  crop  age.  The  estimation  of  crop  sowing  time  with 
remote sensing technique can be used for large area crop 
yield forecast / estimates using crop simulation model in 
GIS  environment.  Until  now, 
the  remote  sensing 
technique for large area yield forecast at any given time 
was  being  used  to  get  the  information  on  crop  biomass 
and  LAI  and  then  output  of  crop  simulation  models  are 
matched  with  remote  sensing  based  information  by 
iterative  adjustment  technique.  Thus,  information  of 
sowing time can eliminate the iterative adjustment of crop 
simulation model inputs.
