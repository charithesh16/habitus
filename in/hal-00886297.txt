Abstract  — Village irrigation  schemes cover about 25to of  the irrigated area on  the two banks 
of  the Senegal  River. We analyzed irrigation scheme and rice crop management  practices during 
the 1998 wet season in this type of irrigation  scheme in Mauritania.  Average  yield  was
4.8 t ha*'; problems with irrigation rules resulted in great variability of irrigation frequency 
between fields, and sub-optimal timing of nitrogen fertilizer application  resulted in  yield 
losses.  Based  on this diagnosis,  we suggested  to farmers  new irrigation  rules and cropping  
calendars planned on the scale of the irrigation scheme. Planned cropping calendars were built 
using Ca1Cu1, a software that we designed on the basis of the irrigated rice development model 
RIDEV. These suggestions of improved collective management  were implemented  in the 1999 and 2000 
wet seasons. Average yield reached 7.2 t ha*' in 1999 and 8.2 t ha*  in 2000, without any 
significant increase in production costs. This great increase in rice productivity was mainly due 
to better collective management obtained through planning cropping calendars. This result showed 
that technical innovation is not the only way to improve productivity.

1. INTRODUCTION

Irrigation  schemes in the Senegal River valley cover about 50 000 ha (SAED, 1997; SONADER, 1998). 
During the 1998
wet season, about 759c of this area was used, i.e. 20 000 ha in Senegal  and 18 000 ha in 
Mauritania,  almost  exclusively  for rice (Oryza  sativa  L.).  Potential  rice grain  yields  
(limited  by solar  radiation  and  temperature  only)  are  on  average  about 9 t ha  '  in  the  
wet  growing  season  from  July  to  November (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997) while actual average farmer 
yields are  about  5  t  ha  '  (SAED,  1997;  SONADER,  1998).  Agro- nomic  studies  (Le Gal,  
1997;  Wopereis  et  al.,  1999;  Haefele et al., 2001; Poussin et a1., 2003) identified 
sub-optimal timing of crop management interventions (i.e. date of sowing or trans- planting, 
herbicide and fertilizer applications,  and harvest and post-harvest activities)  as major 
constraints.
The structural  adjustment  programs  of  the 1990s have  put the responsibility for management of 
irrigation schemes in Sen- egal and Mauritania mostly back into farmers' hands. Decision- making on 
irrigation  schedules,  land  preparation,  purchase of inputs (fertilizers and herbicides), 
harvesting and marketing of

the product  is done collectively  on  the scale of  the irrigation scheme. Financing of production 
costs requires credit obtained through  collective  loans,  paid  back  after  harvest.  Moreover, 
previous loans have to be reimbursed to obtain a new one. Deci- sion-making  at the field  level  
by individual  farmers is, there- fore, strongly influenced by decisions taken collectively at the 
irrigation scheme level(Poussin, 1995; Le Gal and Papy, 1998). Moreover, improving the productivity 
for individual farmers in the collective irrigation  scheme is not sustainable.
To improve  rice  productivity,  best-bet  cropping  calendars need, therefore,  to be determined  
collectively  at both scheme and field levels. We hypothesize  that planning crop calendars on  the 
scale of  the irrigation  scheme  before the beginning  of the crop season can improve input 
efficiency and rice produc- tivity without any technical innovation.
The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate determi- nants of rice yield in a village 
irrigated scheme of the Senegal River valley; (ii) develop and evaluate a decision-support tool for 
improved cropping calendars at the irrigation scheme level;
(iii) analyze the effects of changes in collective decision-mak- ing on rice yields and 
profitability.

2. MATERIALS  AND METHODS

2.1. Site description
Studies  were implemented  in the village irrigation  scheme of  Nakhlet, a small village on the 
northern bank of the Senegal River, 60 km east of Rosso (16° 29’ N, 15° 12’ W) in Mauri- tania. 
This type of irrigation scheme (or perimeter), with an area of below 50 ha and cultivated by 
farmers from a single village, covers about 25% of the irrigated area on the two banks of the 
Senegal River (SAED, 1997; SONADER, 1998).
The perimeter of  Nakhlet was built in 1981 for the Mauri- tanian irrigation and extension 
authority, the “Société Nation- ale de Développement  Rural” (SONADER). It covers 27.5 ha, with 119 
fields cultivated  by 29 farmers. Irrigation is carried out through pumping from a tributary of the 
Senegal River. Irri- gated rice is cultivated only during the wet season, from mid- June to the end 
of November. Crop establishment in all fields is realized using a disk plow  and direct sowing ot 
pre-germi- nated seed. In 1998, 1999 and 2000, farmers used three indica cultivars  with  slender  
grain:  Sahel  108  (IR13240-108-2-2-3, short duration), Jaya  (medium  duration)  and Sahel  202 
(ITA
306, medium duration). The potential yields of these three cul- tivars are similar and are on 
average about 8 to 9 t ha  l  in the
wet season (Dingkuhn and Sow, 1997; WARDA, 1999).
After  about  10  years  under  semi-public  management,  the Nakhlet farmers' organization took 
over the perimeter manage- ment  from  1992.  The  farmers'  organization  manages  credit 
provision, water pumping and irrigation, input supply (i.e. her- bicides, fertilizers, fuel, etc.), 
and land preparation. Field irri- gation is done by farmers on a rotational basis. This functioning 
is typical of the village irrigation schemes on the two banks of the Senegal River (Diemer and van 
der Laan, 1987).


2.2.  Agronomic, hydraulic and economic survey

All 119 fields in the Nakhlet perimeter were monitored dur- ing  the  wet  seasons  of   1998,  
1999  and   2000  (1998WS, I999WS, 2000WS). The survey carried out in the l998WS was used to 
determine the initial situation in terms of crop and water management, and sources of yield gap and 
variability. The top- soil  (0  to 0.2 m depth)  from  all fields  was  sampled  in  1998 before 
the onset of the growing season (one composite sample from 4 samples taken at random per field). 
Soi1 analyses (clay content, C and N content, P-Olsen, pH, electrical conductivity, CEC and 
exchangeable K) were conducted in the IRD labora- tory in Dakar, Senegal, following standard  
methodologies.
The cultivars sown, type of seed (certified or retained from previous harvest), types and rates of 
applied fertilizers, type of weed control (manual or chemical) and rates of applied herbi- cides 
were recorded for each field. The dates of each manage- ment  intervention  (i.e.  land  
preparation,  irrigation,  sowing, weed control, fertilizer applications and harvesting) were also 
recorded.  Moreover,  visual  scores  of  weed  infestation  were taken at panicle initation in 
each field. Four scores, correspond- ing to four classes of surface area coverage by weeds, were 
dis- tinguished: 0 for none; 1 for weak (less than 10% ot surface area coverage by weeds); 2 for 
strong (between 10 and 30%), 3 for
very strong (more than 30% of surface area coverage by weeds). Poussin et al. (2003) showed that a 
weed surface cover of  less than 10% at panicle initation corresponded  to a dry weed bio- mass of 
between 0 and 24 g m*², a surface cover between 10 and 309o corresponded  to a weed biomass of 
between 13 and
228 g m  2, and a cover  of  more than  309a  corresponded  to a
biomass greater than 130 g m  2.Grain yield (corrected for l49o
moisture) was determined at maturity in the center of each field using a sampling area of 25 m*. 
Grain rice yield of the whole field can be slightly overestimated, but comparisons  between years 
at the perimeter level are still relevant.
The volume of water pumped into the Nakhlet perimeter in 1998 and 1999 was monitored daily during 
the wet season. The discharge  measurement   at  the  head  of   the  perimeter  was ensured  
through  a  rectangular  weir  installed  at  the  outflow point of the stilling basin of  the 
pump. The characteristics of this flume (length, width and discharge coefficient) enabled the 
calculation,  using  the Manning-Strickler formula,  of  the dis- charge  according  to  the  water 
 level  upstream  of  the  flume,
measured through a gauge p1aced inside the stilling basin (Bos et a1., 1991): Q = 
Cd.b.(2.g)0,5.H''5. Where Q is the discharge (in m3 s*¹), b the breadth of the control section (m), 
Cd the dis-
charge coefficient, g the gravitational acceleration  (m s²) and H  the  upstream  head  above  the 
 crest  (m).  A  counter  was installed on the pump to measure the operational hours. Irriga- tion 
water volume was estimated to be 709c of pumped inflow to allow for conveyance losses (Tuzet and 
Perrier, 1998). We further assumed that irrigation  water was distributed homoge- neously  in  the  
irrigated  fields.  No  measurements  were  con- ducted during the 2000 wet season, as similar 
water allocation rules were applied  to those in 1999.
Farmers financed their production costs through bank loans obtained  by  the farmers'  
organization.  The  Nakhlet farmers' organization  purchased inputs and provided farmers with cer- 
tified seeds, fertilizers and herbicides, according  to the area of their  fields.  After  harvest, 
 farmers  reimbursed  the  farmers' organization  in  rice  paddy,  which  was  sold  by  the 
farmers' organization  to pay  back the bank.  Rice paddy  is sold  to the state,  which  
guarantees  a paddy  price of  between  38 and  45 Uguiya (Mauritanian  currency [UM]) per kg (1 UM 
= 0.0032 Euro as of March 2004), depending on milling recovery (SON- ADER, 1998). A financial 
survey was conducted at the perim- eter  level  during  the  1998,  1999  and  2000  wet  seasons. 
Production costs were calculated for each individual field. Irri- gation costs included fuel, 
engine oil, maintenance  and pump attendant salary. Cropping costs included land preparation, use 
of  certified  seeds,  and purchase of  fertilizers  and  herbicides. Their costs corresponded to 
suppliers' and providers' invoices. Costs  of  seeds  retained  from  the previous  harvest  were 
esti- mated  as 45  UM  kg*'.  Harvest  was done  manually  by  each farmer in the 1998 and 1999 
wet seasons and by a combine har- vester through a service provider in the 2000WS. Comparison 
between  years  was  made excluding  harvest  costs.  Organiza- tional changes in 1999 and 2000 did 
not modify the amount of work  done  by  the  farmers.  Comparison  between  years  was made 
excluding labor costs. The gross product of the perimeter corresponded  to  the  total  rice  paddy 
 production  value.  The average paddy selling price was 42 UM kg*’

2.3.  Use of models for diagnosis: evapotranspiration, potential yield and development of irrigated 
rice
Daily rainfall during the 1998, 1999 and 2000 wet seasons was measured in Nakhlet using a 
pluviometer. Reference eva- potranspiration  was  calculated   using  the  Penman-Monteith equation 
 (Smith  et a1.,  1992; Allen et a1.,  1998) and  weather data  recorded  at the experimental  
station  of  WARDA  (West African Rice Development Association) in Fanaye (16° 33’ N, 15° 46’ W), 
near  Nakhlet,  on  the Senegalese  bank. The eva- potranspiration of  rice is calculated  by 
multiplying  the refer- ence evapotranspiration with a varying crop factor (kc). The set of  
kc-values  given  by FAO (1986)  and Siddeek et al. (1988) are used:  kc  being  1.15 during  the  
vegetative  growth  phase,
1.3 during the reproductive phase, and 1.05 after the first week of maturation. Cumulative 
potential evapotranspiration of rice during the crop season was compared with the total of 
irrigation water supply and rainfall.
The  rice  growth  model  ORYZAS  (Dingkuhn  and  Sow, 1997) simulates energy-limited and 
temperature-limited poten- tial rice yield in the Sahel using daily minimum and maximum 
temperatures, solar radiation and geographical latitude (to cal- culate photoperiod). This model 
was used to calculate potential yields  in  the 1998WS,  1999WS  and  2000WS  using  climatic data 
recorded in Fanaye.
The rice phenology  model RIDEV (Dingkuhn  et a1., 1995) simulates irrigated rice development in 
the Sahel and provides crop management recommendations based on crop phenology at the field level. 
For a cultivar, a sowing date and a planting method  (direct  sowing  or  transplanting),  RIDEV  
provides
(i) the percentage of spikelet sterility due to cold or heat during flowering;  (ii)  dates  of  
critical  stages  in  rice  development (flowering  and  maturity),  and  (iii)  optimal  timing  
for  trans- planting,  weeding,  fertilizer  application,  last drainage  before harvest and 
harvest. Input data are geographical latitude of the site, daily  minimum  and maximum  
temperatures,  and photo- thermal characteristics of the rice cultivar (Dingkuhn and Miezan, 1995). 
This model was used to reconstruct the rice development and to determine spikelet sterility 
percentage in each field dur- ing the wet seasons of 1998, 1999 and 2000 using daily tem- peratures 
recorded in Fanaye. RIDEV was also used to evaluate differences  between optimal and actual 
cropping calendars in each field.

2.4. Planning cropping calendars at the perimeter level
RIDEV was used to develop Ca1Cu1(“Ca1endrier Cultural”), a software package written in the C 
language for the Microsoft Disk Operating System, that provides an optimal cropping cal- endar for 
irrigated rice on the scale of irrigation schemes in the Sahel   (Poussin,   2000).  This  cropping 
 calendar   takes  into account  the organization  of  collective  operations  (i.e. opera- tions 
that are collectively  managed):  mechanized  land prepa- ration,  flooding   before  land  
preparation   (pre-flooding)  or before  sowing  (flooding),  transplanting  and mechanized  har- 
vest(manual harvest is often carried out individually, but mech- anised  harvest  is  carried  out  
collectively).  Input  data  are:
(i) planned date for the start of the sowing period; (ii) rice cul- tivar sown; (iii) planting 
method (assumed to be common to all fields); (iv) duration of each collective operation for the 
whole


perimeter,  i.e.  land  preparation,  flooding  and  pre-flooding (assumed  to last  the  same  
time),  transplanting  (if  this  is  the planting method chosen) and harvest. Moreover, in the 
case of pre-flooding,  the average duration of soil drainage is needed.
To prevent leakage, flooding and land preparation are usu- ally not performed at the same time; 
fields are usually flooded just before sowing or transplanting  and this first flooding can last 2 
days for each field. The optimal timing of transplanting, fertilizer top-dressed applications and 
harvest are based on rice phenology.  To  obtain  an  optimal  cropping  calendar  in  each field, 
operations  (sowing,  transplanting, fertilizer top-dressed applications and harvest) should have 
the same duration at the perimeter  level.  Without  a  common  duration  (for  example, sowing 
nursery lasts 2 days and transplanting  lasts 15 days on the scale of the perimeter), timing will 
be sub-optimal in some fields. The slowest collective operation set is therefore the com- mon 
duration of all the cultural interventions, particularly sowing.
Farmers   often   choose   their   rice   cultivar   individually (Poussin, 1995) and direct sowing 
and transplanting can coexist in the same irrigation  scheme (Poussin,  1997).  Nevertheless, they 
can agree to choose one or two common cultivars, or cul- tivars with similar duration. The cultivar 
with the shortest dura- tion  would  then  be sown  at  the end  of  the  sowing  period  to 
minimize the total crop duration on the scale of the perimeter. Direct sowing and  transplanting  
lead to different  crop devel- opment duration for the same cultivar. In the case of both plant- 
ing  methods,  two  cropping  calendars  at  the  perimeter  level should be made.
Ca1Cu1 uses the phenology  model RIDEV (Dingkuhn et a1., 1995) to simulate rice development  for 
the first cultivar sown at the beginning of the sowing period (S1), and for the second cultivar 
sown at the end of the sowing period (S2). The duration of  the sowing  period is the duration  of 
the slowest collective operation. These 2 simulations (S1 and S2) are made using his- torical 
weather data recorded near the site. Each simulation pro- vides average and extremes of dates for 
several stages (Fig. 1): start  of  tillering,  panicle  initiation,  heading,  flowering  and 
maturity.  Spikelet  sterility  percentages  (average  and  maxi- mum) for S1 and S2 are also 
calculated.
At the perimeter level, the timing of each stage will be an average  between the mean of  dates for 
S1 and S2, and could start at the earliest at the minimum date for SI  and could end at the latest 
at the  maximum date for S2. The starting and end dates (averages  and extremes)  of crop 
management  interven- tions (weed management, fertilizer applications,  last drainage and harvest) 
are based on rice phenology. The first flooding can last 2 days for each field and ends the day  
before sowing (or transplanting); land preparation ends just before flooding starts (it can end at 
the latest the day before the end of flooding); pre- flooding starts according  to the duration of 
soil drainage.
The weeding and fertilizer  management  suggested  by Cal- Cul  complies   with  WARDA   
recommendations  (Wopereis et a1., 2001). The first weeding can be done chemically with pre- 
emergence or post-emergence herbicides, and a second weeding can be done manually before the second 
N top dressing. Nitro- gen  fertilizer  supply  is suggested  to be split  into  2 or  3 top- 
dressed applications at the start of tillering, panicle initation and possibly heading. P and K 
fertilizer management is not specified. Contrary to SONADER and SAED (“Société d’Aménagement

2.5. Technical organization changes
Surveys during the 1998WS showed great variability in irri- gation  frequency  between  fields,  
and  sub-optimal  timing  of nitrogen fertilizer application  resulted in rice yield losses (see 
details in results and discussion). This diagnosis of the 1998WS


delay  was, therefore,  17 days for Jaya and 20 days for Sahel 108.
RIDEV simulations indicated no problems with spikelet ste- rility in any field (i.e. simulated  
spikelet sterility ratio < 59c) and  average  of  potential  yield  calculated   with  the  model
ORYZAS was 8.7 t ha*’ for Jaya and 8.2 t ha*' for Sahel 108.

was  explained  and  discussed  with  farmers  during  a  general meeting  in  Nakhlet  in  April  
1999.  Farmers  were  invited  to
Rice grain yield measured  at maturity  ran to 7.1 t ha*¹, with  an average of 4.8 t ha
ed from 2.7 t ha*' Low  yields  were

implement  several  changes  in  their  technical  organization.
These changes were meant to (i) reduce the variability in irri- gation frequency between fields and 
(ii) reduce the gap between optimal and actual cropping calendars.
Thus, it was suggested to continue the water allocation cycle after rain (i.e. water allocation is 
not re-initialized and re-starts alter rain in the next fields). In order to install an information 
system on field irrigation,  a map of the perimeter (based on a cadastral survey; all the farmers 
could identify their own fields on this map) was posted showing  weekly  which fields had to be 
irrigated (based on the irrigation schedule). The farmer who was in charge of field irrigation had 
to notify on this map which fields were irrigated in order to inform the other farmers (field 
irrigation is done by farmers on a rotational basis). It was also suggested they should plan 
cropping calendars at the perimeter level for the next wet season and post a map of the perimeter 
(based on a cadastral survey) showing weekly which operation had to be done and which field had to 
be treated (based on the planned cropping calendars and water allocation cycle). Agri- cultural 
advisors of SONADER, that were present at the general meeting, also suggested in the 1999WS 
pre-flooding one month before land preparation  in order to reduce early weed infesta- tion,  and  
using  certified  seed  of  Sahel  202  in  the  2000WS. Farmers accepted  these suggestions.  They 
chose furthermore to grow only one cultivar (Jaya in the 1999WS and Sahel 202 in the 2000WS) and to 
delay the sowing period to make sure harvest would be alter the rainy period.
Planned  cropping  calendars  were  built  for  the  1999  and 2000WS using Ca1Cu1 (Fig. l). 
Flooding was the slowest collec- tive operation and set the common duration ot crop management 
interventions  on  the  scale  of  perimeter.  After  this  planning, there was no interference in 
farmers' practices during the crop- ping season. The surveys  made in the 1999WS  and 2000WS were 
compared with the 1998WS to evaluate the effects of these changes on yields and profitability.


3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Diagnosis of the 1998 wet season
In the  I998WS, farmers  sowed Jaya between  20 June and 1 July (Tab. I) on 15.5 ha (65 fields) and 
Sahel 108 on 12.5 ha (54 fields). Sahel 108 was cultivated in Nakhlet for the first time that  
year.  Sahel  108  seeds  were  certified;  Jaya  seeds  were retained from the previous harvest. 
Harvest occurred from 4 to 7 November, an average of 135 days after sowing for Jaya and 129 days 
after sowing for Sahel 108. All fields were manually harvested. Maturity dates simulated with the 
model RIDEV for each field were an average of 118 days after sowing for Jaya and 109 days after 
sowing for Sahel 108. The average harvest
mainly  localized  in  the  fields  far  away  from  the  irrigation source. The average yield for 
Jaya (5.5 t ha   ) was significantly higher (Student's test, P < 0.0001) than for Sahel 108 (4.0 t 
ha° ). Farmers wanted therefore to understand the origins of yield var- iability and the clear 
differences between cultivars.
3.1.1. Soif variability
The results of soil analyses corresponded well with soil char- acteristics  in  irrigated  schemes  
of  the  Senegal  River  valley described by Haefele et al. (2001). Topsoil clay content varied 
with distance from the bank, ranging from about 359o to 559c. C content ranged from 4.4 to 7.9 g mg 
kg    soil, with an average of 6.2 g kg° , and  N content ranged from 0.37 to 0.71 g kg°' soil,  
with  an average of  0.52 g kg* . CEC varied  from 18  to 29 cmol kg*¹ and  was well correlated  
with clay content (r² 0.823). Exchangeable K ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 cmol kg*' soil, with an average 
of 0.7 cmol kg*'. P-Olsen ran  ed from 4.3 to 17 mg kg  ' soil, with an average of 10.2 mg kg°   P 
and K avail- abilities are above the critical levels for rice (Dobermann et al., 1995; Sanchez, 
1976). Electrical conductivity ranged from 0.4 to 1.5 mS cm*¹ with an average of 0.9 mS cm*¹, and 
pH ranged from 5.8 to 6.5 with an average of 6.1, which do not constitute constraints for irrigated 
 rice cropping  when  irrigation  is well managed (Asch and Wopereis, 2000). We assumed, therefore, 
that initial soil P and K status, and soil salinity levels when irri- gation is well managed,  were 
not hampering rice growth.
3.1.2. Irrigation management
Irrigation started on 19 June 1998 with flooding before direct sowing  and ended on 30 September  
1998. The  total  pumped water volume was 265 700 m3, including 79 000 m3 for flood- ing (Tab. II). 
The average irrigation water supply in the fields was estimated  at 756 mm and rainfall  was 207  
mm,  whereas evapotranspiration of the rice was estimated  at 802 mm. The total of irrigation water 
supply and rainfall was about 160 mm above  the  evapotranspiration  of  the  rice,  but  water  
losses through percolation could be estimated at about 2 mm per day (i.e. more than 200 mm from 
sowing to maturity) for this type of soil (Raes et a1., 1997).
Fields were irrigated 4 to 9 times after flooding. Estimated irrigation water supply (flooding 
included) ranged from 528 mm to 828 mm as a function of irrigation frequency (Tab. III). Irri- 
gation frequency and irrigation water supply were lower in the fields relatively far away from the 
irrigation source, that were mostly sown with Sahel 108. Water allocation  rules based on 
re-initializing the water allocation cycle after rain contributed to  this  irrigation  frequency  
heterogeneity  (water  allocation cycle started in the fields near to the irrigation source). 
Effects of irrigation frequency (through irrigation water supply and risk of  water  shortage)  on  
rice  yield  during  the  1998WS  were strongly significant (Student's  test, P < 0.0001). Fields

less than 7 times after flooding  were mainly  sown  with Sahel 108 (Tab. III); the irrigation

times after flooding were mainly sown with Jaya; the irrigation water supply was above 700 mm and 
the average yield was 5.3 t ha  '. This could explain the yield gap between Jaya and Sahel
108. Nevertheless, the average of yield obtained with Jaya was still significantly  higher in the 
fields irrigated 6 to 7 times after flooding,  where both cultivars  were sown (see Tab. III).

3.1.3. Weeding and fertilizer management
A total of  IU   liters of propanil and 55 liters of  2,4-D amine were bought by the Nakhlet 
farmers'  organization  before the 1998WS  and  distributed  to  farmers  according  to  the  
surface area of their fields. The first weeding was done using herbicides in  all  fields  with  an 
 average  of  4  liters  of  propanil  ha     and 2 liters of 2,4-D amine ha*  , combined. The 
timing of herbicide application  was  on  average  27  days  after  sowing.  The  delay between 
optimal (simulated with the model RIDEV) and actual
weeding timing ranged from —2 to 17 days. Despite heavy weed infestation observed at panicle 
initation (average of visual score
> 1, see Tab. I), a second manual weeding was only done on a minority  of fields. Late weeding  
with low herbicide rates and virtual  absence  of   manual   weeding   was  also  observed   by 
Haefele et al. (2001) as a usual practice in Mauritania,  and by Poussin  et  a1.  (2003)  in  
Senegal.  Moreover,  visual  scores  of weed infestation  at panicle initation  were greater in the 
fields far  from  the  irrigation  source  (with  low  irrigation  frequency and, therefore, high 
risk of water shortage), mostly sown with Sahel 108.
The Nakhlet farmers'  organization  bought 7 tonnes of  urea (46% of  N) and  2.75 tonnes of triple 
superphosphate (209c  of P). Fertilizers were given to farmers proportionally to their cul- tivated 
area at the rate of 250 kg urea ha     (115 kg N ha    ) and 100 kg  triple  superphosphate (20 kg  
P  ha*’),  i.e. close  to the recommendations of  120  kg N ha*’ and  20 kg P ha*’. 117 kg N ha  '  
and 19 kg P ha°   were applied in two top-dressed appli- cations (Tab. I). Farmers had problems 
dividing fertilizer bags.

That  explained  the  variability   of  applied   N  fertilizer,   that ranged from 90 k   N ha  ' 
to 150 kg N ha  '.  Nevertheless, rates over 90 kg N ha*  did not have a significant effect on rice 
yield (Fig. 2). This corresponded to a strong variability ofN  fertilizer efficiency  already  
observed  by  Wopereis  et  a1.  (1999)  and
Haefele et al. (2001) in similar situations.
All farmers applied fertilizer  in two top-dressings  (Tab. I). With the first split, on average  
at 36 days after sowing,  all of the triple superphosphate and half ot the urea were applied. The 
rest of the urea was applied at about 60 days alter sowing. Opti mal dates simulated  with  RIDEV 
for these two splits were on average 23 days after sowing and 60 days after sowing for Jaya and  23 
days  alter  sowing  and  50  days  after  sowing  for Sahel
108. The delay  between actual and optimal dates ranged from

yield  (Fig. 3),  i.e.  decreasing applied  N  efficiency.  The delay  of  the second  split  for 
Sahel 108 (on average 11 days) was greater than for Jaya (on average 1 day).  Farmers  respected  
quite  well  agricultural  advice  that
1998, 1999 and 2000 wet seasons (1998WS, 1999WS, 2000WS) as a function of total applied  N 
fertilizer (kg ha
recommended  a  second  split  at  60  days  after  sowing  (SON-             Therefore,    lower   
irrigation    frequency    combined    with ADER, 1998). However, this recommendation did not 
concord        stronger  weed  infestation  and  greater  delays  for  N  fertilizer with Sahel  
108 duration,  which  is on average  10 days shorter        application  in fields sown  with Sahel 
 108 than in fields sown than Jaya duration in the wet season (RIDEV simulations  with        with 
Jaya explained the yield differences observed between the daily temperatures  recorded  in Rosso, 
1970-1984).                           two cultivars.

evapotranspiration of the rice was estimated  at 774 mm compared  with 802 mm in the 1998WS. The

planning, and all fields were irrigated 8 or 9 times after flooding. The increase in irrigation  
frequency compared with the 1998WS did not lead to a strong increase in pumped water amount. In the 
2000WS, farmers  did not pre-flood  and all fields were irrigated 8 or 9 times alter flooding,

3.2. Diagnosis of the 1999 and 2000 wet seasons
In the 1999 and 2000 wet seasons, the   otential rice grain yields were between 8.8 t ha    and 9.2 
t ha    (i.e. about  I  t ha more than in the 1998WS) whilst the average of the actual yield 
increased  greatly  (Tab. I). It  reached  7.2  t  ha  '  in  1999  and
8.2 I ha*   in  2000  (i.e.  2.4  and  3.4  I  ha*'  more  than  in  the I998WS).   Nevertheless,   
the   standard   deviation   of   yield increased  slightly  (1.4 t ha*  in 1999 and 1.8 t ha*' in 
2000), indicating continued heterogeneity  between fields.
3.2.1.  Irrigation management
In  the  1999WS,  the  total  pumped  water  was  78 100  m3 higher than in the 1998WS (Tab. II). 
This increase was mainly due to a pre-flooding irrigation that used 70 100 m3 of pumped
water. The first flooding  used 70 300 m3 (8 700 m3 less than
in the 1998WS) and irrigation after flooding used 233 000 m (16 700 m3 more than in the 1998WS). 
The average irrigation water  supply  (excluding  pre-flooding)  in  the fields  was esti- mated  
at 768 mm. Rainfall  contributed  183 mm. Total water
the water allocation rules and irrigation plan.
The increase in irrigation frequency reduced the risk of water shortage. Based on the I998WS 
results (Tab. III), the increase in irrigation frequency  alone could not explain the increase in 
rice yield with the Jaya cultivar (1.7 t ha°' in 1999 and 2.7 t ha° in 2000). Irrigation management 
was therefore not the only fac- tor contributing  to yield increase.

3.2.2. Land preparation,  flooding and sowing

In the 1999 and 2000WS, farmers chose to delay the sowing period to make sure that harvesting would 
not occur during the rainy period, while keeping a spikelet sterility percentage lower than 10% 
(simulated with the software CalCul using daily tem- peratures recorded in Rosso, 1970-1984). In 
the 1999WS, most farmers used the cultivar Jaya, with seeds retained from the pre- vious  harvest  
(despite  the  recommendations  of  agricultural advisors). With sowing between 7 and 22 July, 
maturity came in early November (Tab. I). In the 2000WS, they used cultivar Sahel  202, with  
certified  seeds (as recommended  by agricul- tural  advisors).  With  sowing  between  19 July  
and 4 August, maturity came at the end of November. Spikelet sterility sim- ulated with the model 
RIDEV for both wet seasons was lower than 10% in all fields.
Planned  sowing dates were well respected in the 1999 and 2000WS (see Tab. I). The planned cropping 
calendar indicated the start of  first flooding  3 days  before  sowing,  but farmers sowed the 
same day as flooding. Land preparation was realized using disk plows 2 days before flooding in the 
l 999WS and one week before flooding in the 2000WS, and lasted 3 or 4 days in both wet seasons. The 
gap between  actual and  planned  dates for land preparation  and flooding  had no effect on 
following crop management interventions.
In  the  1999WS,  fields  were  pre-flooded  about  2  weeks before the planned period (from 5 May 
to 6 June vs. from 5 to 17 June, see Tab. I) to be sure that weeds could come up before land 
preparation.  Weeds  were eliminated  by land preparation about 1  month after pre-flooding. Early  
weed infestation  was low and farmers refrained from herbicide use. In spite of its effi- ciency on 
early weed control and its low cost (fuel consumption was  about  1 000  liters  for  pre-flooding, 
  corresponding   to 66 000 UM; see Tab. IV), farmers did not repeat pre-flooding in the 2000WS. 
Pre-flooding requires the farmers'  presence at Nakhlet one month before the beginning of the crop 
season, but the farmers have other activities as well as irrigated agriculture (Diemer and van der 
Laan, 1987).

3.2.3. Weed and fertilizer management
In the 1999WS, early weed infestation levels were low. Most farmers   preferred   manual   weeding  
 to  save  money   (about 150 000  UM  for  the  whole  perimeter;  see  Tab. IV).  Manual weeding  
was done at 25 days after sowing (see Tab. I), but it

lasted until 13 September in some fields and therefore delayed the  first  N  application.  Visual  
scores  ot  weed  infestation  at panicle  initation  were on average  lower than  in the 1998WS, 
but  standard  deviations  (1 .6  in  the   l999WS  vs.  1.2  in  the 1998WS) indicated strong 
variability  between fields.

In the 2000WS, farmers applied a combination  of propanil (4 liters ha  ')  and 2,4 D amine (2 
liters ha   ) as in the I998WS (Tab. I). Herbicides were applied 6 days late compared with the 
planned timing. This delay is partially due to the delivery date (19 August 2000) of the fertilizer 
and herbicides. Weeding on fields  sown  before  29  July  was  therefore  inevitably  delayed 
(Fig. 4). This delay of the herbicide treatment directly induced a delay  of the first N 
application.  Weed infestation  at panicle initation  was  not  very  serious  in  most  fields  
(average  visual score < 1), but it was greater in fields sown before 29 July (aver- age visual 
score  l .8).
In the 1999 and 2000WS, farmers ordered 3 tonnes of diam- monium-phosphate  (l 89o  N,  209o  P)  
and  5.5  tonnes  of  urea (469o  N)  with  planned  application  rates  of  100 kg  diammo- 
nium-phosphate ha*¹ and  200 kg urea ha*¹, i.e. 20 kg P ha*' and  110  kg  N ha*'.  However,  
diammonium-phosphate ferti- lizer was not available. Thus, 8.5 tonnes of urea were delivered and  
given  to  farmers  at  the  rate  of  300  kg  urea  ha   .  Total applied N was on average 152 kg 
ha*' in the 1999 and 2000WS,
Figure 4. Difference  between  RIDEV  simulated optimal  timing  of weeding and actual weeding 
(weeding delay) as a function of sowing date during the 2000 wet season.


with a standard deviation of about 20 kg ha*  . Compared  with the I998WS, the increase in applied 
N alone could not explain the increase in rice yield. The relation between  total applied N and 
rice yield showed, in fact, that the maximum yield (about 10 t ha*', see Fig. 2) was reached in the 
2000WS with a minimum rate of  about 120 kg N ha*¹, i.e. equal to the average  applied N  rate  in  
the  1998WS.  This  observation  agrees  well  with WARDA recommendations about N fertilizer rates 
(Wopereis et  al.,  2001).  Yield  measured  on  samples  overestimated  the yield  of  fields  and 
 could  therefore  exceed  the potential  yield calculated  with the model ORYZAS.  Nevertheless,  
the maxi- mum yield observed in the 1999 and 2000WS indicated that the potential  yield  for  Jaya  
and  Sahel  202  should  be  reached  in many fields.

et a1.


As  in  the  1998WS,  N fertilizer  was  applied  in  two equal splits. The planned  timing for the 
first split was 23 days after sowing  (from 3 to 13 August in the 1999WS and irom 14 to 25 August 
in the 2000WS, see Tab. I) and the planned timing for  the second split was 56 days after sowing in 
the 1999WS (from  5  to  15  September)  and  58  days  after  sowing  in  the 2000WS (from 18 to 
27 September). The delays between opti- mal and actual timings were on average 9 days in the 1999WS 
and  6 days  in  2000WS  for  the  first  split,  and  2  days  in  the 1999WS  and 4 days in the 
2000WS for the second split. The first split delay was still greater than the second split delay. 
In the I 999WS, manual weeding partially explained the delay in the first N; in the 2000WS, the 
herbicide and fertilizer delivery date partially explain this delay in fields sown before 29 July. 
Nevertheless, delays were significantly reduced (Fischer's test, P < 0.05)  in  the  1999  and  
2000WS  as  compared  with  the 1998WS.  As in the  I998WS, N fertilizer application delay in the 
1999 and 2000WS induced a great drop in maximum yield (Fig. 3).

3.2.4.  Harvest
Farmers  were able to harvest  their fields on time, close to maturity of the rice plants in the 
1999WS, with an average grain yield  of 7.2 t ha* . In the 2000Ws, combine  harvesters  were used 
about 13 days after maturity, and the average grain yield was 8.2 I ha*

3.3. Financial  profits
During  the  1998WS,  total  costs  at  the  perimeter  level (excluding harvesting) amounted to 
1.7 million UM, whilst rice paddy production value was 5.4 million UM, and the gross mar- gin was 
3.7 million UM (Tab. IV). The gross margin increased to 6.8 million UM in the l999WS and to 7.5 
million UM in the 2000WS. Gross margins roughly doubled, therefore, compared with 1998. Moreover,  
except for pre-flooding,  organizational changes did not increase labor input: timings of crop 
interven- tions   were  modified,   but  the  amount  of   work  done  was unchanged.
Rice yield increase is the main factor contributing to this result. As  compared  with  the  
1998WS,  production  costs  decreased slightly in 1999 as less herbicides were used despite the 
intro- duction of pre-flooding. Production costs further increased in the 2000WS  due to  the  use 
of  certified  seeds  and  the fuel  price increase.   Similar   results   were  obtained   in  
Mauritania   by WARDA  working  with  large-scale  farmers  cultivating  their own irrigation 
scheme (Haefele et al., 2001).
At the field level, gross margins ranged from about 50 000 to   250 000   UM   ha°    in   the   
I998WS,   from   50 000   to
375 000 UM   ha*'   in   the   1999WS   and   from   100 000   to 400 000 UM hall in the 2000WS 
(Fig. 5). The increase in gross margins per hectare was strongly significant (multiple compar-
ison using Sheffe's test, P < 0.0001). Moreover, gross margin per hectare for the fields sown after 
29 July in the 2000WS (late arrival of fertilizers and herbicides did not affect these fields) 
varied from about 250 000 to 400 000 UM ha* , i.e. above the gross margin range in the 1998WS. 
Combine harvesting in the 2000WS cost about 40 000 UM ha*'. Each farmer could easily pay for this 
supplementary  expense.

4. CONCLUSION
Despite roughly similar growth conditions for rice cropping, the gap between potential and actual 
yield ranged from 2.7 to
7.1 I ha*¹ in the l998WS. Farmers used two cultivars (Jaya and Sahel 108) that had similar 
potential yields, but the actual yield obtained with Sahel 108 was lower as compared with Jaya. As 
shown by another study in the Senegal River valley (Poussin et a1., 2003), variability in crop 
management practices was the main contributing factor to this heterogeneity. The survey dur- ing  
the  1998WS  revealed  high  variability  for  irrigation  fre- quency,  for  weeding  and  N 
application  timing,  and for  total applied  N  rate.  Irrigation  frequency,  through  risk  of  
water shortage, had a significant effect on yield, and increasing delay ofN application led to 
large yield drops. Total applied N ranged from 90 to 150 kg ha* , but no direct relation was found 
with rice yield, suggesting a strong variability of N fertilizer appar- ent recovery rate. The 
water allocation  rules led to low irriga- tion frequency  in fields far from the irrigation  
source. These

fields were mainly sown with Sahel 108. Higher weed infesta- tion (partially due to lower 
irrigation frequency) combined with greater  delay  toy  a  second  N  application  in  fields  
sown  with Sahel 108 explained  the yield gap compared  with Jaya.
Based on this diagnosis, farmers were invited to change their water allocation rules in order to 
homogenize fields'  irrigation frequency, and to make on the scale of the perimeter a planned 
cropping calendar for the next season to improve the timing of crop  management  interventions  in 
all fields. During  the 1999 and 2000WS, all fields were irrigated 8 to 9 times after flooding and 
delays between optimal and actual N fertilizer application timings  were  reduced.  The  average  
rice  grain  yield  reached
7.2 t ha*' in the I 999WS and 8.2 t ha*' in the 2000WS, whereas production  costs at the perimeter 
level remained stable. Over- all, gross margins at the perimeter level increased by more than 809c 
as compared  with the  l998WS. This increase in irrigated rice productivity  was mainly due to 
better collective manage- ment improving  input use efficiencies.
These results confirm the importance of good crop manage- ment  in  general  in  irrigated  systems 
 in  the  Sahel  (Wopereis et a1.,  2001).  Current  crop  management  techniques  allow  one to 
reach the potential yields of the rice cultivars used. However, farmers' collective organization at 
the perimeter level and farmers' individual  practices  at the field level are often sub-optimal.  
If herbicide  and  fertilizer  rates  are  often  close  to recommenda- tions,  crop  management  
operation  timings  are often  delayed. Making a planned cropping calendar can therefore assist 
farm- ers with crop management.  Technical innovation is, therefore, not the only way to improve 
agricultural productivity.
Soil fertility and crop management by farmers in the Senegal River  valley  could  also depend  on 
other  external  actors,  such as suppliers and motorized service providers. In our study, soil P 
fertility management depended  on the availability  of P ferti- lizer in the suppliers, and late 
input delivery led to delayed her- bicide  and  fertilizer  applications.  Le  Gal  (1997)  showed  
the dependence on combine harvester  availability  for double rice cropping farmers in the Senegal 
River delta. In order to prepare for  these delivery  delays  or  input  and  agricultural  
machinery availabilities, planning  cropping  calendars  can  help  farmers' organizations  to 
enter early into a contract  with  suppliers and providers.
