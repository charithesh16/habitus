Abstract
Economic growth and modernization of society are generally associated with fertility rate
decreases but which forces trigger this is unclear. In this paper we assess how fertility
changes with increased labor market participation of women in rural Senegal. Evidence
from high-income countries suggests that higher female employment rates lead to reduced
fertility rates but evidence from developing countries at an early stage of demographic tran-
sition is largely absent. We concentrate on a rural area in northern Senegal where a recent
boom in horticultural exports has been associated with a sudden increase in female off-farm
employment. Using survey data we show that employed women have a significantly higher
age at marriage and at first childbirth, and significantly fewer children. As causal identifica-
tion strategy we use instrumental variable and difference-in-differences estimations, com-
bined with propensity score matching. We find that female employment reduces the number
of children per woman by 25%, and that this fertility-reducing effect is as large for poor as for
non-poor women and larger for illiterate than for literate women. Results imply that female
employment is a strong instrument for empowering rural women, reducing fertility rates and
accelerating the demographic transition in poor countries. The effectiveness of family plan-
ning programs can increase if targeted to areas where female employment is increasing or
to female employees directly because of a higher likelihood to reach women with low-fertility
preferences. Our results show that changes in fertility preferences not necessarily result
from a cultural evolution but can also be driven by sudden and individual changes in
economic opportunities.

Introduction
Developing countries have high fertility rates and face rapid population growth, leading to vari-
ous environmental and social concerns [1]. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) total fertility rates are
among the highest in the world with 5.1 births per woman in 2012 compared to 1.7 for high-
income countries [2]. A reduction in fertility rates is considered to be beneficial for these coun-
tries as it is associated with improved child and maternal health, empowerment of women, and

poverty and hunger alleviation [3,4]—and hence contributes to achieve the first, third, fourth
and fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG).

Since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), many

developing countries have invested in family planning programs to reduce fertility rates. These
programs mainly focus on improving knowledge about birth control and access to contracep-
tives. Total fertility rates (TFR) dropped since the 1990s but less so in SSA than in other low-
and middle-income regions. In SSA the TFR decreased from 6.4 in 1990 to 5.1 in 2012, while in
South-Asia TFR decreased from 4.2 to 2.6, and in Latin-America from 3.2 to 2.2 over the same
period [2]. While improving the access to contraceptives is necessary for reducing fertility
rates, it is not sufficient in countries where the demand for children remains high. For TFR to
drop, fertility preferences need to change; either through a socio-cultural evolution or through
socio-economic changes [5,6]. Economic growth and modernization of society are generally as-
sociated with TFR decreases—although there is some recent evidence that beyond certain levels
of development, fertility rates increase again [7]—but it is not completely understood why and
how [8–10].

In this paper we assess how fertility changes with increased labor market participation of

women. Female employment affects fertility through three main channels: 1/ an income effect,
2/ a substitution effect, and 3/ an empowerment effect [11,12]. First, female employment con-
tributes to total household income, and additional income can be invested in raising more chil-
dren or in improving childcare quality. This income effect can lead to increased or reduced
fertility, but generally fertility drops if income rises [13]. Second, employed women have a
higher opportunity cost of raising children, and substitute productive labor for reproductive
labor. This substitution effect results in decreased fertility. Third, working outside the household
and earning an own income empowers women. If women have lower-fertility preferences than
men—which has been documented to be the case for SSA [14]—women’s empowerment within
the household will reduce fertility rates. Through employment women widen their social net-
work, which can lower fertility preferences and increase knowledge about birth control [15].
The empirical relation between female employment and fertility has been documented for
high-income countries, mainly through cross-country studies (e.g. [16,17]). Micro-economic
studies and empirical evidence from developing countries, and especially from rural areas, are
extremely scarce. Lower individual fertility due to employment of women has been documented
for the Netherlands [18], United States of America [19], China [20] and urban areas in SSA
[21,22]. Micro-economic evidence is needed to further elucidate whether female employment
and fertility decreases are part of a cultural evolution or whether an economic revolution in fe-
male employment can trigger fertility decreases. Evidence from low-income countries is impor-
tant because effects may differ in a setting of early and slow demographic transition, as in many
countries in SSA [8,9]. Effects may differ because the cost of raising children is low, social securi-
ty is largely absent, reproductive norms are different and female empowerment is low.

In this paper we analyze the effect of female employment on fertility in the Saint-Louis re-
gion in Senegal. This is a relevant case for two reasons. First, Senegal has a TFR of 5.0, which is
one of the highest in the world [2]. The transition towards lower fertility started in Senegal, in
the early 1970s in urban areas and the late 1980s in rural areas, but is particularly slow [23].
The Senegalese government is investing in family planning programs, especially targeting rural
areas, with the aim of increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate to 27% by 2015 [24]. Our re-
sults can inform such policy to render programs more successful by directing them to regions
where women have lower-fertility preferences. Second, female employment in the Saint-Louis
region increased rapidly since 2005 as a result of a horticultural export boom. Increased invest-
ments in the horticultural export sector created employment opportunities for rural women
while these women hardly participated in the labor market before the boom [25]. This

represents an ideal case to study how fertility changes with increased female employment in a
poor, rural area.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
We use data from a socioeconomic survey of rural households in Senegal. Households were
chosen randomly from a list of households at the community level. The respondents were
heads of households and their wives; no minors were interviewed. Respondents participated in
the survey voluntarily, based on verbal consent. The purpose of the study was clearly explained
to each respondent and based on that information respondents could choose to participate in
the survey or not. When respondents gave their consent, their names and contact details were
recorded by the enumerators. Written consent was not possible because a large share of the re-
spondents are illiterate and not familiar with formal paperwork. The survey was carried out
through face-to-face interviews in the local language. The interviews were implemented by
trained enumerators. The authors did not implement any face-to-face interviews themselves
but supervised the survey. The respondents provided information about all household mem-
bers, including minors. No health related questions were asked. We carefully ascertained that
respondents were not exposed to any risk or detriment during the survey. Data were analyzed
in a strictly anonymous way and only used for research purposes. This work was done in accor-
dance with the Helsinki Declaration. At the time the survey was designed and implemented,
the Social and Societal Committee of KU Leuven did not yet exist and KU Leuven did not re-
view socioeconomic survey research. Following completion of the study, we consulted Social
and Societal Committee, who advised: “[the researchers] have informed the commission in de-
tail about the research protocols and procedures that were involved in the study, and the com-
mission concluded that these protocols are largely consistent with the standards of ethical
research practices at our university.”

Research area
Our research area covers three rural communities (Gandon, Fass and Diama) in the Saint-
Louis region in the north of Senegal. This area was purposively chosen because it is one of the
main horticultural export regions. A multinational holding invested in this area in 2003 and
started to export cherry tomatoes in 2005. In the meantime the number of horticultural export
companies in the region increased to five, and the cultivated area and product variety are still
expanding. The five export companies are all located in the northern part of the area, north of
Saint Louis town and the N2 road to Ross Bethio. Availability of land and water from the Sene-
gal river are the main reasons for companies to establish in this area. In the southern area,
south of Saint Louis town and the N2, no horticultural exports have been realized yet but one
company already has a land lease deal in this area and is investing in irrigation infrastructure
to start export activities from 2016 onwards. The companies produce vegetables on land leased
from local rural communities, do post-harvest handling in their conditioning centers, and ex-
port produce to the EU; and rely on labor hired from the surrounding communities.

Data collection
Survey data were collected in one round in April-June 2013. A stratified random sample of 500
households, clustered in 34 villages, was drawn, and a quantitative structured questionnaire
was used. The survey provides household-level data on farm production, land and non-land as-
sets, and living conditions, and individual-level data on demographic characteristics,

employment history and off-farm earnings. Production and income data are collected for the
12 months period prior to the survey. Individual-level data are collected for all current house-
hold members (i.e. all persons who lived, slept and ate within the household compound during
at least six months in the 12 months period prior to the survey), and children of the household
head who already left the household. The sample of 500 households includes 1500 adult
women above the age of 18; including wives, daughters and in-laws of the household head who
live in the extended household. Data include the birth years for the surviving children of all
these women; including children who do not live in the household anymore. This allows us to
construct a detailed fertility history for these 1500 women. For the fertility analysis we only re-
tain women in the age range from 18 to 40 because 18 is the lower age limit for formal wage
employment and because we do not expect to see an impact for older women whose fertility de-
cisions were already taken before the export boom. In addition, we suspect that the quality of
the data on child birth years declines for older women. The final sample of women in the age
cohort 18–40 includes 997 women of which 185 are employed outside the household and the
household farm; the majority (66%) in horticultural export companies. While we only collected
cross-sectional data in one survey round, we can construct a panel database for a limited num-
ber of variables as the survey includes detailed data on women’s fertility history and on entry
into employment, and some other recall data. Additional data were collected from the sampled
villages, on geographical and institutional characteristics, and from the five export companies,
on production activities, sourcing strategies and working conditions. National export figures
are from the FAOSTAT database.

Employment and fertility calculations
We distinguish a northern area, north of Saint-Louis where the export companies are located,
and a southern area, south of Saint-Louis where no export companies are active yet. Female
employment rates for these two areas (Fig. 1a) are calculated as the share of women (aged
18–65 and able to work) employed in horticultural export companies in a particular year in the
period 2000–2012, based on recall questions about employment. Birth rates for the two areas
are calculated as the total number of children born in a specific year divided by the total num-
ber of fertile women (aged 15–49) in that year. The TFR is calculated for the two areas as the
sum of age-specific fertility rates for 5-year age cohorts (15–19, 20–24, up to 45–49) for the pe-
riod 2007–2012. We compare fertility, age at first marriage and age at first child birth for em-
ployed and non-employed women in specific age-cohorts. We categorize the 997 women aged
18–40 in the sample in four age cohorts: 18–24, 25–29, 30–34 and 35–40. Age-specific fertility
(Fig. 1b) is calculated as the average number of surviving children per woman for these age co-
horts and for employed and non-employed women. We use the number of surviving children
as fertility indicator rather than total number of live births, as is mostly done in economic stud-
ies [6]. We define employed women as women who participated in formal off-farm employ-
ment during the 12 months period prior to the survey (regardless of the length of that
employment). Age at first marriage (Fig. 1c) and age at first childbirth (Fig. 1d) are calculated
as average ages for the four age cohorts and for employed and non-employed women.

Causal identification
We hypothesize that female employment reduces fertility but causal identification of this effect
is difficult due to unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality. Potential underestimation of
the negative effect of female employment on fertility (or overestimation of the fertility-reducing
effect of employment) is a particular concern as this may lead to wrong conclusions. Unob-
served heterogeneity in social norms and in the initial empowerment of women may influence

the likelihood of women to be employed and their fertility in opposite directions. If more em-
powered women or women in less traditional communities have a higher probability to be em-
ployed and a lower fertility, we may underestimate the negative effect of female employment
on fertility (or overestimate the reduction in the number of children). Also reverse causality
may lead to underestimated effects if women with (more) children have a lower likelihood to
be employed [26]. Overestimation of the effect of female employment on fertility (or underesti-
mation of the fertility-reducing effect) is less likely but could occur, e.g. if poorer women have
more children and are more attracted to off-farm wage employment opportunities. We use
difference-in-differences (DD) estimation, combined with matching, and Poisson regression
models with village fixed effects and instrumental variables (IV) as strategy to reduce potential
bias. We combine these methods in order to exploit the strengths of each of them and reduce
potential bias to the extent possible and in order to check the robustness of the estimated ef-
fects. Randomized control trials (RCT) are sometimes put forward as the most credible causal
identification strategy but an RCT in which employment is randomized across the female

working-age population to measure the effects on fertility years later is not feasible and prone
to a ‘faux exogeneity’ claim [27].

Difference-in-Differences estimation. We use difference-in-differences (DD) estimation

to compare the number of surviving children per woman for employed/treated and non-
employed/control women before and after the treatment. We use 2005, the start of the horticul-
tural export boom when female employment was very low (Fig. 1a), as pre-treatment point
and 2013, the year of the survey when female employment was very high (Fig. 1a), as post-
treatment point. We use a balanced panel of the 997 women in the sample who were in the age
category 18–40 in 2013. We use the fertility history data to derive the number of children a
woman had in 2005, and recall data for other variable values in 2005. First, we estimate a sim-
ple DD model (Equation 1, DD) including a treatment variable (Ti: a dummy variable for
women being employed in 2013), a time variable (t: a dummy for the post-treatment year), and
the interaction between these two (Tit). Second, we estimate the DD model (Equation 2, DD
with covariates) with a set of observable time-varying and time-constant pre-treatment charac-
teristics Xi. The vector Xi includes women’s age, literacy, marital status, religion and ethnicity,
household land ownership and distance from the road in 2005. These variables might be corre-
lated with female employment and fertility and are included to increase consistency and effi-
ciency of the coefficient estimates. The coefficient β1 represents the time-invariant differences
between the treated and control group and the coefficient β2 represents the effect of going from
the pre-treatment year to the post-treatment year. Our main interest lies in the coefficient β3
that represents the DD estimator of the effect of female employment on fertility (Yi), as indicat-
ed in Equation 3.

Using the DD estimation, we are able to control for observable pre-treatment characteristics

with T treated and C control;

and for unobservable time-constant effects that might be correlated with both employment
and fertility. However, the estimated effect of female employment on fertility might still be bi-
ased if employed/treated and unemployed/control observations are not similar in unobservable
pre-treatment characteristics as treatment is not randomly assigned to women. We further
control for heterogeneity in initial conditions by combining the DD estimation with Propensity
Score Matching (PSM). We estimate a propensity score (PS) using the vector Xi, match em-
ployed and unemployed women on the PS using Kernel matching, derive the matching
weights, and use these weights in the DD estimation of the effect of employment on fertility
within the common support region. Balancing properties are tested (S4 Table) and treated and
control units are found to be similar in observable characteristics after matching. This ap-
proach resembles a quasi-experimental approach to create similarity in treated and control
units through matching.

The DD estimation does not solve the issue of time-varying unobservable characteristics

that are potentially correlated with female employment and fertility. An additional drawback is
that we can only include a limited number of variables in the DD estimation for which recall
information is available. Therefore, we combine this method with a cross-sectional Poisson re-
gression that allows us to include more observable characteristics and to use instrumental vari-
ables to reduce bias from reverse causality and unobserved heterogeneity.

Poisson regression. We estimate the effect of female employment on fertility using cross-
sectional regression analysis. As the number of children is a count variable, we assume a Pois-
son distribution of the dependent variable Yi with the mean μi an exponential function of a vec-
tor of covariates Xi. This vector includes our main variable of interest, a dummy variable for
female employment, and a large set of control variables at individual level (women’s age, litera-
cy, marital status, religion, ethnicity, and relation to the household head), household level (land
ownership, livestock ownership, poverty status, and age, gender and literacy of the household
head), and village level (distance from the road, presence of a female organization, and ethnic
composition). Poverty status is calculated according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index
(MPI) guidelines by the United Nations Development Program [28]. Households are consid-
ered to be poor if their MPI is higher than 0.33. These control variables capture observable
characteristics that are likely correlated with female employment and/or fertility. Additionally,
we include the number of children a woman had in 2005 to control for fertility preferences be-
fore the horticultural export boom and associated female employment started.

First, we estimate a standard Poisson regression with robust standard errors to correct for

over-dispersion (Poisson). Second, we additionally include village ﬁxed effects (Poisson Village
FE). If unobserved norms and attitudes towards female employment and fertility are commu-
nity-speciﬁc, village ﬁxed effects may control for some part of the unobserved heterogeneity.
Third, we apply a two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) or control-function approach to further
reduce the unobserved heterogeneity bias. A conventional two-stage least squares (2SLS) ap-
proach would lead to inconsistent estimates, because of the non-linearity of the Poisson model
[29]. The distance to the nearest horticultural export company is used as an instrument. This is
a relevant instrument as it has a large negative and signiﬁcant effect on female employment in
the ﬁrst stage regression (S6 Table)—which is related to an increased walking time women
need to reach the company. We argue for plausible exogeneity of the instrument as companies’
investment decisions are likely not related to women’s fertility decisions, but rather determined
by immediate access to land, water and labor. Therefore the correlation between the instrument
and unobserved differences in initial reproductive norms and female empowerment is likely
very low (albeit not completely zero). We ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient on the predicted residuals in
the second stage regression is insigniﬁcant (S5 Table), which is an indication that female em-
ployment is not endogenous. The insigniﬁcant effect of number of children in 2005 in the ﬁrst
stage regression (S6 Table) also points in this direction as it indicates that women’s fertility in
2005 did not inﬂuence the probability of employment and that reverse causality is not a major
issue. In this case, the coefﬁcient estimate for female employment in the 2SRI model is consis-
tent but less efﬁcient than the estimate of the standard Poisson regression. A Hausman test
comparing the standard Poisson and 2SRI regressions does not reject the null hypothesis that
the standard Poisson estimation is consistent and efﬁcient.

The efficiency and consistency of this Poisson and IV approach importantly depends on the
choice of the instrument. We argue for plausible exogeneity of the instrument but we acknowl-
edge that the instrument, the distance to the nearest horticultural company, is not perfect.
First, women with lower fertility preferences might move closer to the companies to access em-
ployment. This is not the case in our sample; only three women migrated after the companies
established, which we consider negligible. Second, the presence of companies might influence
fertility decisions through other channels than employment. Companies invest in infrastruc-
ture such as roads, school, and health centres as part of the land lease deals with the rural

communities. This may affect fertility decisions irrespective of employment in the companies.
Such effects are more indirect and likely less strong but could lead to an overestimation of the
negative effect of employment on fertility (or an underestimation of the fertility-reducing effect
of employment). However, these effects are at least partially captured by the variable ‘distance
to concrete road’ in the Poisson regression model. Third, by choosing a location based on ac-
cess to land, water and labor, companies might settle in areas with particular fertility rates.
Companies may prefer to settle closer to the Senegal river, where villages could be more pros-
perous because of easy access to water; and this prosperity might have effected fertility deci-
sions in the past. Companies may prefer to settle in villages with abundant labor resources; and
this abundance might be related to high fertility rates in the past. Companies may settle in vil-
lages with stronger leadership because these villages are stronger in the negotiation process
with the companies; and this may be related to different cultural fertility norms. Such unob-
served effects may lead to some remaining bias in our estimates. However, these effects are at
least partially captured by the variable ‘number of children in 2005’ in the Poisson regression
model. Because of the difficulty to find a perfect instrument, we combine this method with the
above described DD approach that does not depend on instruments but on recall information.

Results
Horticultural exports and female employment
Horticultural exports from Senegal increased from 5 million USD in 2003 to 45 million in
2011. The five export companies in the region Saint-Louis in the north of Senegal account for a
major share of these exports. The increase in horticultural exports have created approximately
5,000 jobs in the region, of which 80% are occupied by women. The employees are mainly un-
skilled workers from the surrounding villages. The majority is hired as daily or seasonal worker;
either as field worker for harvesting or as factory worker for washing, sorting and packing of
produce. In the communities north of Saint Louis town (northern area), where the export com-
panies are located because of easy access to irrigation water from the Senegal river, the share of
women who are wage employed in the horticultural export sector increased from virtually zero
in the early years 2000 to more than 20% in 2013 (Fig. 1a). In the neighboring communities
south of Saint Louis town (southern area), where new investments in irrigation infrastructure
and export companies are planned but not executed yet, there is a much smaller (only 3% in
2013) increase in the share of wage employed women (Fig. 1a). This can be explained by a larg-
er distance to the companies, resulting in substantially more time needed for potential workers
to reach the companies by foot. The road network density in the area is low and most people
do not have any other means of transport. In addition, rural communities negotiated for pref-
erential sourcing of labor from their own communities in the land lease deals with
the companies.

From the 500 households that were surveyed, 132 have women that are employed for a

wage outside the household and the family farm. The total income in these households is about
20% higher than in households without female employment (S1 Table). The wages of employed
women contribute on average 23% to the total income of these households. These wages mainly
(75%) come from the horticultural export industry but some women have other jobs (mainly
domestic workers, hairdressers and garment-workers in Saint Louis town). In our sample,
women are employed on average 6.7 months per year and 71% is employed for at least six
months per year. Eighty-three percent of the employed women have a daily or seasonal con-
tract while 17% have a yearly or permanent contract. During the employment period, women
work nearly full-time with an average of 37 hours per week. Most employed women never
worked outside the household and the family farm before their employment in export

companies. Apart from wage employment, households obtain income from farming and small
off-farm businesses. There are some differences between employed and non-employed women
in observable individual, household and village characteristics (S2 Table). When analyzing the
probability of women to be employed (S6 Table), we find the highest probability for ethnic
non-Wolof, unmarried women around the age of 25 who live with their parents. Women in vil-
lages closer to the export companies and to the road network, and in villages with a single eth-
nicity and presence of female associations also have a higher probability of being employed.
Women’s education and household asset ownership do not affect the likelihood
of employment.

Female employment and fertility
While female employment increased over time, fertility decreased. The number of births per
woman was similar in the two areas in 2005 (0.15 for the northern area and 0.14 for the south-
ern area) but decreased more sharply in the northern area (to 0.08 in 2013, compared to 0.11
for the southern area) where female employment increased most. The TFR, calculated as the
sum of age-specific fertility rates for 5 year age cohorts for the period 2007–2012, is lower for
the northern area (3.08) than for the southern area (3.61). It is difficult to compare the TFR cal-
culations with the national TFR of 5.0 in Senegal, as they are based on a small number of obser-
vations and take only surviving children into account. Regional differences in TFR within the
country likely exist but are not documented in secondary data. It is likely that the TFR in the
Saint-Louis region is comparatively low, as it is a rather developed and less remote region. Yet,
the difference in the calculated TFR between the two regions is an indication of true differences
in fertility because they are calculated in the same way. The number of surviving children of
employed women is substantially below that of unemployed women for age cohorts between
25 and 40 (Fig. 1b). Age at first marriage and age at first childbirth is higher for employed
women than for unemployed women in the age cohorts 25–29 and 30–34 (Figs. 1c and 1d). For
the age cohorts 18–24 and 35–40, there are no substantial differences in age at marriage and
age at first childbirth between employed and unemployed women, likely because only a small
share of the youngest women are married and have children and because the oldest women al-
ready had children before they started employment. By postponing marriage and first child-
birth, employed women reduce the child-bearing years and the window of biological
opportunity for subsequent children.

The results from the difference-in-differences (DD) estimation and the Poisson regression
models can give us more insights into whether and to what extent the observed differences in
fertility between employed and unemployed women can be attributed to the effect of female
employment. The estimation results show that female employment significantly decreases the
number of children, with point estimates varying between -0.22 to -0.33 (Table 1). The point
estimates and estimated standard errors from the different models are quite similar, implying
robust results. The IV approach results in similar point estimates but large standard errors,
which is in line with consistent but less efficient estimates.

As the research area has a high prevalence of illiteracy (65% of women, S2 Table) and pover-

ty (63% of households, S2 Table), we analyze how the effect of female employment on fertility
changes with women’s education and with households’ poverty by including interaction terms
in the cross-sectional Poisson model (Table 2). Illiterate women have significantly more chil-
dren but the fertility-reducing effect of female employment is stronger for illiterate women.
Employment reduces the number of children with 0.423 (or 23%) for illiterate women but has
no effect for literate women. Women in poorer households have more children but the fertility

reducing effect of female employment is as strong for women in poor households as for women
in non-poor households.

Other drivers of lower fertility
Apart from the employment status of women, other factors influence fertility as well, as can be
revealed from the full regression results (S3 and S5 Tables). Older women, married women and
Muslim women are found to have more children. Ethnicity has no significant effect on fertility.

or an older head of household have more children. Ownership of land and livestock, the main
productive assets in the area, does not influence fertility. As already indicated above, women’s
literacy promotes lower fertility while poverty increases fertility.

Discussion and Conclusions
We find that female employment reduces the number of children per woman with 0.22 to 0.33.
This is lower than the effects found for the Netherlands [18], China [20] and Kinshasa [21] but
nevertheless still quite large. Relative to the sample average of 1.34 children per woman in the
age category 18 to 40, this is a reduction of 16% to 25%. The effect is estimated only 8 years
after rural women in the Saint Louis region faced a sudden opportunity for off-farm employ-
ment. For a substantial share of women considered in the analysis, fertility decisions were
largely already taken when employment opportunities arose. If female employment persists or
expands in the region, fertility is likely to reduce further if women are employed for a longer
period and if younger women are employed before fertility decisions are taken.

We find that poverty and illiteracy increase the number of children per woman. This is in

line with previous findings in the literature [21,30], and with the demographic-economic para-
dox of an inverse correlation between fertility and wealth [13]. We find a negative effect of fe-
male employment on fertility, when poverty and wealth are controlled for. This suggests that
the fertility-reducing effect of female employment is not merely driven by an income effect. We
find that the fertility-reducing effect of female employment is as strong for poor women as for
non-poor women and stronger for illiterate women than for literate women. This points to the
importance of a female empowerment effect. The results imply that employment is a strong in-
strument to empower poor and illiterate women.

Previous research has indicated that female employment in the horticultural export sector
in Senegal increases the likelihood of primary-school-aged children, boys as well as girls, to be
in school [31]. Combined with our results, this implies that female employment leads to invest-
ment in the quality of childcare rather than the quantity of children. This may lead to reinforc-
ing effects in the long run. If female employment lowers fertility and increases girls’ education,
and if women’s education is associated with reduced fertility, the effect may persist in the long
run (even if exports and associated employment opportunities would stall) because daughters
of employed women will be better educated and will have low-fertility preferences.

We provide evidence for a fertility-reducing effect of female employment in rural Senegal.
Evidence for this link in rural areas of developing countries is non-existent but highly relevant
given the high TFR in developing countries, SSA in particular, and the beneficial development
effects associated with reduced fertility. Our results imply that employment in rural areas can
be an important instrument for empowering women, reducing fertility and accelerating the de-
mographic transition in poor countries. Our analysis contributes to the discussion on whether
low-fertility preferences are the result of (collective) cultural or (individual) economic driving
factors [6]. Our analysis is done at the micro-economic level, with individual women as unit of
observation, and our results imply that fertility decreases (quite rapidly) through individual-
specific economic changes. It is not unconceivable that female employment and its fertility-
reducing effect at individual level, result in changes in reproductive norms in society and a
(slower) cultural evolution towards low-fertility preferences. We did not address this issue as it
requires a longer term perspective and a different analytical approach.

Our results are specific for the case-study region in Senegal. The fertility-reducing effect
of female employment is likely impinged on by culture; which calls for caution in generaliz-
ing our results. Our research area has a high prevalence of polygamy and extended families
living in compounds—which is to some extent characteristic for Western Africa but not for

the rest of SSA. On the one hand, such a situation might ease female employment because
there is less conflict between productive and reproductive tasks of women in the extended
household—in our sample women from the same household are observed to take turns in
working in export companies for a wage and staying home for reproductive tasks. The
fertility-reducing effect of female employment might be rather modest in this case because
labor substitution effects are less important. On the other hand, the empowerment of women
in more traditional, extended and polygamist households is low [32]. A low initial bargaining
power in the household might impede women to participate in off-farm employment but
when they do, this employment might have a large effect on their autonomy. The fertility-
reducing effect of female employment might be rather strong in this case because of a large
empowerment effect.

The booming horticultural export sector represents the major source of off-farm wage em-
ployment for women in our study region. Our results imply that horticultural exports indirect-
ly, through creating jobs accessible for women, contribute to a reduction in fertility rates. There
is a large literature on the link between trade and development in general [33], and on the con-
tribution of high-value food exports in particular [34], and a rising consensus that trade is
good for development. Our findings corroborate this and add evidence for important indirect
and non-monetary development effects of international trade and globalization.

Our findings have important policy implications. Many developing countries invest in fami-
ly planning programs to slowdown population growth. While female employment contributes
to reducing fertility by lowering fertility preferences, fertility may drop further if women who
prefer fewer children are better aware of family planning methods and have better access to
contraceptives. Family planning programs might therefore be more efficient and effective if tar-
geted to areas with higher female labor participation rates or to employed women directly. Our
results imply that employment in rural areas can have multiple and reinforcing effects on de-
velopment. This calls for a recognition of the importance of labor markets, also in rural areas,
in contemporary development thinking and policy.
