1. Introduction  

The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB1) is a global initiative focused on drawing attention 
to the economic benefits of biodiversity including the growing cost of biodiversity loss and ecosystem 
degradation.  TEEB  presents  an  approach  that  can  help  decision-makers  recognize,  demonstrate  and 
capture the values of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Within the global initiative, studies have been 
undertaken to investigate the application of the concept to different sectors.  The ‘TEEB for Agriculture 
and  Food’  (TEEBAgriFood 2)  study  seeks  to  review  the  economic  interdependencies  between  human 
(economic and social) systems, agriculture and food systems, and biodiversity and ecosystems. In doing 
so, it addresses the economic invisibility of many of these links while exploring how biodiversity and key 
ecosystem  services  deliver  benefits  to  the  agriculture  sector  and also  beyond,  itself  being  a  key 
contributor to human health, livelihoods and well-being. 
 
The first major output of TEEBAgriFood is a ‘Scientific and Economic Foundations’ report3, which addresses 
the core theoretical issues and controversies underpinning the evaluation of the nexus between the agri-
food sector, biodiversity and ecosystem services and externalities including human health impacts from 
agriculture on a global scale. As part of this research, authors have developed an Evaluation Framework4 
that provides broad categories of all interactions that may exist within a given ‘eco-agri-food system’. 
 
The  overall  purpose  of  the  Framework  is  to  provide  a  clear  and  common  starting  point  for  future 
assessments  that  seek  to  carry  out  holistic  evaluations  in  line  with  the  systems  view  advocated  by 
TEEBAgriFood. These ‘Framework-testing studies’ will generally have the following features: 

•  broad and systemic in nature,  
• 
•  examine connections along the full value chain, including production, processing & manufacturing, 

reflect the contributions of all four capitals (natural, produced, human and social), and 

distribution, marketing & retail, and consumption. 
 

The TEEB Secretariat has invited reports on regional narratives and perspectives on the relevance and 
application of the TEEBAgriFood Framework to the agriculture and food sector in Africa. 

Objectives and aims of this study 

This  study  has  been  carried  out  to  contribute  to  the  further  development  and  refinement  of  the 
Framework, through the lens of farming approaches to rice in Senegal. It has been formulated to explore 
the  agricultural  policy  landscape  in  the  region,  and  in  particular  the  extent  to  which  these  policies 
influence the way in which inter alia ecosystems and biodiversity, livelihoods and equity, and nutrition 
and health are captured.

The specific aim has been to set out an approach to assess the various types of interventions in 
the agriculture and food sector of rice production in Senegal that might be used to capture these 
values so that hitherto invisible value-additions are recognized and accounted for in decision-
making, leading to better livelihood outcomes.  The study utilized an approach based on first, 
stakeholder consultation to develop a robust understanding of the issues facing rice production, 
and second, a systems model simulation to compare the outcomes- many of which otherwise 
remain invisible – on the Sustainable Development goals relevant to livelihoods in Senegal. 
 
Development of the discourse on rice production issues in Senegal 

Agriculture is central to the economy of Senegal; 70% of the population work in the agriculture 
sectors, contributing 17% to overall GDP.  Almost half of the land in Senegal is under agriculture, 
although much of this is in extensive livestock grazing.  Only 17% of the land area of Senegal is 
arable  (FAOSTAT,  no  date).    Agriculture  in  Senegal  is  dominated  by  very  small  family  farms, 
occupying  95%  of  the  country’s  agricultural  land,  and  representing  80%  of  the  population.  
Ranked  164th  out  of  189  countries  on  the  Human  Development  Index  (HDI)  in  2017,  food 
insecurity remains a constant concern in Senegal. The two largest crops by production value in 
Senegal are cash crops, sugar cane and groundnuts.  The third largest is rice (FAOSTAT 2018). 

Ensuring and improving food security is a high priority for the Senegal government, as national 
food  production  does  not  meet  Senegal's  needs.  The  production  of  major  staple  food  crops 
covers barely 30% of consumption needs, with the remaining 70% being imported- mostly rice, 
wheat and maize.  This dependence on global markets exposes households to price fluctuations 
and greater vulnerability. 
 
Agriculture  in  Senegal  is  negatively  impacted  by  land  access  problems,  deterioration  of  soils, 
forests and water resources (in quality and quantity), and  the high use of pesticides (DYTAES, 
2019). In recent years, groundnut yields have begun to decrease due to a combination of poor 
soil conditions and climatic factors; yields in 2018 were 5% lower than in 2015 (FAOSTAT). 
 
There has been a long history of efforts to identify alternative agricultural pathways in Senegal 
marked  by  multiple  local  initiatives  on  the  part  of  NGOs,  farmer  organizations,  some  private 
sector partners, and also through national level platforms (FAO and Biovision, in draft).  Actions 
have  focused  on  integrated  and  sustainable  land  management,  water  and  soil  conservation 
practices, crop associations, biological control of plant pests, organic conservation methods for 
agricultural products and agroforestry.  In particular, a growing focus on agroecology as a viable 
alternative has arisen on several levels:

• 

the socio-economic level (consumer awareness on products’ origin, promotion of healthy 
food and enhancing local economy through short circuits markets);  
the environmental level (promotion of organic fertilizers, biocides);  

• 
•  and at the political level (public authorities have manifested their interest in agroecology, 

as part of the political discourse and agenda) (FAO and Biovision, in draft)  

 
Notably,  in  2019  the  Senegalese  government  placed  agroecological  transition  among  the  five 
major initiatives of the Priority Action Plan of the second phase of the Plan Senegal Emergent 
Vert  (2019-2024),  the  key  national  policy  framework.  Also  in  2019,  a  coalition  -  called  “la 
Dynamique sur la Transition Agroécologique_au_Sénégal” (DyTAES) - of producer organizations, 
civil society organisations, researchers, consumers, local authorities and sectoral ministries was 
created as an umbrella initiative to support the government’s commitment and to move towards 
an effective agroecological transition.  
 
Given  the  ongoing  dialogue  taking  place  in  Senegal  on  the  shape  and  form  of  agricultural 
development, particularly as it pertains to the most important crop from the standpoint of food 
security  –  rice  –  it  seems  highly  appropriate  to  focus  a  study,  applying  the  TEEBAgriFood 
framework  on  rice  value  chains,  comparing  alternative  development  pathways  between 
agroecological approaches and “business as usual”. 

 
Role of rice in the agriculture sector of Senegal 

Rice is the most consumed cereal in Senegal and a critically important staple food crop (Colen et 
al. 2013). In 2009, the average consumption of rice was 71.5 kilogram per person per year, which 
results in a total consumption of 984,000 tons of rice per year (Maclean et al. 2013). Senegal is 
one  of the  largest  consumers  of  rice  in  West-Africa  (Maclean  et  al.  2013).  However,  as  noted 
above, a considerable portion of rice comes from imports, estimated at around 80 percent in 
2005 to provide the needed quantities for domestic consumption  though possibly declining more 
recently to  around  60% (USDA  2017).  In  any  case,  this  makes  Senegal  the  second  largest  rice 
importer in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) (Brüntrup et al. 2006), and also makes Senegal one of the 
largest net importers of food in the world (Stads & Sene 2011). Figure 1 shows the rice import 
and production trend from 1999 to 2016, with import exceeding production in each year. Self-
sufficiency in production is a goal and a challenge for the Government of Senegal.

Figure 1. Rice imports and production, Senegal (FAOSTAT) 

 
Rice has long been a valued crop in Senegal, with increasing importance over the last decades.  
Since the 1980s, the country has emphasized rice production through subsidies, extension, and 
infrastructure, but has failed to compete commercially with imported rice (Dermont & Rizzotto 
2012).  This  is  partly due  to the  government’s  focus  on urban  populations  and their  efforts to 
import cheap rice from Asia (Khouma et al. 2012), which considerably undercuts local production. 
 
About 20 percent of the total area of Senegal is arable land of which rice production occurs on 
about five percent in 2010 (Maclean et al. 2013). The area of rice cultivation in Senegal almost 
doubled from 86,252 hectares in the year 2000 to 135,129 hectares in 2012. But not only the 
area of rice cultivation increased in Senegal - the amount of rice production augmented three-
fold from 2000 to 2012. In 2012 paddy rice production on a national level was 630,654 tons, while 
in 2000 this was 202,293 tons (FAOSTAT, n.d.). This means that the average yield almost doubled 
from 2.34 tons per hectare in 2000 to 4.67 tons per hectare in 2012, although it has declined to 
4.21 in 2017. Senegal is recognized for having one of the largest production increases, from 2010 
to  2017  in  West  Africa,  along  with  Benin  and  Côte  d’Ivoire.  Although  overall  regional  rice 
production increased by 25% from 2010 to 2017, rice consumption was up by 35%, a more rapid 
increase than expected.  As a consequence, regional self-sufficiency declined from 59% to 54%.  
Senegal is one of four countries, over this time, that has increased its rice self-sufficiency (by 4%) 
(Styger & Traoré 2018).

Figure 2. Area harvested, yields and national production trends of paddy rice in Senegal, 1990-
2017 (FAOSTAT) 
 
Yet, according to Maclean et al. (2013), average yields varied widely over the past twenty years 
(Figure 2). In irrigated systems, the potential yield is nine tons per hectare in the wet season and 
12 tons per hectare  in  the  dry  season,  indicating  a  pronounced  yield  gap between  actual  and 
potential  yield  in  Senegal  (Wopereis  et  al.,  1999),  which  could  be  addressed  with  different 
management practices. Since 2007, rice harvested area has increased dramatically by expansion 
of dry-season rice cropping in the Senegal River valley. The average on-farm yields are reaching 
5.4 tons per hectare in the wet season and 6.8 tons per hectare in the dry season (Saito et al., 
2015). 
 
Rice consumption in sub Saharan Africa has been growing rapidly (Diagne 2010). It is a staple that 
takes less time and energy to prepare than other staples such as cassava and bananas.  These are 
important considerations as women are participating increasingly in the labor market.  Rice has 
a long shelf live and is relatively easy to store and handle, of great utility as urban household 

 

12 

members are consuming food increasingly away from home. At the same time, rice production 
is seen as a source of greenhouse gases due to its methane emissions, and as larger user of water 
resources, with considerable evaporative water losses 
 
Thus,  there  are  strong  imperatives  facing  the  rice  sector  in  Senegal:  to  increase  domestic 
production  and  processing  of  rice,  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Several  substantial  donors  have 
proposed  that  investments  should  be  made  in  large  scale  rice  production  and  processing.  
However, there are a number of alternative pathways to that goal.  For example, increasing rice 
production by conventional high-input methods could ramp up yields, but there are increased 
costs related to greater fertilizer, pesticide and water use.  Large-scale rice value chain projects 
may propose equally large rice mills, but the opportunity to process rice in smaller units may 
enable  greater  use  of  rice  by-products  such  as  for  livestock  feed  and  promote  greater  equity 
through community ownership.  Different pathways have different implications for employment 
in the agriculture and food sector. By using a holistic framework to review the possible pathways, 
many diverse aspects can be brought into focus at the same time, looking at impacts on not just 
economic/produced capital but also social, human and natural.

2. Dimensions of rice beyond yields 
 
The contribution and impacts of rice – like any and all agricultural products - to the livelihoods of 
people has far greater significance to human (and the earth’s) welfare than is captured by yields 
or production statistics alone.  We introduce a few of these considerations here, but they are as 
well the overall focus of this report. 
 
Rice  is  produced  around  the  world  by  millions  of  small-scale  family  farmers,  often  through 
complex social relationships.  The act of growing rice remains, in most countries, labour-intensive, 
with “green infrastructure” built and maintained by generations of farmers, working together.  
Rice paddies, sculpting the land, often serve as a form of water storage and supply and erosion 
control.  Water supply for rice comes from rivers and streams; irrigation flows through the same 
ancient river ways.  Flooded fields provide an environment that controls weeds, but the water is 
not then entirely used or transpired by the rice crop, nor is it all evaporated.  Water is let out of 
the field during the growing season, adding it back to downstream flows; thus, rice crops are not 
nearly as water-consuming as they are often perceived to be (Bouman 2009; Mutters,n.d.). 
 
With its long history of cultivation and selection under diverse environments, rice has acquired a 
wide adaptability enabling it to grow in a range of environments, from deep water to swamps, 
irrigated and wetland conditions, as well as on dry hill slopes. Probably far more than any other 
crop,  rice  can  grow  under  diverse  geographical,  climatic  and  cultural  conditions.  The  quality 
preferences  of  rice  consumers,  over  millennia,  have  resulted  in  a  wide  diversity  of  varieties 
specific to different localities.  Rice has a unique center of origin in West Africa, for the African 
rice  species  (Oryza  glabberrima).  According  to  Cubry  et  al  (2018),  the  Oryza  glabberrima  was 
domesticated in the inner Niger Delta.  This Africa rice species has been partly replaced by higher-
yielding Asian rice, but it nonetheless persists, particularly in upland environments. African rice 
is hardy and pest-resistant crop, well adapted to a variety of African conditions (Linares 2002) 
and often preferred for its nutty taste. African rice holds unique cultural values; for instance, it is 
sacred to the Jola people in the Casamance region of Senegal5, and is a heritage variety in the 
United States, having been brought to the New World by slaves (Carney 2009). The genetic traits 
of African rice have been used in breeding programs to develop NERICA, the “New Rice for Africa” 
(Sarla et al. 2005).   
 
When irrigated rice is grown under organic conditions, it creates its own “agricultural ecosystem 
of unrivaled complexity” (Settle et al. 1996). Underlying the seemingly simple structure of the 

5 According to Davidson (2015) Jola people have long depended on rice, and believe that their hard work in the rice paddies is part of a 
covenant with their supreme deity for which they are rewarded with rain

rice paddy monoculture, in smallholder and family farmer fields systems, is a complex system of 
built-in natural controls. Food web interactions among insect pests of rice and their numerous 
natural  enemies  in  paddy  fields  –  in  the  absence  of  high  pesticide  applications  -  can  be  very 
complex, often resulting in low but stable insect populations. In most early-season tropical rice 
fields, abundant populations of generalist predators can be found in (Settle et al. 1996). These 
generalist  predators  are  likely  to  be  supported,  in  the  early  season,  by  feeding  on  abundant 
populations of detritus- feeding  and  plankton-feeding  insects,  whose populations  consistently 
peak  and  decline  in  the first  third  of  the  season.  The  abundance  of  alternative  prey  gives  the 
predator populations a "head start" on later-developing pest populations, thus enabling them to 
strongly suppress pest populations and generally lend stability to rice ecosystems by decoupling 
predator  populations  from  a  strict  dependence  on  herbivore  populations.    These  and  other 
observations support management strategies that promote the conservation of existing natural 
biological control through a major reduction in insecticide use, and the corresponding increase 
in habitat heterogeneity. 
 
Rice fields harbour a surprisingly rich level of biodiversity, thought to be amongst the greatest of 
any tropical rainfed system (Halwart & Gupta 2004).  Around 600 or more species of organisms 
–  from  insects,  fish,  reptiles  and  amphibians  –  have  been  recorded  in  rice  fields  in  Thailand, 
Cambodia and Indonesia (Halwart & Gupta 2004; Gregory and Guttman 1996; Settle et al. 1996), 
although  similar  studies  have  not  been  carried  out  in  Senegal.  Since  rice  is  typically  grown  in 
flooded  conditions,  rice  fields  often  function  as  surrogate  ecosystems  for  wetland-dependent 
bird species.   
 
When  paddy  rice  is  cultivated  without  heavy  inputs  of  agricultural  chemicals,  it  is  possible  to 
integrate fish or duck rearing along with the rice. In a careful review of the literature, Halwart & 
Gupta  (2004)  documented  fish  production  yields  in  rice-fish  systems  all  over  the  world.  The 
analysis  demonstrates  that,  although  higher  rice  yields  were  not  always  obtained  with  the 
introduction of fish, the majority (80%) resulted in higher yields of 2.5% or more, and a significant 
contribution of fish protein to farmers’ diets.  Efforts to integrate fish with rice in the Casamance 
region of Senegal have shown considerable promise (Petersen et al. 2006). 
 
Rice consumption in sub Saharan Africa has been growing rapidly (Diagne 2010). It is a staple that 
takes less time and energy to prepare than other staples such as cassava and bananas.  These are 
important considerations as women are participating increasingly in the labor market.  Rice has 
a long shelf live and is relatively easy to store and handle, of great utility as urban household 
members are consuming food increasingly away from home.

Thus,  there  are  strong  imperatives  facing  the  rice  sector  in  Senegal:  to  increase  domestic 
production and processing of rice.   Several substantial donors have proposed that investment 
should  be  made  in  However,  there  are  a  number  of  alternative  pathways  to  that  goal.    For 
example, increasing rice production by conventional high-input methods could ramp up yields, 
but there are increased costs related to greater fertilizer, pesticide and water use.  Large-scale 
rice value chain projects may propose equally large rice mills, but the opportunity to process rice 
in smaller units may enable greater use of rice by-products such as for livestock feed and promote 
greater equity through community ownership.  Different pathways have different implications 
for employment in the agriculture and food sector. By using a holistic framework to review the 
possible pathways, many diverse aspects can be brought into focus at the same time, looking at 
impacts on not just economic/produced capital but also social, human and natural. 
 
As we pursued the methodology outlined below, the alternative pathway of agroecology was the 
most often invoked by stakeholders and the literature.  To clarify what is meant, we follow the 
definition  as  provided  by  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the United  Nations  (FAO): 
“Agroecology is  the  science  of  applying  ecological  concepts  and  principles  to  manage 
interactions  between  plants,  animals,  humans  and  the  environment  for  food  security  and 
nutrition. All over the world farmers already apply this approach, which has a fundamental pillar 
in traditional and local knowledge.” (http://www.fao.org/agroecology/knowledge/practices/en/)

3. Application of the TEEBAgriFood Framework 
 
“The  Economics  of  Ecosystems  and  Biodiversity  for  Agriculture  and  Food”  (TEEBAgriFood) 
initiative  (http://www.teebweb.org) seeks to review the economic interdependencies between 
human  (economic  and  social)  systems,  agriculture  and  food  systems,  and  biodiversity  and 
ecosystems.  TEEBAgriFood  has developed a  framework  supporting the evaluation  of  different 
agri-food systems across the food value chain, from production through consumption. In contrast 
to  the  commonly  used  metrics  such  as  levels  of  productivity,  the  TEEBAgriFood  Evaluation 
Framework  supports  a  broad  scope  of  evaluation,  across  human,  social,  economic  and 
environmental dimensions. The use of the Framework is advocated to recognize the key elements 
that should be evaluated in any given assessment, and to ensure transparency by highlighting the 
aspects that should not be overlooked. The Framework is intended to be used in an open and 
transdisciplinary manner, where questions, options and relevant variables are all determined in 
participatory manner. 
 
The initiative acknowledges that agriculture and the way agricultural production is performed 
affects all areas of development and itself is affected by those areas. Thus, a dynamic approach 
is  proposed,  particularly  seeking  to  reveal  the  invisible,  non-market  stocks  and  flows  through 
agricultural food value chains and their impacts and interdependencies. 
 
Steps undertaken in this TEEBAgriFood application to rice in Senegal 

The TEEB Foundations study proposed five key families of application for the TEEB framework: 
agricultural management systems, business analysis, dietary comparison, policy evaluation 
and national accounts for the agriculture and food sector. This particular contribution focuses on 
the  agricultural  management  system  of  rice  in  Senegal,  but  also  considers  the  implication  of 
different national policies relevant to rice management. 
 
As per the guidance provided in Chapter Six of the TEEB Foundations Report, we outline the key 
steps undertaken in this study, and where more information about each can be found. 
 

Steps 
Purpose of evaluation 

 
As stated in the objectives, this study is 
intended to contribute to the further 
development and refinement of the 
Framework, through the lens of farming 
approaches to rice in Senegal.   It explores 
the extent to which agricultural management 
approaches and policies influence the way in

which inter alia ecosystems and biodiversity, 
livelihoods and equity, and nutrition and 
health are captured, and all values may be 
captured and accounted for in decision-
making, leading to better livelihood 
outcomes.   
The entry point is rice production and value 
chains in Senegal, including all forms of rice 
cultivation, from non-irrigated upland rice to 
lowland paddy rice.  The spatial scale is 
throughout the rice growing regions of 
Senegal, as detailed in Table 1. 
The rice value chain, from production, 
processing, distribution and consumption is 
covered. 
Figure 7 presents the comprehensive set of 
stocks and flows within the rice sector of 
Senegal, and the modeled impacts on key 
indicators of the four capitals:  natural, 
human, produced and social.  Annex 3 
provides indication of where impacts and 
dependencies have been identified in rice 
production systems. 
A broad scope of evaluation is used, across 
human, social, economic and environmental 
dimensions. The impact of implementing a 
coherent set of policy responses on several 
relevant development outcomes in Senegal is 
analyzed through a system dynamics model. 
The study utilized an approach based on first, 
stakeholder consultation to develop a robust 
understanding of the issues facing rice 
production.  Data relevant to each of these 
issues was collected via literature reviews 
and expert knowledge, and used to fine tune 
a systems model simulation to compare the 
outcomes of two contrasting agricultural 
management and policies.  Many of the 
outcomes on the Sustainable Development 
goals relevant to livelihoods in Senegal, 
uncovered through this process, are ones 
which otherwise remain invisible – such as

unemployment rates and under 5 mortality 
rates. 
The results of the simulated agroecological 
scenarios indicate significant possible 
improvements by 2050 in all selected SDG 
indicators, linked to the four dimensions of 
capital, when compared by to “business as 
usual”. The results illustrate the interlinked 
nature of the system and reveal that the 
changes implemented in agriculture spread 
and diffuse through the whole system. 
Improvements in the agroecological scenario 
with respect to several indicators increase 
over time due to the reinforcing action of a 
set of positive feedback loops. The value of 
such a comprehensive, long-term analysis, 
and a holistic impact assessment that reviews 
the interdependencies between different 
dimensions of capital is highlighted, 
reinforcing the aims of the TEEB AgriFood 
initiative. 

 
In applying the framework, it has been possible to build off two in-depth, existing studies which 
have provided a basis of data and a structure for understanding the interactions between key 
variables in the TEEBAgriFood Framework. As a feeder study for the TEEBAgriFood initiative, an 
intensive study of positive and negative externalities in the Philippines, Cambodia, Senegal, Costa 
Rica  and  California  were  documented  (Bogdanski  et  al.  2016;  TEEB  AgriFood  2016),  which 
identified  and  documented  benefits  and  costs  of  rice  production  systems,  across  multiple 
dimensions.   
 
The TEEBAgriFood Economic and Scientific Foundations report makes a strong case that systems 
thinking  should  be  a  guiding  principle  in  the  application  its  Evaluation  Framework.  The 
Millennium Institute has been carrying out work with the government of Senegal to develop a 
systems  dynamics-based  model  to  support  national  development  planning  around  the 
Sustainable Development Goals, structured to analyse medium-long term development issues at 
the  national  level;  and  integrating  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  aspects  of 
development into a single framework.  It is a quite large model with over 3600 state variables 
and  several thousand feedback  loops,  covering more  than  55  sectors. The  sectors  particularly 
relevant  to  this  analysis  have  been  developed  fully,  as  described  in  section  6.  A  detailed 
description of the model, the structure of the sectors and the interlinkages can be found in the 
Threshold 21 (T21) iSDG Model documentation (MI 2016). 

 

19 

Dynamics within and between sectors are captured by the model. Thus, outcomes of scenarios 
or policy decisions that are analysed by the model are the results of the interlinked structure of 
the  system  itself.  The  model became functional for  the first time  in  2010  and  was  since  then 
continuously improved (for example concerning agriculture and recently to include the SDGs). A 
simplified summary diagram of the agriculture sector (in Figure 5) conveys the level of complexity 
and interaction, within just this one sector.

4. The Eco-Agri Rice Food System in Senegal from multiple perspectives:  
farmer, researcher, civil society, governance/think tank) 
 
Research methodology 
 
Two research methods are combined in this study. 
 

1-  To carry out the present analysis, information has been collected about the current status 
of as many of the stocks and outcomes presented in the TEEBAgriFood framework, across 
the  rice  value  chain.  Stakeholders  from  four  different  groups  –  a  female  farmer,  two 
researchers, a civil society representative, and people who have been interacting in an 
agriculture/governance think tank - were then asked to reflect on the predominant issues 
for each of the aspects considered.  (it should be noted that this is not a comprehensive 
multistakeholder  consultation;  individuals  presented  their  own  perspectives,  not  ones 
derived from extensive consultation with their communities.  Moreover, the perspective 
of  intermediaries  in  the  food  value  chain  –  such  as  millers  and  traders  –  was  not 
represented, due to the limitation of resources. 

 

2-  From  the  articulation  of  these  stakeholders,  prevailing 

issues,  possibly  policy 
interventions have been formulated (Section 5), and the outcomes of such interventions, 
as opposed to “business as usual” evaluated using the T21-iSDG model (Section 6). 

 
Following this rice value chain in the sections below, we review first the current status of issues 
related to rice, and current rice policy in Senegal. Within each issue area, we present a farmer 
perspective  on  alternate  pathways,  a  civil  society perspective,  a  researcher perspective  and  a 
governance/think tank perspective (while acknowledging that each of these are perspectives of 
individuals,  not  intended  to  represent  consultation  with  entire  sectors  or  the  viewpoint  of 
institutions). We then focus, in the subsequent section a systems model of the agriculture sector 
in Senegal, propose modeling modifications to reflect these alternate pathways, and analyze the 
results. 
 
The structure of the current rice value chain in Senegal is mapped in Figure 4, and the alternative 
value  chain  suggested  by  stakeholders  in  Figure  5  as  an  initial  overview  of  the  directions  in 
contrast taken by this study.

4.1. Farming systems issues 
 
Current status: Rice farming systems in Senegal are highly variable depending on region (Table 
1). Where irrigated rice cultivation is prominent there is a much higher input of resources, e.g. 
mechanization, herbicides and fertilizer use, compared to rainfed rice farming systems. In Saint-
Louis and Dagana even two growing seasons per year are possible and yields are by far higher 
compared to rainfed systems.

Farming system issues from a researcher perspective:  Rice production in Senegal is not without 
its  challenges.  Rice  yields  are  largely  challenged  by  infestation  from  weeds  and  birds.  Also, 
Senegal faces water scarcity, which affects rice production as well. Finally, rice fields with high

rainfed ecologies are introduced in all regions An irrigated scheme occurs in the Kokda Region, while the subsidies- farmers may have increased 
usage of inputs and mechanization in Fatick region. Yields in rainfed regions are low, but where irrigation is possible, the yields may increase to 
2-6 t/ha. (M. Diagne and R. Gaud, pers. comm.) 

 

 

23 

salt content and defiticts of Nitrogen (N) are limiting growth factors to which not all farmers have 
easy access for solutions.  
 
Alternative  practices:  To  respond  to  these  challenges,  the  predominant  agroecological  rice 
farming system in rice is SRI, System of Rice Intensification, or variations on its approach including 
the  Rice  Integrated  Crop  Management  (RICM)  that  allows  small-scale  farmer  to  significantly 
increase their yield and income depending on their resource endowment (Kebbeh and Miézan, 
2003)  The combination of simple changes in agronomic practices, which became known as SRI, 
was  developed  during  the  1980s  by  a  Jesuit  priest  in  close  collaboration  with  farmers  in 
Madagascar.  SRI  is  an  agroecological  rice  production  methodology  that  allows  farmers  to 
increase rice productivity while using less seed and water, and fewer purchased agrochemical 
inputs.  SRI  rice  fields  are  thought  to  adapt  better  to  climate  change  and  give  off  fewer 
greenhouse  gas  emissions.  SRI  does  not  rely  on  new  varieties,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  or 
infrastructure to raise yields. Rather, it is a knowledge-based crop management approach that 
allows plants to better express their genetic potential, which leads to improved plant growth and 
productivity.  Since  2000,  SRI  has  spread  to  many  countries;  it  is  estimated  that  10-15  million 
farmers  apply  SRI  methodologies  in  more  than  55  countries  of  Asia,  Africa  and  Latin  America 
(Styger & Traoré 2018). 
 
In conventional management practices, (a set of conventional practices as described by Krupnik 
et al. 2010) rice seeds are planted in a wet seedbed, within a layer of 1-4 cm of water. After 21 
to 23 days the rice plants are transplanted into paddies in the wet season and after 24 to 25 days 
in  the  dry  season.    In  the  System  of  Rice  Intensification  (SRI)  rice  seeds  are  sown  in  a  damp 
seedbed sown with a higher plant density, having a layer water of 0-1 cm. After 11 to 13 days in 
the  wet  seasons  the  rice  plants  are  transplanted.  In  the  dry  season  this  is  14  to  15  days. 
Transplanted rice plants suffer less from weed competition and from limitations in land leveling, 
but  direct  seeded  rice  plants  can  be  sown  with  a  higher  plant  density.  Fertility  and  weed 
management are timed according to transplantation or seeding day. 
 
Although SRI was originally developed for irrigated rice, for which full water control is possible, 
SRI practices have been successfully adapted to rainfed rice production. This has been especially 
true in West Africa, where most rice is grown in rainfed systems. Although conditions across West 
Africa may not always allow perfect implementation of the four principles (of early, quick and 
healthy plant establishment, reduced plant density, Improved soil conditions through enrichment 
with organic matter, and reduced and controlled water application), applying these principles, 
combined  with  an  understanding  of  the  synergies  created,  can  go  far  to  optimize  crop 
management.  
 

 

24 

The  System  of  Rice  Intensification  has  gained  critiques  -  along  with  its  popularity  -  from  rice 
scientists. For example, the reports of “super-high” rice yields have been widely condemned as 
faulty by researchers at a number of international institutions.  Other critics highlight the risks 
and disadvantages that should be considered alongside the potential benefits of SRI’s principles, 
such  as  greater  weed  growth  and  high  labour  requirements,  which  is  not  always  available  to 
farmers in Senegal (Krupnik & Sarr 2008). In addition, SRI requires strict control over water/water 
regime for irrigation and drainage, and strict timing is necessary. Besides that this is not always 
available or feasible it also requires levelled land (Stoop, 2003). As Krupnik and Sarr (2008) state: 
“Where farmers cannot enact all of these principles, they are encouraged to adapt and alter parts 
of  the  system  to  fit  site-specific  agronomic,  economic  and  cultural  needs.  SRI  should 
consequently not be thought of as a pre-packaged technology; rather it represents an integrated 
rice  production  approach  that  encourages  farmers  to  experiment  with  and  optimize  their 
management of soil, nutrient, water and biological relationships while attempting to maximize 
the efficient use of scarce natural resources”. This is essential to keep in mind as there might be 
circumstances in Senegal in which SRI is difficult to apply, for instance direct seeding is rather 
important in the SRV, there is a lack of equipment for mechanical transplanting, and rice straw 
and other rice by products are in various cases used for animal feeding.  
 
Challenges to apply in the case of Senegal come from the importance of direct seeding in the SRV, 
the lack of equipment for mechanical transplanting and the use the rice straw and other rice by 
products  for  animal  feeding  (M.Diagne,  pers.comm.)  However,  extensive  experience  in  its 
implementation, and highly positive outcomes in Senegal comes from the West Africa Agriculture 
Productivity  Program  (WAAPP)  --  executed  in  13 West  African  countries, led by the  West  and 
Central African  Council  for  Agricultural  Research  (CORAF/WECARD), and funded  by the  World 
Bank (Styger & Traoré 2018). 
 
Farming system issues from a civil society perspective:  The problem of rice production can be 
summarized as the interaction of multiple constraints closely linked to climate change, such as 
water deficit, salinization and acidification of cropland. The main causes of these constraints are: 
drought,  very  high  evaporation,  deforestation,  topography  and  relative  proximity  to  the  sea. 
Salinization,  soil  degradation  and  impoverishment  have  made  ecosystems  vulnerable.  These 
combined impacts have negatively affected agricultural activities in general and rice cultivation 
in particular and contributed significantly to the impoverishment of populations (AGRIDAPE, 2013). 
Rice  cultivation,  practiced  in the lowlands,  is under  serious  threat  from the effects  of  climate 
change, particularly from drought and land salinization.  

SRI, as a rice production technology, has demonstrated its value in comparison with control plots. 
The results have shown that it increased yields by 50 to 100% and often more, with a reduction 
in the amount of water, seeds and fertilizers used (AGRIDAPE, 2013). Having always believed that 

 

25 

permanent  flooding  and  mineral  fertilizers  such  as  NPK  and  Urea  were  essential  for  rice 
production,  SRI  has  shown  to  producers  that  not  only  is  it  possible  to  produce  rice  without 
mineral fertilizers, but that they can at least double yields. This success, recorded on a relatively 
small scale within Senegal, has led to a great popularity of this system among the population in 
the experimental areas. 

Proposed  policy  response  (synthesis  of  responses  from  stakeholder  inputs):  Faced  with  this 
situation,  it  is  becoming  urgent  to  provide  a  response  at  the  highest  level  and  to  reinforce 
transitions  to  more  sustainable  rice  production  at  all  levels,  particularly  at  the  local  level.  To 
combat  the  phenomena  of  salinization,  soil  degradation  and  impoverishment  and  revitalize 
agroecological rice cultivation, projects and programmes must support and expand the initiation 
of  producers  to  the  principles  of  the  SRI,  and  set  up  a  series  of  hydraulic  structures  that  can 
support the need to manage water on SRI principles. The successes achieved in the experimental 
areas  have  been  very  well  received  by  farmers  who  are  increasingly  adopting  this  innovative 
method of rice cultivation.  

4.2. Land tenure issues 

Current  status:  Land  tenure  in  Senegal  is  governed  by  legislation  giving  municipality  leaders 
control  over  land  allocation  and  management.  Rural  councils  have  considerable  discretionary 
power over land allocation. The primary means of accessing land is through inheritance, leasing, 
borrowing, land purchase, and allocations – all from local rural councils. Customary law, religion, 
and  political  party  membership  can  perpetuate  inequities  to  land  access.    The  central 
government is allowed to reclassify territorial lands as pioneer lands in order to regain control. 
Reclassification may occur when commercial players are interested in obtaining quality farmland, 
especially  in  the  Senegal  River  valley  (USAID  2010).  There  are  instances  when  rural  councils 
collude with commercial interests at the expense of poorer farmers in areas where land is highly 
productive and valuable. Finally, there is no formal expropriation and compensation procedure 
for expropriated land taken for projects such as irrigation development (USAID 2010). 

Land  tenure  issues  from  a  farmer  perspective:  To  promote  the  local  rice  value  chain,  local 
communities need to commit to allocating arable land for agroecological systems. At the moment, 
some cities and their leaders declare themselves agroecological and promote at the local level 
policies  favorable  to  agroecological  production.  Efforts  that  will  result  in  the  creation  of 
sustainable food  systems  at  the  local  level. These  lands  must be  registered  with their  market 
value for their holders to use them to have access to credit. Other challenges to access to land 
for  agroecological  systems,  are  the  customs  in  some  communities  that  do  not  give  land 
ownership  to  either  youth  or  women  Participatory  research  and  promotion  of  initiatives  to 

 

26 

redistribute rice fields for the benefit of women and young people is a possible as a strategy to 
promote agroecological rice farming in a sustainable way. 
 
Land tenure issues from a researcher perspective: Land tenure considerations have strong youth 
and gender equity components. Around 80 percent of Senegal’s population is younger than 35. 
The droughts of the 1970s and 1980s impacted heavily on rural incomes, and one of the major 
consequences of this has been the flight of young men towards cities, where they seldom find 
jobs,  leaving  disproportionately  large  numbers  of  women  in  the  countryside.  Thus,  a  major 
challenge to agriculture in Senegal is to sustain the sector by increasing investment in farms, and 
to  attract  young  people  back,  capable  of  absorbing  the  information  needed  to  use  new 
approaches, such as SRI (Seck et al. 2005).  An essential component of this is ensuring land tenure 
rights to youth and women, as a fundamental basis for securing equity and building new, diverse 
socio-professional communities in the agriculture sector. 

Land tenure issues from a civil society perspective: Rice cultivation in the off-season (for other 
crops)  predominates  in  rice  production.  This  system  may  lead  to  the  extension  of  cultivation 
areas to the detriment of pastoral rangelands or protected areas. Conflicts arise as a result of the 
encroachment of cultivated land into pastoral areas. 

Until 1987, most of the developments in the Senegal Valley were large and medium-sized state-
funded schemes. They were developed by peasant farms set up and supervised by SAED, which 
had held the Delta lands classified as a pioneer area since 1965. With liberalisation policies, the 
pioneering  area  of  the  Delta  was  transferred  in  1987  to  the  land  areas  managed  by  local 
authorities. The disengagement of SAED and the reduction of the State's investment resources 
have  favoured  the  development  of  private  perimeters  developed  by  individual  promoters  or 
organised as family or collective enterprises on land affected by the rural councils (Enda Pronat, 
2017).  

Despite their importance, the vast majority of the affected areas are not as yet developed. For 
the  areas  developed  by  the  State  and  especially  those  developed  by  the  private  sector,  the 
cultivation  rates  per  season  are  very  low.  The  developed  areas  are  partially  exploited  due  to 
degradation resulting from lack of maintenance, poor development, soil salinization and lack of 
a  drainage  system.  For  the  entire  left  bank  of  the  Senegal  River,  the  area  under  cultivation 
increased from 47,467 in 2006 to 73,844 in 2013, according to SAED.  

Proposed policy response: Develop and apply land management policies, particularly on the part 
of local government, that recognizes legal land ownership by women and youth, and explicitly 
allocates  land  for  agroecology.    Such  policies  should  consider  those  conditions  which  would 
enable the women and youth to economically develop the land provided to them, such as finance 

 

27 

(addressing  access  to  credit),  and  mechanization  (addressing  labour  demand).  The  explicit 
registration of land designated for agroecology, with credit policies aligned could enable farmers- 
including women and youth, to have access to credit. 

Digitalisation of  land  registration  could  also  help  to  monitor the  land  distribution  and  use for 
agriculture by the government or the local communities (M. Diagne, pers.comm.). 

4.3. Research and development on the production level 

Current  status:  Rice  production  has  benefited  from  a  relatively  high  level  of  national  and 
international research.  Much of this research has been on irrigated, high-input systems, even 
though the total irrigable area In Senegal is small (Masters 2007).  The acreage of irrigated rice in 
Senegal in 2008 was estimated at 53,000 hectares, out of a total of 125,000 hectares under rice 
cultivation (Senegal Ricepedia, http://ricepedia.org/senegal). 

Research and development issues from a farmer perspective: There has been a lot of research in 
the field of agroecology but agroecological practices have not been scaled up. To develop the 
local rice sector, research needs to begin by identifying needs by producers as barriers to scaling 
up,  working  with  research  institutions,  conducting  participatory  research  including  producers, 
capitalizing on results, and to popularize them. 

Research  and  development  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  From  1996/97,  SAED,  in 
partnership with the Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole du Sénégal (CNCAS) and WARDA (now 
Africa Rice), developed and implemented the "Riz de Qualité́" program as part of its technical 
programs, which took into account factors for improving productivity and quality. However, this 
programme,  as  it  has  so  far  been  developed,  does  not  promote  agroecological  practices,  soil 
fertility restoration, nor biodiversity and environmental protection. Indeed, this programme is 
mainly based on an intensification of technical approaches requiring the following: 

o  compliance with the crop calendar and fertilization recommendations;  
o  the use of high-performance rice varieties (Sahel 108, Sahel 202, Sahel 201 and IR 1529) 
characterized by their short and medium cycle (105 - 120 days) 7and a yield potential (9-
10 t/ha);  

o  the  production  of  rice  of  a  quality  that  ensures  a  good  processing  coefficient  during 
processing  (or milling rate, as the more common technical term) and makes it possible to 
produce the three categories of rice (broken, intermediate and whole);  

7 Update from reviewers: Only Sahel 108 is a short duration variety. S108, S201 and S202 were released in 1994. From 2005, 21 other improved 
varieties were released including a short duration variety (Sahel 134) and 3 aromatic varieties (Sahel 177, Sahel 328 and Sahel 329). A hybrid 
variety was also released in 2017. (M. Diagne, pers.comm.) 

 

 

28 

o  the improvement of processing performance;  
o  the promotion of local rice by putting rice millers producers and rice plants in contact with 

the distribution channel.  

While all these have value, the research supporting agroecological rice production, or systems of 
rice production that favors small-scale family farmers has not been supported. 

Research and development issues from a researcher perspective: There are many research gaps 
that  should  be  addressed  to  foster  more  holistic  rice  production  systems.  For  example,  the 
application of green manure in rice production systems is a key measure to both sustain fertility 
and address pest issues (see below) yet the research and management techniques developed for 
synthetic  inputs  are  not  adequate  for  effective  GM  use.  Conventional  inputs  deliver  readily 
known  and  adjustable  levels  of  nutrient,  and  have  well  documented,  consistent  patterns  of 
availability  or  action.  As  Cherr  et  al.  (2006)  notes,  “Green  manures,  however,  are  biological 
organisms affected by the cropping environment, regularly confounding direct control by farm 
managers”. As  with  many  agroecological  inputs, green  manure  provides multiple  services  (for 
example, nutrient supply, pest and weed control, and increase of soil organic matter), thus its 
management and calculation of benefits is inherently complex (Cherr et al. 2006). 
 
Another research gap, in supporting more organic forms of cultivation, is in balancing the trade-
off between using the organic matter such as rice straw to improve the structure of the soil and 
rice productivity, and the need to feed livestock. In rice production farmers are recommended to 
not export the straw outside the field to increase the availability of the potassium, nonethelees 
most do not follow this recommendation.  Research might look at the larger system, including 
the needs of animal agriculture, to seek solutions (M. Diagne, pers. comm.) 
 
As noted above, rice in West Africa has been the focus of considerable research, particularly with 
respect to irrigated, high-input systems, even though the total irrigable area In Senegal is  less 
than half of total rice production acreage (Masters 2007).   The alternative crops that may fare 
better in arid environments such as millet and fonio have not received sufficient research support, 
nor has agroecological approaches in general such as the effect and potential of water saving 
strategies (Djaman et al., 2018). Also, on-farm trials are essential to adapt research outcomes to 
local agronomic, social and economic circumstances (Krupnik & Sarr, 2008). 

Proposed policy response:  Research funding is a  sustainability and  national security issue that 
involves state policies and expenditure. The latter must strengthen the seed sector, and support 
farmers to better save their seeds and improve certain farming practices in rice seed production 
and conservation. It must also subsidize organic fertilizers to facilitate access to these products 
for producers, so that they can restore the fertility of their soils. This would help to safeguard the 

 

29 

farmers'  seed  capital.  These  research  directions  should  be  supported  by  advocacy  towards 
decision-makers and awareness raising for the public.  For example, fairs can be organized for 
the general public so that the SRI technique and agroecological intensification can be mastered 
and scaled up.  

4.4. Training and education 
 
Current status: BAU promotes increased diffusion of crop management options to reduce yield 
gaps, through agricultural extension agents.  

Training and education issues from a farmer perspective: Increased farmer training of integrated 
and agroecological crop management options to reduce yield gaps in both irrigated and rainfed 
systems is needed. There are many agroecological farms in Senegal that provide trainings which 
are not officially recognized by the ministry of education For example, the work of Kaydara School 
Farm in Senegal has led to concrete benefits for the community and for the environment (see 
http://www.fao.org/agroecology/database/detail/en/c/1055842/).  As  another  example,  ENDA 
Pronat worked with other CSOs to develop a partnership with Cheikh Anta Diop  University to 
introduce  a  professional  license  and  Master  on  agroecology.    It  is  important  to  support  the 
development  and  the  official  recognition  of  knowledge  provided  by  the  agroecological  farms. 
Agroecology must be included in Senegal's national agricultural and education policies. In this 
way academic training and the ongoing training of agricultural extension agents will also include 
agroecology and they will be able to support farmers with the needed skills.  

Training and education issues from a civil society perspective: The State must, on the one hand, 
demand  more  integration  of  SRI  and  agroecological  intensification  into  agricultural  training 
curricula.  And  on  the  other  hand,  SRI's  outreach  programmes  should  be  multiplied  in 
collaboration  with  all  stakeholders.  As  part  of  SRI  and  sustainable  food  system  development 
programmes, the financial capacities of civil society organizations should be strengthened to help 
them better disseminate SRI and agroecological intensification in a comprehensive manner, with 
a good monitoring and evaluation system. 

It is now essential to strengthen: (i) training on agroecological intensification and SRI in schools 
and  in  the  field  with  the  farmer-school  field  approach  (participatory  action  research)  and 
functional  literacy;  (ii)  awareness-raising  on  environmental  issues  and  risks  involved  with  the 
conventional rice production system; (iii) farmers' organization to rebuild local seed capital and 
advocate for the enhancement of farmer seed. 

Training and education issues from a researcher perspective:  Support for agricultural extension 
services is back on the agenda of donors; for example, the World Bank Programme des Services 

 

30 

Agricoles et Organisations de Producteurs du Senegal (PSAOP) has sought to increase smallholder 
agricultural  productivity,  production  and  incomes,  through  increasing  access  to  agricultural 
services  and  empowering  producer  organizations,  through  technology  transfer  (World  Bank 
2006).  This support is in the form of a loan, which the government of Senegal must pay back, 
presumably  through  the  greater  revenues  from  agricultural  productivity  resulting  from  the 
program, with significant impacts on Senegal’s balance of payments.   

However, the standard technology transfer approach has shown its weaknesses, in assuming a 
one-way  flow  of 
information  and  techniques,  without  respecting  the  expertise  and 
understanding  of  challenges  of  farmers.    An  increasing  corps  of  people  focusing  on  effective 
farmer training are recognizing the value of a very different approach, that of farmer-led research 
in farmer field schools and farmer-researcher networks.  The depth of understanding that can be 
developed  on  context-specific  challenges  and  solutions  by  beginning  with  farmer  experiences 
and fostering co-creation of knowledge between farming communities, scientists and extension 
agents (Nelson et al. 2016) is increasingly being acknowledged and used to structure training and 
education.  Strong social relations and social cohesion among farmers is thus essential for scaling 
up of agroecological practices (Jenkins 2015).  

Proposed policy response: Policy must recognize the value of participatory research, that fosters 
and supports interaction between actors involved – noting that interaction is essential not only 
between  researchers  and  farmers,  but  also  among  farmers,  if  a  significant  societal  impact  is 
sought from research and education.  

Thus, policy measures must support: 

o  the development and the official recognition of knowledge provided by the agroecological 

farms; 

o 

o  research on scaling up agroecology, identifying needs by producers as barriers to scaling 
up,  working  with  research  institutions,  conducting  participatory  research  including 
producers, capitalizing on results; 
increase  farmer  training  of  integrated  and  agroecological  crop  management  options 
(including systems of rice intensification in both lowland and upland rice); 
include  Agroecology  in  Senegal's  national  agricultural  and  education  policies  so  that 
academic  training  and  the  ongoing  training  of  agricultural  extension  agents  includes 
agroecology and they will be able to support farmers with the needed skills. 

o 

Research funding is a sustainable national security issue that involves the state. The latter must 
strengthen the seed sector support fund and help farmers to better save their seeds to improve 
certain farming practices in rice seed production and conservation. It must also subsidize organic 

 

31 

fertilizers to facilitate access to these products for producers, so that they can restore the fertility 
of their soils. This would help to safeguard the farmers' seed capital. This must be supported by 
lobbying, advocacy towards decision-makers, the organisation of information fairs for the general 
public so that the SRI technique and agroecological intensification can be mastered and scaled 
up to the scale of large rice crates. 

4.5. Traditional knowledge 
 
Current  status:  In  the  current  agricultural  research  and  extension work of the  Government of 
Senegal,  there  is  little  recognition  of  traditional  knowledge,  including  preservation  and 
dissemination of techniques used by women who are producing and processing indigenous rice 
in  ecologically-friendly  ways  (as  has  been  supported  by  a  New  Field  project  in  Burkina  Faso). 
Research  priorities  on  both  intensification  of  rice  production  and  poverty  reduction  do  not 
consider traditional knowledge; for example, the specific agricultural objectives in PSRP include 
modernizing equipment, supporting markets, improving access to lands, increasing agricultural 
research, and improving the management of the agricultural sector. (GTF website) 
 
Traditional knowledge issues from a farmer perspective: Traditional knowledge in agroecology is 
the  basis  of  everything,  it  affects  all  areas  of  production.  But  it  needs  to  be  documented, 
capitalized and shared among producers. It is important to support more exchanges between 
producers and capitalization among agro-ecological rice producers between producers in Senegal 
and those in countries like Burkina Faso and Benin 
 
Traditional  knowledge  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  Civil  society  must  do  more  to 
advocate  with  international  policy  makers  and  institutions  for  the  recognition  of  traditional 
knowledge  and  farmers'  rights,  based  on  the  International  Treaty  on  Genetic  Resources  for 
Agriculture and Food (ITPGRFA).  As noted by the farmer perspective above, it is important to 
support  more  exchanges  among agroecological rice  producers,  between  producers in  Senegal 
and  those  in  countries  like  Burkina  Faso  and  Benin  and  also  from  countries  in  Southeast  Asia 
(Cambodia). 

Traditional  knowledge  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective:    Considerable  research  has 
documented the contribution of traditional knowledge in rice cultivation in Senegal.  Much of the 
scientific literature has focused on the Jola people; as noted by Linares (2009):  

“The Jola have been among the most skilled rice producers of West Africa for centuries, 
growing  both  upland  and  flood  rice  in  the  inundated  valleys  and  mangrove-lined  river 
channels (marigots) lying along the flood plains and the tributaries of the Casamance River. 
They have produced mostly for home consumption, but their history tells us something 

 

32 

about the gendered development of farming skills in complex rural economies. Numbering 
approximately 400,000 persons, they live in numerous scattered communities located in 
the southwestern corner of Senegal known as Lower Casamance. Initially, they grew only 
the  indigenous  African  species  of  rice  known  as  Oryza  glaberrima,  then  shifted  to 
introduced  varieties  of  the  Asian  species  Oryza  sativa.  Their  sophisticated  rice-growing 
technologies  include  bunding  the  rice  parcels  to  retain  rainwater,  cutting  down  the 
mangrove and then flushing out the salts, carving out deep fields surrounded by tall walls, 
and building sturdy dikes to keep the brackish marigot water out of their fields. Farmers in 
some communities raise fish in ponds along the tall dikes. The Jola distribute and circulate 
rainwater and fresh water from uphill springs among various categories of rice fields by 
cutting through, or plugging up, the bunds. Everywhere, they transplant the seedlings from 
numerous rice varieties into flooded fields, or direct-seed (i.e., broadcast the seed) into 
upland fields.”  

This intricate system of production is however under threat from current pressures.  As Linares 
(2009)  notes,  severe  droughts  have  impacted  rice-growing  systems  in  Senegal  and  adjacent 
countries  for  several  decades.  The  migration  of  young  men  to  cities  has  caused  sever  labor 
shortages, leading to the neglect and eventual collapse of the dikes protecting the mangrove-
recovered fields. Brackish water has invaded and destroyed some of the best-yielding fields. 

As can be seen, the contributions of traditional knowledge to rice production in Senegal is not 
archival  material  from  the  past;  their  vibrancy  and  life  is  very  much  in  the  present.    As 
documented by Linares (2009), skilled Jola women farmers in the Casamance region of southern 
Senegal work to maintain their complex system of irrigated and upland production.  They have 
made  use  of  their  ‘‘traditional’’  knowledge  and  farming  skills  to  shift  crop  repertoires  and 
techniques so as to embark on market-gardening, thus innovating in response to new needs and 
perceived opportunities (Linares 2009). In a project coordinated by the Institute for Development 
Studies, traditional oral communicators are presently involved in promoting agroecology to the 
wider  public  through  community  radio  broadcasts  while  farmer  organisations  establish  local 
schemes for multiplying traditional peasant seeds so that traditional varieties are more widely 
available. Farmer groups are establishing a network of organisations and stakeholders to take 
actions  for  agroecological  transitions  and  have  begun  farmer  exchanges  to  share  technical 
expertise (Taylor 2017). 
 
It is important to make a case why traditional varieties may be replaced. The intention is not to 
discard landraces; in fact these varieties co-exist along side the improved varieties. New varieties 
have  been  created  to  address  a  certain  productivity-limiting  factors  such  as  susceptibility  to 

 

33 

disease, salinity, etc. The combination of the two may answer many needs (Africa rice researcher, 
pers. comm.). 

Proposed policy response: (see above, and also with seeds and genetic resources) Dissemination 
of technology without state involvement (e.g. farmer to farmer propagation, dissemination of 
best practices, support the development and the official recognition of knowledge provided by 
the agroecological farms etc.) 

4.6. Irrigated rice production - General 

Current status: Irrigated rice is the most productive form of rice production. in the Sahel region 
as a whole, irrigated rice produces 8.5% of regional rice production, although irrigation potential 
is estimated to be much greater, estimated at more than 3 million ha along the Senegal, Niger, 
Black Volta, Chari, and Logone rivers (Maclean et al. 2013).  

Seventy percent of the total rice production in Senegal is irrigated and takes mainly place in the 
Senegal  River  Valley.  The  Government  of  Senegal  (GoS)  has  played  a  major  role  in  the 
development of the irrigation infrastructure in the Senegal River Valley. The two main schemes 
managed by the government are the Large-Scale Irrigation Schemes (Grande Aménagement, GA) 
and the Village Irrigation Schemes (Périmètre Irrigué Villageois, PIV). The Large-Scale Irrigation 
Schemes  cover  areas  over  1000  hectares  including  both  canals  and  drainage  networks.  The 
Village Irrigation Schemes are smaller (15-50 hectares) and only consist of canal infrastructure 
(no  drainage  canals).  The  government  remained  mainly  involved  in  developing  irrigation 
infrastructure  until  1994.  Thus,  the  state  has  played  a  lead  role  in  developing  and  managing 
irrigated rice schemes, with over 75% of the areas currently under parastatal control (Bogdanski 
et al. 2016).  
 
Because of disengagement of the GoS in the nineties, private investments formed the Private 
Irrigation Schemes (Périmètre Irrigué Privé, PIP). These schemes cover areas of maximum 500 
hectares and they have no drainage facilities (Wolfe et al. 2009).  

The technical potential of irrigated rice has attracted large public investments in West Africa over 
the last century: the first irrigation schemes were constructed in the Sahel in the 1920s. Under 
the  introduction  of  privatization  policies,  rice  investment  schemes  are  increasingly  being 
managed by actors from the private sector (Maclean et al. 2013). Investment in agribusiness rice 
schemes call for rehabilitation of irrigation systems in disuse and building of new systems to yield 
an  average  cropping  intensity  of  at  least  1.5  rice  crops  per  year  in  these  schemes.  Yet  many 
challenges remain within high-input rice cultivation, including its negative externalities.   Many 
farmers in Senegal also confront basic production challenges under conventional production: the 

 

34 

late arrival of inputs or delay in harvesting of the previous crop often leads to important yield 
losses. Weed infestation, in particular in direct-seeded fields, and bird damage are also major 
constraints. 

At the same time, Senegal has also a strong tradition and component of irrigated rice production 
from  smallholder  and  family  farmers,  both  in  the  Senegal  River  Valley  and  in  the  Casamance 
region of southern Senegal.  Many studies have documented that investment in infrastructure 
could facilitate, not simply large agri-business schemes, but greater community and family farmer 
control over water for rice production.  For instance, the implementation of SRI in non-improved 
lowlands has been constrained by the impossibility of water control, as plots were not leveled 
and were exposed to sudden flooding after heavy rainfall. The creation of bunds along contour 
lines  as  well  as  leveling  the  plots  for  better  water  management  would  be  appropriate 
investments along these lines (Styger & Traoré 2018). 

There are many ecosystem services provided by irrigated rice systems that should be recognized 
in  an  accounting  of  costs  and  benefits.  For  example,  groundwater  recharge  is  a  provisioning 
ecosystem  services  provided  by  rice  paddies.  When  rice  fields  are  flooded,  standing  water 
percolates through the soil and recharges the groundwater. Although a significant part of the 
water  flows  back  into  river  or  drainage  channels,  around  seven  percent  recharges  the 
underground aquifers (Bogdanksi et al. 2016; Abdullah 2002).  

Sensitive  management  of  irrigated  rice  production  systems  may  also  have  benefits  for  the 
moderation of extreme weather events, as described below under the researcher perspective. 

Irrigated  rice  production  issues  (general)  from  a  farmer  perspective:  Community-based  rice 
cooperatives are an alternative approach to organization of irrigated rice production systems. 
However, local rice cooperatives at the community level are not common. Rice is produced by 
households, once harvested, the rice is stored in family granaries. Scaling up local rice needs to 
do  action  research  in  the  production  areas  on  the  type  of  storage  and  its  agroecological 
community management. 

In addition, there is strong need to support to small scale irrigation infrastructure; it is important 
to encourage dikes and bunds in the lowlands to retain and manage the "surplus" rainwater and 
control salt accumulation. Some experiments have been started in this direction both in Senegal 
and other west African countries like Burkina Faso. 

Irrigated  rice  production  issues  (general)  from  a civil  society perspective:  In the  Senegal  River 
Valley, where there is a relatively abundant water resource, access to irrigation water for family 
farms and its management is still a concern in rice fields, because the efforts made by the State 

 

35 

in the development of irrigation infrastructure are insufficient in this region, and even less so in 
other regions. In some places, in the middle Valley (for example in the department of Podor), 
large pumping stations are temporarily nonfunctional and/or with limited irrigation capacity in 
time and space. Family farms that do not have enough financial resources to equip themselves 
with a pumping system within their reach are condemned to produce under tense conditions of 
access to water with very high hydraulic costs to bear. 

Canal maintenance work is not regularly carried out in major rice developments schemes because 
of a lack of rigorous monitoring on both the SAED and operator sides, resulting in loss of pressure 
and pumping system efficiency. 

Drainage networks in large rice development schemes are major sources of pollution of the river 
water where they are directly connected, but also of the groundwater through the infiltration of 
floodwater from rice plots. These drains, which are loaded with chemical fertilizer and pesticide 
residues,  constitute  major  health  risks  of  contamination of  people  and local  animal  and plant 
biodiversity. Unfortunately, this major public health risk is not yet taken seriously by the various 
rice promotion programmes. 

Irrigated rice production issues (general) from a researcher perspective: As discussed earlier, rice 
farmers  in  Senegal  are  facing  challenges  such  as  yield  losses  by  weeds  and  birds  and  water 
conflicts (Hathie et al. 2013. In irrigated rice systems, farmers use pesticides, which might end up 
in waterways affecting water quality. Also, mineral fertilizer input can cause eutrophication of 
waterways. Although needed to improve rice yields, fertilizer and pesticides are not accessible to 
all farmers.  
 
To  provide  water  to  the  irrigated  rice  paddies,  irrigation  infrastructure  is  needed,  including 
pumps  and  other  machinery  which  might  be  costly.  The  irrigation  infrastructure  is  mainly 
managed by farmers themselves and therefore requires strong social relations and trust.  
 
The primary  agroecological  alternative to  conventional  rice production  is  SRI,  Systems  of  Rice 
Intensification, an agroecological methodology for increasing the productivity of irrigated rice by 
changing  the  management  of  plants,  soil,  water  and  nutrients.  This  production  approach  is 
described above, here we note the scientific documentation of its benefits: increased yields of 
20-50%  or  more,  a  reduction  in  seed  use  of  80-90%,  and  up  to  50%  water  savings 
(http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/FAQs1.html). 
 

The  infrastructure  of  irrigated  rice  farms  in  Senegal  is  mainly  managed  by  the  farmers 
themselves, without state involvement. This is an important aspect to appreciate, as it requires 
strong  social  relationships  and  levels  of  trust.    In  other  regions,  the  scope  for  expanding 

 

36 

irrigation  infrastructure  to  serve  multiple  purposes  has  been  explored,  such  as  “Perimeter 
Engineering” This approach recognizes that the “green infrastructure” created by communities 
managing water together may serve, not just to function for weed control in rice, but also as 
landscape  elements  that  capture  floodwaters  during  the  rainy  season,  and  thus  recharge 
groundwater that may be used during drier periods.  This is the concept behind the “Ganges 
Water  Machine”  (http://wle.cgiar.org/blogs/2013/05/21/),  a  long  debated  concept  to  find  a 
solution to water issues in the Ganges River Basin in India, where 80% of the monsoon-driven 
river  flow  occurs  during  a  four  month  period.    While  rice  systems  do  serve  in  this  capacity 
already,  the  logistics  of  optimizing  such  functions  across  an  entire  river  basin  –  remain 
challenging. It is unlikely that this can be accomplished simply by farmer training, as a social 
investment in creating such a system of bunds and dikes is needed. The direct effects of such an 
investment  would  be  to  increase  employment  (initially  for  a  few  years,  and  ultimately  for 
continued maintenance), increase productivity due to ability to manage water levels, provide 
resilience (protect against drought and floods), and allow greater fish or duck cultivation in rice 
paddies.  

Proposed policy response:  

• 

• 

Implement agro-livestock integration (see also recycling) we will mention that for rice, 
the  integration  more  specifically  refers  to  fish-rice  integration,  but  that  with  this 
assumptions concerning agro-livestock, we represent the AE principle and also the impact 
(through  better  use  of  by-products  of  livestock  for  crops  (manure) and by-products  of 
crops (animal feed) for livestock, use of animal force for crops production etc. all together 
increasing yield) 
Implement  and  invest  in  climate  change  adaptation  (e.g.  local  seed  use,  moisture 
management, research, restore habitats etc.)  

•  Diversify production and increase income 
•  Support  the  construction  of  dikes  and  bunds  in  the  lowlands  to  retain  /  manage  the 

"surplus" rainwater and control salt 

•  Enhance the provisioning of ecosystem services (including pollination and soil health e.g. 
through polycropping, intercropping, crop rotation, multi-layer farming etc.) by enabling 
the implementation of sustainable land management supporting specifically small-scale 
production,  processing  and  storage  in  a  holistic  way  (including  training,  awareness, 
research  but  also  access  to  equipment  and  credit,  investment  in  small  scale  mills  and 
community  storage  options,  as  well  as  support  of  marketing  of  AE  products)  (see  also 
synergy) 

 

37 

•  Experiment  with  drainage  water  treatment  systems  through  the  introduction  of  plant 
species  for  wastewater  filtration;  such  experiments  need  to  be  carefully  developed  so 
that any introduced species will not infest farmers’ fields. 

•  Support small holders to implement small-scale irrigation, along with possible interlinked 

benefits of perimeter engineering.  

4.7. Irrigated rice production - Seeds and genetic diversity 

Current status: Seed is often difficult for farmers to obtain; farmers save seed for replanting but 
are  not  assisted  to  do  so.    Seed  is  being  develop  through  conventional  breeding  programs, 
focusing on input-responsive seed (commercially produced) and high inputs to  improve yields. 
The development of the rice seed sector is anticipated to occur primarily through private sector 
actors. 

Irrigated rice production- seeds and genetic diversity issues from a farmer perspective: 

Development of the rice seed sector is needed through community seed banks: 

In order to develop the rice seed sector and cover community needs, it is important to have 
seed banks at the very local level.  This will only be possible, if there is a:  

1)  An inventory of local / traditional / peasant seeds;- of relevance to rainfed systems.  
2)  A research on technical itineraries (next to peasant knowledge); 
3)  An awareness raising of the communities based on the results of the research and finally 
4)  develop a commercial valuation system. 

 
A scale up of pilot projects in seed production and conservation in needed.  

Irrigated rice production- seeds and genetic diversity issues from a researcher perspective:  

Farmer  participation  in agricultural research  is  increasingly  seen  as  a  pathway to  increase the 
relevance  of  improved  seeds  developed  to  benefit  farmers’  communities.    This  is  well 
acknowledged by many in the crop breeding community with however some criticism that there 
are  higher  costs  of  participatory  plant  breeding  (PPB)  compared  to  conventional  breeding. 
Mangione  et  al.  (2006)  have  shown  that  there  are  no  relevant  differences  between  the 
participatory and the non-participatory plant breeding programs, and that in fact decentralized-
participatory breeding programs reach the same level of development of the breeding material 
three years earlier than a centralized– non-participatory breeding program. Participatory may be 
capable  of  generating  more  information due to the  use  of  more trials  at  each  site,  improving 
selection efficiency.

The  scope  for  encouraging  greater  participatory  breeding  to  meet  the  tastes  of  different 
populations  has been  somewhat  explored  in  Senegal.    Farmers  do not  always  readily take  up 
improved varieties, which may be explained by the fact that these varieties are not adapted for 
farmers’  needs,  preferences  and  conditions.  In  the  upland  rice/groundnut  cultivation  zone  of 
Senegal,  Kanfany  et  al.  (2016)  invited  29  farmers  (both  men  and  women)  were  invited  to 
participate in a breeding selection process.  The rankings of farmers were not according solely to 
yields,  but  rather  related  to  characteristics  of  earliness,  moderate  height,  yield,  and  termite 
tolerance. 

With respect to the development of seed systems, despite the existence of UNIS (Union Nationale 
Interprofessionnelle Semence),  there is no proper planning of the needs of the different type of 
seed (foundation, certified), the control system is weak, and there is a lack of specialized funding 
for seed commercialization, and lack of seed storage, A new business model for seed production 
and distribution is needed (M. Diagne, pers. comm.) 

Irrigated  rice  production  seeds  and  genetic  diversity  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective: 
Research (ISRA, AfricaRice), private seed operators and the control service provided by DISEM 
constitute  the  backbone  of  the  certified  seed  production  system  in  Senegal.  The  current 
availability of certified rice seed under the community seed production programmes initiated by 
producers  and  supported  by  ANCAR,  in  partnership  with  ISRA,  DA/DISEM,  CARITAS,  POGV, 
ASPRODEB, has made it possible to satisfy, in part, the producers' requests, but not for traditional 
varieties. Indeed, the latter mainly use certified rice seeds listed in the official catalogue to the 
detriment of traditional varieties left out by the State's research and agricultural programmes 
(Enda Pronat, 2018). 

Certified rice seeds are sometimes more productive but have very limited agronomic capacities 
(low genetic diversity), specific to an area or environment, thus limiting their capacity to adapt. 
In  addition,  they  require  the  application  of  a  fairly  expensive  technological  package  based  on 
synthetic  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides  that  are  not  always  available  to  producers.  In 
addition, R3 certified seed ages over time and loses its productive capacity, becoming no longer 
suitable for propagation for certification.  

Another  researcher  perspective,  from  AfricaRice,  notes  that  is  important  to  make  a  case  why 
traditional varieties are replaced. The intention is not to throw them away; in fact these varieties 
co-exist along side the improved varieties. The new varieties are indeed called improved because 
they  are  created  to  address  a  certain  challenge.  It  is  not  just  about  productivity,  but  the 
productivity-limiting factor such as susceptibility to disease, salinity, etc. Reliance on traditional 
varieties alone will not lead to the food security/sovereignty. They can continue to be grown, and 

 

39 

even be marketed according to the consumer needs and preferences. However, we should not 
forget the idea why new varieties are called for in the first place (AfricaRice, pers.comm.) 

Proposed  policy  response:  Develop  and  support  community  seed  banks  at  the  local  level, 
including  research,  inventories,  and  awareness  raising  and  small-scale  seed  enterprises.  
Strengthen seed systems overall. 

4.8. Irrigated rice production - Water management practices 

Current status: Mean paddy yields are currently about 4.5 t/ha but vary widely from as low as 1 
t/ha, rising to 4–6 t/ha (Maclean et al. 2013).  

Irrigated rice production- water management practices issues from a farmer perspective: New 
ways  of  assisting  farmer  communities  to  store  and  mange  water  are  being  identified.    For 
example, a water-gathering and storage system put in place through FAO’s “1 million cisterns for 
the Sahel” programme focuses on vulnerable rural communities in arid and semi-arid regions of 
five countries affected by climate shocks.  Women, their families and local masons have been 
trained to build cisterns for year-round water storage. The cisterns hold water harvested from a 
collection area such as the rooftop of a hangar or shed. The beneficiaries and masons were paid 
for their work while the farmers received training in resilient agricultural practices (FAO 2019). 

Irrigated  rice  production-  water  management  practices  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective: 
According  to  de  Vries  et  al.  (2010),  in  irrigated  lowland  rice  cultivation  areas  in  Senegal  the 
recommended water depth is 10 to 15 centimetres permanently flooded. Although, it should be 
noted  that  depending  upon  how  irrigation  water  is  distributed,  water  management  may  be 
modified.  There is a positive correlation between water depth and plant performance. However, 
irrigation is costly, and water is becoming scarcer in Senegal. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) 
in which fields are not continuous flooded has been proposed as an alternative to save water. 
AWD is also applied under the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) until the reproductive stage, 
including a shallow water depth.   

The dependence on water of the rice farming sector is a huge challenge as freshwater resources 
are  becoming  increasingly  depleted  due  to  competing  water  uses  from  the  residential  and 
industrial  sector  and  as  rainfall  is  increasingly  erratic  due  to  climate  change  and  variability. 
According to FAO water experts any evidence-base on “water use efficiency” should be multiple 
scale and based on sound water accounting (Perry & Steduto 2017). If there is not a sound water 
accounting framework, one will miss a number of trade-offs, for instance: 
 

•  More water efficient means less storage benefits and less groundwater recharge. 

 

40 

• 

It also means less of a number of ecosystem services linked to biodiversity, micro-climate, 
connected wetlands, part of the landscape feeding off “water losses” (such as the very 
productive wooded areas/trees, etc.). 

•  Water saving regimes will increase the weed biomass as flood irrigation is practiced to 

suppress weeds. Weed pressure is a major constraint for rice yield. 

•  An important term when considering the trade-offs between water quantity and food 

production is water productivity. This describes rice yield divided by the total water 
input. Under water saving rice cultivation systems, water productivity increases, yet 
there may be the possibility of saltwater intrusion. Rice production in Senegal can be 
severely affected by saltwater intrusion.  

•  Under  water  saving  systems  major  water  savings  can  be  achieved.  However,  without 
proper weed management yields will suffer from weed competition. Weed control under 
water saving regimes is found to be very effective to keep yields on a certain level. 

The primary approach to addressing water in rice cultivation in a holistic manner is the System of 
Rice  Intensification  (SRI),  as  described  earlier.  SRI  has  been  documented  to  lead  to  increased 
yields, often by 50% or more, while using 90% less seed, 30-50% less water and less agro-chemi-
cals, and can be  implemented in both irrigated and rainfed lowland systems. The average SRI 
yield for irrigated rice in Senegal was 6.6 t/ha compared to 4.23 t/ha for conventionally grown 
rice (N=292 sites), a 56% increase. For rainfed lowland systems, SRI yields averaged 4.71 t/ha, 
compared  to  2.53  t/ha  for  conventional  rice  (N=441),  an  86%  increase.  The  estimated  total 
additional  quantity  of  rice  produced  with  SRI  compared  to  conventional  rice  during  the 
2015/2016  growing  season  alone  was  31,458  tons  of  paddy,  or  20,113  tons  of  milled  rice, 
representing a value of 10.07 million USD dollars. (Styger & Traoré 2018). 

Irrigated rice production - water management practices issues from a civil society perspective: 
The  summary  nature  of  some  developments,  particularly  those  encountered  in  initiatives  to 
extend village irrigated perimeters, makes water management more difficult rather than easier. 
A better leveling of the plots would allow a more rigorous management of the water brought in. 
However, the use of public works machinery entails a cost that individual farmer cannot bear.  

Rice cultivation recharges the groundwater until it is flush with the surface, causing salts to rise 
to  the  surface  at  the  same  time  as  creating  a  dynamic  water  concentration  (Salvignol  1993). 
Indeed, the conventional system of permanent flooding of rice plots is at the origin of irrigation 
water losses, which not only lead to the degradation of facilities and high pumping costs, but also 
to the rise of groundwater on the surface. The rice plot flooding system can incur three types of 
foreseeable losses in the irrigating channels (Salvignol 1993): 

 

41 

- 

losses by infiltration, however, the design of channels with stiff stabilizing elements 
makes them these losses low; 

-  direct losses, they consist of a flow through the groundwater, so they end up in the 

- 

drains; 
losses due to overflows. they are real and have been noted. They are difficult to quantify 
but seem to be the main factor explaining the increase in water consumption and losses.  

Changing attitudes, while far from easy, seems to be the basis for significant improvements. It is 
indeed necessary for farmers to stop believing that all the water entering their plot is used only 
for rice growth.  

For the efficient management of irrigation water and in order to increase water productivity, 
the intermittent irrigation technique such as SRI advocated by a large number of research and 
development organizations is very little known to farmers. It is a water-saving technology, in 
contrast to conventional rice irrigation, where rice fields are kept flooded throughout the 
growing and development season. SRI and intermittent irrigation techniques alternate watering 
and drying, which makes it possible to directly reduce the quantity of irrigation water intended 
for rice fields. 

Another way of improving the situation would be to act directly on the rise of the groundwater 
table.  To this end, crop diversification, by limiting excessive groundwater recharge, would be a 
solution. 

Proposed  policy  response:  Greater  support  should  be  allocated  to  water-saving  rice  farming 
systems such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and Systems of Rice Intensification. Both 
greater investment in research and on-farm training is needed. 

Water  resource-use  efficiency  should  be  increased  (e.g.  replace  inefficient  with  efficient 
irrigation equipment and support research and on-farm trainings on water saving practices)  
-  Decrease of expenditure for (inefficient) irrigation equipment frees money for other purposes 
-  Increase of expenditure for efficient irrigation equipment 
-  Support small-scale irrigation equipment 
-  Set up a training support fund for pump operators and operators as part of the extension of 
the  SRI  to  better  adapt  the  volumes  of  irrigation  pumped  to  needs  (optimal  irrigation). 
Training activities must be strengthened in this direction.

4.9. Irrigated rice production - Fertilizer management practices 

Current status: Conventional fertilizers are mostly imported, except for phosphate that is mined 
in  the  country.  To  maintain  and  increase  soil  fertility  and  thereby  increase  yield,  chemical 
fertilizers  are  generally  applied.  However,  nutrient  use  efficiencies  are  rather  low  in  Senegal.  
Fertilizers are subsidized by the Government of  Senegal. Subsidised fertilizer is about half the 
price  of  non-subsidised  fertilizer  (Osinski  &  Sylla  2018);  The  total  subsides  for  Senegal  is  72.6 
million, where 30 % is allocated to fertilizers. 

Most fertilizers have been subsidized at 50 percent, meaning the government pays for 50 percent 
of the farmer’s fertilizers through government-approved and registered tenders and the farmer 
purchases  the  remainder  of  their  fertilizer  through  the  private  market  (Bumb  et  al.  2011). 
Farmers  are  responsible  for  obtaining  their  fertilizer  from  the  suppliers’  warehouses,  and  80 
percent of the fertilizers on the market are government approved tenders (ibid). 
 
Irrigated  rice  production  -  fertilizer  management  practices  issues  from  a  farmer  perspective: 
Agroecological producers should be encouraged to produce, collect and market their own natural 
fertilizers  (cow  dung,  dead  leaf  humus,  compost,  etc.);  At  the  same  time,  it  is  necessary  to 
advocate for increased access to natural fertilizers subsidized by the government.  Alternatively, 
community-based compost production experiences must multiply and scale up. 
 
Irrigated rice production - fertilizer management practices issues from a researcher perspective:  
Rice requires about 20 kg of nitrogen per ton of the harvested crop. About half of this is recycled 
into  the  soil  in  the  crop  residue;  therefore  about  10  kg  of  nitrogen  is  removed  per  ton  of 
harvested grain. A 6-ton rice harvest removes about 60 kg of nitrogen from the soil, equivalent 
to 300 kg of ammonium sulfate fertilizer.  
 
Chemical  fertilizers  ending  up  in  waterways  may  cause  eutrophication;  these  negative 
externalities  of  fertilizers  are  well  documented.  Blooms  of  phytoplankton  (including 
cyanobacteria) are widespread, mainly caused by phosphorous (P) inputs (in combination with 
environmental factors, like changes in light and temperature). Lakes and tributaries along the 
Senegal  River  are  subject  to  these  P  inputs,  while  they  are  used  by  the  local  populations  as 
freshwater supplies (for example as drinking water for the capital Dakar). Nitrogen (N) fertilizer 
application proves to be profitable in irrigated rice cultivation systems in Senegal to increase yield. 
However, N is applied in relatively low application rates and the timing of N applications is not 
optimal. Although application rates of N are low and it is not the main cause of eutrophication in 
Western Africa, N use efficiencies of rice plants are sub-optimal, resulting in losses of N (Bado et 

 

43 

al. 2011). Bado et al. (2011) stated that response to N by rice in Senegal can be increased by 
improving weed control as the presence of weeds increases N loss (Bogdanski et al. 2016). 
 
In  addition,  Senegalese  farmers  are  constrained  by  the  high  costs  of  chemical  fertilizer  and 
sometimes lack accessibility at the right time (Krupnik 2012). This is also a matter of low recovery 
rates of applied nutrients; e.g. farmers apply too high quantities, at an suboptimal time in the 
growing stages of the rice plants and mode of applications (Haefele, 2002). Practices to replace, 
reduce  and/or  complement  chemical  fertilizers  are  recommended.  For  instance,  the  use  of 
organic  and  alternative  inputs,  such  as  green  manure,  could  reduce  the  need  for  chemical 
fertilizers.  Alternatives include:  

• 

Increase optimization and recovery of applied (chemical) fertilizer. Fertilizer applications 
that are too high and not applied at the critical stages of plant growth will result in low 
recovery rates. This will cause not only run-off, followed by its negative impacts, it will 
also result in lower yields. Fertilizer application is recommended to be done in 2 or 3 splits 
at the planting stage, early tillering stage and panicle initiation stage. Also the dosage is 
key to efficient application of fertilizer (Haefele, 2002). A tool has been developed, which 
is called ‘RiceAdvice’ which can advice farmers in the recommended dosage and timing 
of fertilizer. 

•  Green  manure  applications.  Although  Green  Manure  incorporation  is  thought  to  incur 
high costs of labor, costs of fertilizer purchase and application can be higher and therefore 
less accessible for African smallholder farmers. Hence, farmers can benefit from the use 
of GM, yet specific numbers on costs are not available. This is explored more thoroughly 
below. 

•  The  application  of  Azolla  could  possibly  reduce  fertilizer  use;  however,  yields  will  only 
remain high when applying at least 60 kg N ha-1. (Bogdanski et al. 2016).  If Azolla was 
substituted for ammonium sulfate, nearly all of the money required to purchase the 300 
kg of ammonium sulfate fertilizer could theoretically be used to pay farm labor to grow 
azolla, or to gain a greater return on family labor (Lumpkin & Pluecknett 1985). 

•  The use of rice straw amendments to add Nitrogen (N) to rice fields.  
•  Urea Deep Placement (UDP): Granules or briquettes are made of urea and applied to or 

within the soil just after transplantation of rice. The briquettes are placed close to the 
roots (Bogdanksi et al. 2016).  This practice also serves to mitigate Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) emission from fertilizer application. There may be additional labor or capital costs 
associated with this technology (AfricaRice, pers. comm.) 
•  Residue management: explored more thoroughly below. 

Green manure details:  Ndoye et al. (1996) and Rinaudo et al. (1983) both studied the input of 
Green Manure (GM) Sesbania rostrata on rice yield. Rinaudo et al. (1983) argued that S. rostrata 

 

44 

as green manure showed to be a suitable substitute for chemical N fertilization, as they found 
significant increases yield using GM (571 g m-2) compared to the N fertilizer input of 60 kg ha-1 
(381 g m-2). Ndoye et al. (1996) compared the input of the GM with a mineral fertilizer input of 
92 kg ha-1 on one site and 105 kg ha-1 on another site in Senegal. Yields under the GM system 
were significantly higher, with no chemical fertilizer input. In Fangote, the average yield over 
seven years under GM was 3.9 Megagram per hectare (Mg ha-1), compared to 2.0 Mg ha-1 with 
fertilizer input. In Oussouye the average over 6 years under GM was 4.1 Mg ha-1, compared to 
2.1 Mg ha-1 with fertilizer input (Bogdanski et al. 2016).  Although Green Manure incorporation 
is thought to incur high costs of labor, costs of fertilizer purchase and application can be higher 
and therefore less accessible for African smallholder farmers. Hence, farmers can benefit from 
the use of GM, yet specific numbers on costs are not available (Ndoye et al. 1996).  
 
Azolla  details:  Riara  et  al.  (1987)  studied  the  effect  of  Azolla  crops  on  yields  in  irrigated  rice 
cultivation.  One  Azolla  crop  is  equivalent  to  30  kg  N  ha-1.  The  highest  yield  was  found  for  a 
combination of fertilizer input and Azolla (60 kg N ha-1 + 2 Azolla crops gives 8 t/ha), then for an 
application of 120 kg N ha-1 (gives 7.2 t ha-1) and third when implementing 4 Azolla crops (5.9 t 
ha-1). Azolla could possibly reduce fertilizer use, however, as the results show: yields will only 
remain high when applying at least 60 kg N ha-1. Ndoye et al. (1996) also considered the high 
labor  costs  of  Azolla  implementation,  which  could  double  the  costs  of  labor.  Azolla  is  a  fast 
growing  aquatic  pteridophyte  which  fixes  atmospheric  Nitrogen  by  forming  a  symbiotic 
association with the Blue-Green Algae, Anabaena azollae. Azolla is an efficient Nitrogen fixer. It 
is grown in lowland rice fields because flooded habitat is suitable for it. Under favorable field 
condition,  it  fixes  atmospheric  nitrogen  at  a  rate  exceeding  that  of  the  Legume-Rhizobium 
symbiotic relationship. It increases the rice yield equivalent to that produced by 30-60 kg N/ha. 
As green manure in water logged soil, it enhances the rapid mineralization of nitrogen. It reduces 
the  NH3  volatilization  losses  through  its  influence  on  floodwater  pH  that  leads  to  the 
conservation of urea-N in the system to improve the efficiency of N fertilizers. It significantly 
improves the physical and chemical properties of the soil including improvement in soil microbial 
activities.  It  helps  in  addition  of  Organic  Matter  and  release  of  cations  such  as  Magnesium, 
Calcium and Sodium. The total N, available P and exchangeable K in the soil and N-uptake by rice 
can be improved. Therefore, Azolla application is considered as a good practice for sustaining 
soil fertility and crop productivity irrespective of some limitations. (Subedi & Shrestha 2015) 

Externalities Runoff of nutrients, especially phosphorus, leading to eutrophication causing taste 
and odour in public water supply, excess algae growth leading to de-oxygenation of water and 
fish  kills.    Leaching  of  nitrate  to  groundwater;  excessive  levels  are  a  threat  to  public  health.  
Specific to Senegal: In the lower Senegal River Delta region, there is a rapid expansion of irrigated 
rice  cultivation.  There  is  an  increased  input  of  nutrients  into  water  systems  causing 

 

45 

environmental  damage  by  eutrophication.  Blooms  of  phytoplankton  (including  cyanobacteria) 
are widespread, mainly caused by phosphorous (P) inputs (in combination with environmental 
factors, like changes in light and temperature). Lakes and tributaries along the Senegal River are 
subject to these P in-puts, while they are used by the local populations as freshwater supplies 
(for example as drinking water for the capital Dakar) (Quiblier et al. 2008). 

Irrigated rice production - fertilizer management practices issues from a civil society perspective: 
Producers  forced  to  use  certified  rice  seed  often  face  situations  of  limited  access  to  the 
recommended mineral fertilizers, as the latter are generally not sufficiently available in sufficient 
quantities, especially for urea. Therefore, the recommended spreading schedule is not respected, 
and the applied rates are generally not sufficient. As a result, many unfortunate producers end 
up with very low yields because the use of organic amendments and the introduction of legumes 
are not part of their fertilization practices. 

Proposed policy response: Reduce mineral fertilizer and increase natural fertilizer use (e.g. soil 
fertility enhancement) (see also synergy) 

-  Increase of natural fertilizer use (by increasing subsidies, encourage producers to produce, 
collect and market their own natural fertilizers supporting the implementation of alternative 
approaches (such as the use of organic fertilizer derived from the Non-Sewerage Sanitation 
System along the fecal sludge Management treatment facilities) and training on its production, 
see training on SLM) 

Decrease of mineral fertilizer use (by decreasing subsidies) 

4.10. Irrigated rice production - Residue management 
 
Current status:  After harvest of the rice grains, rice straw remains in the field as residue. In the 
Senegal River Valley, 80 percent of the rice straw residues are burned. A reason for the burning 
of rice straw is that cattle are wandering around rice fields, releasing their dung in the fields. As 
dung contains seeds, cattle are seen as a major vector for dissemination of wild rice (which is 
considered as weed). Straw residues are burned, so cattle do  not spend too much time in the 
field grazing on these residues. The remaining 20 percent of the rice straw residues are either fed 
to  animals  or  buried  in  the  field  as  fertilizer.  A  different  situation  happens  in  the  Casamance 
region, where almost no rice straw is burned. The residues are either left in the field for grazing 
or the straw is buried to improve soil fertility. Burning rice straw in the field can emit substantial 
amounts of air pollutants, which has a negative impact on the environment and human health 
(Bogdanski et al. 2016).  
 

 

46 

Irrigated  rice  production  –  residue  management  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective:  Soil 
fertility  (soil  nutrient  level  as  well  as  SOM  and  SOC)  could  be  improved  by  leaving  rice  straw 
residues in the field, resulting in a potential yield increase (Haefele et al. 2004). Rice cropping 
systems in Senegal are becoming more and more intensive. Yields have not reached optimum 
quantities and in general in West Africa yields are even decreasing due to, among other things, a 
decrease in soil organic carbon (SOC). Decomposition of the residues in flooded rice systems in 
Senegal results in increasing SOC status. However, Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (methane 
and nitrous oxide) increase when rice straw is incorporated in the soil compared to fields without 
rice straw amendments (Bogdanski et al. 2016). 
 
Rice crop residues could be used as feed for animals. In times of drought, biomass may be very 
limited and nutrition is a major concern in cattle production in Senegal. All rice residues fed to 
livestock compete with soil fertility. However, synergies are found between soil residues fed to 
cows and food production as well. Livestock production seems to increase (milk, beef) as well as 
productivity during ploughing time (more hours of work per day). In addition, the quality and 
quantity of dung improves which as well can be added to the field again to improve soil fertility. 
This system is usually only viable however, when farmers have both crops and livestock.  
 
Alternatively, farmers could use rice straw for energy. Households in Senegal highly depend on 
biomass energy. A trade-off needs to be considered between the use of rice residues to improve 
soil fertility, animal food or to use it as a source of biomass energy. In depth research is needed 
to see the amount of field residues which could potentially be removed without affecting soil 
fertility. In addition, currently rice husks are used as biomass energy. Many Africans households 
lack access to energy. Up to 90 percent of households in Senegal use biomass fuels, such as fuel 
wood or residues, as source of energy (UNEP RISO 2013). Under certain circumstances, rice husks 
and straw could be used as an energy source (Alesbury 2013), for instance as green charcoal as 
suggested in the pilot study done by the International Biochar Initiative (n.d.). These studies refer 
to pilot projects however and are not readily being employed in the country.  There is no evidence 
that rice straw is used as energy source in Senegal (Bogdanski et al. 2016) 

Irrigated rice production - residue management practices issues from a civil society perspective: 
Community management rules, if adopted, could result in a better valuation of harvest residues. 

Proposed policy response:  Support the implementation of the land use and development plans 
(POAS) already designed. 

Support local initiatives for better management of agro-pastoral areas with a view to better 
integration of agriculture-livestock systems, in order to better valorization of crop residues. 

 

47 

4.11. Irrigated rice production - Management of greenhouse gas emissions 
 
Current status:  In Senegal, the emission of methane and nitrous oxide gases from lowland rice 
production  is  one  of  the  contributors  to  global  climate  change.  The  major  GHG  emissions  in 
Senegal are Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O). Total GHG emissions 
(CO2, CH4 and N2O) per year from agriculture in Senegal were approximately 186 Gigagram (Gg) 
in 1991, of which methane emissions in rice contributed 58.7 Gg. Hence, rice counted for 31.5 
percent  of  total  GHG  emissions  (CO2,  CH4  and  N2O)  in  agriculture  in  Senegal.  Total  methane 
emissions  from  agriculture  in  Senegal  were  142.9  Gg,  so  rice  contributed  over  40  percent  of 
methane emission, at the time of this calculation (Bogdanski et al. 2016) 
 
Irrigated  rice  production  –  management  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  a  researcher 
perspective: Several farm management practices in rice fields influence GHG emissions. Rice in 
Senegal is mainly grown under flooded conditions (de Vries et al. 2010). Methane is produced 
under these anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils and consequently wetlands (like rice fields) 
are the major sources of methane production. Methane production and emission in cultivated 
wetlands  (mainly  rice  fields)  increases  by  submersion  and  rice  straw  residue  incorporation 
(organic  matter  addition)  (Le  Mer  &  Roger  2001).  Yet,  it  should be  recognized that  rice  straw 
burning emits GHGs as well, increasing air pollution (Gaihre et al. 2013). Addition of N by organic 
or mineral fertilizer has also an impact on GHG emissions as it mainly increases N2O emissions 
from the soil (Velthof et al. 2002).  
 
Measures to mitigate greenhouse gases in Senegal rice production systems include: 

1.  Urea  Deep  Placement  (UDP)  reduces  GHGs  emissions  compared  to  conventional 
application of urea in flooded rice fields. In addition, rice yields seem to increase as well 
under  UDP.  Exact  numbers  of  this  practice  in  Senegal  are  not  available,  but  the  data 
available from other West-African countries showing a synergy between climate change 
mitigation and food production when using UDP.  

2.  Alternate wetting and drying, in which rice fields are not permanently flooded, reduces 
methane emissions from rice fields. Over-drying could cause drought stress to rice plants 
and dry conditions increases weed competition. However, de Vries et al. (2010) concluded 
that alternate wetting and drying is possible in Senegal with little or no yield reduction. In 
this case, climate change mitigation will increase while food production is sustained.  

3.  Under the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) fewer fertilizers are used and rice fields are 
not  permanently  flooded.  This  results  in  lower  methane  emission,  but  nitrous  oxide 
emissions  could  be  higher.  Yields  will  increase  under  SRI  practices.  Green  manure 
amendments  (used  in  SRI)  –  especially  with  high  levels  of  C  –  increase  methane 

 

48 

production. Site-specific research is needed to see whether there is a negative impact of 
SRI on GHGs emissions in Senegal.  

 
Straw  incorporation  is  a  common  long-term  practice  to  improve  soil  fertility  in  croplands 
worldwide.  However,  straw  amendments  often  increase  methane  (CH4)  emissions  from  rice 
paddies,  one  of  the  main  sources  of  anthropogenic  CH4.  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate 
Change (IPCC) methodologies to estimate CH4 emissions from rice agriculture assume that the 
effect of straw addition remains constant over time. 
 
Recent  research  results  (Jiang  et  al.  2019)  suggest  that  model  projections  may  have 
overestimated  CH4  emissions  from  rice  agriculture  and  that  CH4  emission  estimates  can  be 
improved by considering the duration of straw incorporation and other management practices 
(Jiang et al. 2019)

and drying, scaling up among family farmers. 

-  Popularise and disseminate the technique of alternating wetting and drying in irrigated 

rice growing basins. 

4.12. Irrigated rice production - Pest and weed management 
 
Current  status:  Rice  cultivation  systems  in  Senegal,  like  elsewhere,  face  damage  by pests  and 
diseases.  The  conventional  approach  to  suppress  pests  is  the  use  of  pesticides  (insecticides, 
fungicides, herbicides), even though the positive effect of insecticides on rice yields is not proven 
according to Settle et al. (1996). The quantities of pesticides used in Senegal, on all crops, has 
risen  considerable  over the  last  decades  (Figure  6).    Over  the  past  15  years  pesticide  use per 
hectare in the Senegal River Delta alone has increased four to fivefold, while the area under rice 
cultivation  has  only  doubled.  Jepson  et  al.  (2014)  outlined  an  approach  to  pesticide  risk 
assessment in West Africa, which found that in Senegal in 2007 and in 2010, no irrigated rice 
perimeters met acceptable levels of pesticide risk to both human and wildlife health.

Irrigated  rice  production  -  pest  and  weed  management  practices  issues  from  a  researcher 
perspective:  There is very limited damage by insects on rice plants in Senegal, such as stemborers 
(Settle  &  Garba  2011).  The  biggest  current  challenges  are  weeds  and  birds  (Rodenburg  et  al. 
2014).  Pesticides may be over- and misused in Senegal (IW:LEARN, n.d.). Through pollution of 
the  Senegal  River watershed,  by  spraying pesticides without  protection and  by  eating  treated 
rice, these pesticides may also have dangerous impacts on human health and biodiversity.   

A noted above, the positive effect of insecticides on rice yields is not proven (Settle et al. 1996; 
Settle  &  Garba  2011).  Problems  caused  by  insect  pests,  such  as  stemborers,  appear  relatively 
limited  in  West  Africa  (Settle  &  Garba,  2011).  Weeds,  on  the  other  hand,  do  cause  major 
problems in rice cultivation, affecting rice yields (Labrada 2003; Ongley 1996).  De Vries  et al. 
(2010)  showed  a  significant  increase  in  yield  when  using  herbicides  to  control  weeds  in  rice 

 

50 

cultivation in two sites in Senegal. They found an increase in rice yield in the wet season of 2.8 t 
ha-1 (146%) and an increase of 4.4 t ha-1 (215%) in the dry season under flooded conditions.   

However, the application of herbicides (and any pesticides) do tend to have clear impacts. The of 
agrochemicals  leads  to  contamination  of  surface  water  and  biota;  dysfunction  of  ecological 
system  in  surface  waters  by  loss  of  top  predators  due  to  growth  inhibition  and  reproductive 
failure; public health impacts from eating contaminated fish. Pesticides are carried as dust by 
wind  over  very  long  distances  and  contaminate  aquatic  systems  1000s  of  miles  away  (e.g. 
tropical/subtropical  pesticides  found  in  Arctic  mammals).  Some  pesticides  may  leach  into 
groundwater causing human health problems from contaminated wells. 

Residue  analysis  showed  that  detectable  quantities  of  pesticides  enter  villages  in  Northern 
Senegal through  irrigation  channels  and drains.  Applications  of  the  pesticide  Carbofuran  have 
been commonly used in rice production systems in Senegal, to control stem borers (even if not 
needed, or effective). This pesticide is known for its hazardous effects on non-target species who 
use  rice  fields  as  (feeding)  habitat,  such  as  fish,  frogs,  wildlife, 
invertebrates  and 
macroinvertebrates – and also impacting the birds who feed on them. Research has shown that 
the exclusion of Carbofuran use in rice fields increases on average the biomass of aquatic micro 
invertebrate per hectares by 444% (Mullie et al. 1991).  

Various  alternative  management  practices  have  the  potential  to  decrease  pesticide  use,  in 
particular the use of herbicides. The best biological control alternatives to herbicides appears to 
be not to apply alternative biologically-sourced toxins, but to improve plant nutrition, such as 
through Azolla  fertilizers.    Thus,  some  management practices to  control weed  in  rice  fields  in 
Senegal that have been commonly identified include (Bogdanski et al. 2016):  

(1)  An increased rice plant density, a rice crop with a more rapid crop canopy closure or a 

more competitive rice cultivar to reduce the weed;  

(2)  A manual weeding treatment combined with Azolla always increases yields, while 

decreasing weed biomass. Yields even pass yields of only herbicide use (although this 
difference is not proved to be significant at 5 percent).  

(3)  No weeding only using Azolla gives a significant increase of rice yield of1.7 tons per 

hectare compared to a system without Azolla and no weeding. 

To reduce pesticide use, while limiting the damage by insects, the Integrated Production and Pest 
Management  (IPPM)  project  has  been  carried  out  in  Senegal.  In  this  program  sustainable 
intensification is promoted by the use of Farmer Field Schools (FFS). Farmers build new skills and 
knowledge to increase yields by using ecological methods. The program helps farmers to modify 
and  adapt  their  own  set  of  good  farming  practices.  This  is  mainly  done  by  showing  field 

 

51 

experiments, e.g. experiments on the influence of natural enemies on pests. Farmers build new 
skills and knowledge to increase yields by using ecological methods. Settle & Hama Garba (2009) 
stated that there are already over 5,000 hectares of rice land in Senegal under the IPPM program.  
After implementation of IPPM in rice cultivation in Senegal, pesticide use was reduced by 100 
percent (FAO 2008a and b). In addition, the yield increased by almost a quarter under the IPPM 
project compared to the conventional system (pesticide use).  
 
There is not as yet a solid way of accounting for the cost of pesticide externalities, although a 
good model has been provided by a study of pesticide externalities in Thailand (Table 3). Some 
sources of information for carrying out such studies on rice in Senegal include a study on the 
externalities from pesticides (from desert locust spraying in 2003-2005 in Senegal (Leach et al. 
2015), using the same detailed Pesticide Environment Accounting system as used in the Thailand 
study (Leach & Mumford 2008). It provides a potential approach for assessing the externalities 
of pesticides applied to rice in Senegal, should the resources exist to do so.  With respect to rice, 
a study carried on negative externalities in rice production systems applied contingent valuation 
to assess the costs of a range of externalities for rice in the Philippines (Cuyno et al. 2001). Within 
Africa,  Maumbe  &  Swinton  (2003)  assessed  the  costs  of  health  impacts  from  pesticide 
applications  in  cotton  production  in  Zimbabwe,  as  did  Ajayi  et  al.  (2011)  among  smallholder 
farmers in the cotton  zones of Côte d'Ivoire. These approaches could serve as templates for an 
assessment of pesticide externalities in rice systems in Senegal.

4.13. Rice production - Addressing salinization 

Current  status:  In  several  parts of  Senegal  rice cultivation is  threatened  by salinization, which 
mainly occurs in the Senegal River Valley. Farmers often dry-till their soil and thereafter irrigation-
drainage cycles are applied to flush the salts out of the field. To further remove salts from the 
field some farmers apply puddling. Puddling refers to tillage while the soil is flooded. Puddling is 
combined with irrigation-drainage cycles as well (Bogdanski et al. 2016).  

Rice production – addressing salinization issues from a researcher perspective: Rice production 
in Senegal can be severely affected by saltwater intrusion, especially in the Senegal River Valley. 
Salts end up in the topsoil from saline groundwater when the rice field is not cultivated (capillary 
rise)  and  additional  salts  are  added  through  the  irrigation  water.  In  addition,  under  flooded 
conditions the salts are dissolved and transported downwards from the topsoil. In general, rice 
plants  are  able  to  survive  under  certain  saline  and  flooded  conditions,  yet  rice  production  is 
threatened and limited by high levels of soil salinity.  Many farmers dry till their fields and to 
wash  out  the  salts  from  the  soil,  farmers  flush  their  rice  fields  with  fresh  water.  The  results 
showed that puddling decreased the soil salinity level significantly. If rice fields are not flushed, 
eventually fields have to be abandoned due to high salt content of the soil (Raes et al. 1995). 
Though, two trade-offs need to be taken into account. First of all, the salt content in the drainage 
water was in the first three drainage cycles (after puddling) three to eight times higher for the 
puddling  compared  to  the  baseline  treatment.  Secondly,  data  on  yield  was  not  given  in  the 
research,  yet  rice  seed  establishment  was  poor  in  the  puddling  system  (Hafele  et  al.  1999; 
Bogdanski et al. 2016).

It is noted that salt tolerant varieties are becoming available (AfricaRice, pers. comm.) 

Rice  production  –  addressing  salinization  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  Same 
perspectives as provided in the "water management" section.  

Irrigated rice production- mechanization 

Current status: In 2004, there were 645 tractors in Senegal; so, the baseline at present is close to 
zero. (AUC/FAO 2017; Mrema et al. 2017). The need for greater agricultural equipment has been 
expressed from many perspectives.  It is critical, however, to understand where the demands for 
greater mechanization currently apply, as discussed below. 

Irrigated  rice  production-  mechanization  issues  from  a  farmer  perspective:  In  traditional  rice 
fields,  small  tillers  or  polycultures  are  needed.  They  must  be  of  human  dimension  so  that  an 
average peasant family can acquire / manage them. 

Irrigated  rice  production-  mechanization  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective:  As  currently 
undertaken, crop establishment in irrigated rice in Senegal involves limited mechanization.  There 
is for instance machinery available for mechanical weeding (Rodenburg & Johnson, 2013). Also, 
hydro  tillers are  used for  wet tillage  to flush  out  salts  from  irrigated  rice  fields  (Haefele  et  al. 
1999). 

A  focus  on  mechanization  in  rice  production  concentrates  on  harvesting  and  post-production 
stages.  Traditionally  rice  is  harvested  manually  with  a  knife,  which  is  very  labour  intensive. 
Advocates for rice agribusiness argue for providing farmers with access to agricultural equipment 
for harvest and postharvest activities, oriented toward commercial large-scale production.  Also, 
the possibility of increasing rice yields in the Senegal River Valley through double rice cropping, 
would be very much dependent on machinery availability (combine harvester and tractor). The 
number of such machines are limited; and the scope for maintenance is a major constraint.  Once 
broken, they cannot be easily repaired locally, as most of the machines are imported with no 
spare parts. (Brosseau et al. 2018) 

In the Casamance area of Senegal, the smallholder traditional rice systems suffer from severe 
labor shortages as young men and women leave the countryside to find work in the cities.  Linares 
(2009) notes that:  

“If Jola rice-growing systems are to avoid stagnation or gradual decline, serious 
efforts need to be made to mechanize agriculture. Unfortunately, however, this 

 

54 

enormous task would require substantial financial and technical inputs that are well 
beyond the reach of the Senegalese state.” 

Thus  for  both  conventional  and  agroecological  rice  systems,  there  is  a  need  for  greater 
investment in appropriate mechanization.   

Irrigated  rice  production  -  mechanization  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  Despite  the 
development and supervision of rice growing areas by development projects, the introduction of 
heavy equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters to support rice growing development 
has not been as successful as expected. Indeed, in most rice growing areas, tillage, harvesting 
activities are still not mechanized due to the high cost of maintaining equipment that is difficult 
for promoters and producer organisations to bear.  

It should just be noted that even when there is a sufficient quantity and diversity of agricultural 
equipment  available  in  rice  production  area,  producers  do  not  always  use  the  services  of 
machinery providers for economic reasons.  

Proposed policy response: There is a need for greater investment in appropriate mechanization.  
In particular, farmers should be provided with access to agricultural equipment for harvest and 
postharvest  activities.    For  agroecological  farmers,  this  equipment  should  be  developed  and 
scaled  toward  the  needs  small  scale  producers,  such  as  small  tillers  or  harvesters  for  use  in 
traditional/small-scale  rice  fields.  Given  the  challenge  of  the  cost  of  mechanization,  greater 
support  is  needed  to  enable  farmers’  organizations  to  invest  together  in  machinery,  and  for 
private contractors to be able to rent and repair these. 

4.14. Rice production - Inputs and subsidies 

Current  status:  Subsidies  for  inputs  such  as  fertilizer,  seed,  machinery,  and  fuel  have  been  a 
mainstay in agricultural development in Senegal since 2004. The amount of subsidies provided 
has expanded as well, increasing from 75 million in 2001 to 36 billion ten years later (Seck 2015).  
The subsidies have been credited with  enhancing productivity in groundnuts, millet, sorghum, 
and  maize,  but  not  rice  particularly  (GFC  website).  Development  of  a  coherent  input  subsidy 
policy  is  greatly  needed.  Most  of  fertilizers  have  been  subsidized  at  50  percent,  meaning  the 
government pays for 50 percent of the farmer’s fertilizers through government-approved and 
registered tenders and the farmer purchases the remainder of their fertilizer through the private 
market  (Bumb  et  al.  2011).  Farmers  are  responsible  for  obtaining  their  fertilizer  from  the 
suppliers’ warehouses, and 80 percent of the fertilizers on the market are government-approved 
tenders  (ibid).  The  total  subsides  for  Senegal  is  72.6  million  US  dollars,  where  8.3  %  ($  6.03 
million) is allocated for all types of seeds. (Seck 2015). 

 

55 

Irrigated  rice  production  -  inputs  and  subsidies  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective:  An 
agroecological approach to subsidies would be to recognize the value of investment in farmers, 
but  to  phase  out  subsidies  for  agrochemical  inputs  and  reorient  these  resources  to  support 
farmer-to-farmer  training,  farmer  researcher  networks  and  training  on  agroecological  farm 
management.  Such a reorientation could contribute substantively to increased employment in 
green  industries  around  agroecological  rice:    seed  banks,  green  manure  production,  rental  of 
small-scale machinery for harvesting and threshing, community-owned rice mills. 

Irrigated rice production - inputs and subsidies issues from a civil society perspective: One of the 
major handicaps is undoubtedly the availability of appropriate inputs at the needed time (with 
respect to the crop calendar) and accessibility of fertilizers (high prices), more particularly Urea. 

Proposed  policy  response:    Development  of  a  coherent  input  subsidy  policy  that  fosters 
agroecological approaches and regenerative rather than high-input agriculture 

Or abolish the subsidy for chemical fertilizers and leave it to private operators and the market to 
make the necessary trade-offs. The State, through its decentralized structures, would then be 
more useful as a market regulator and a control body for fertilizer distribution channels. 

4.15. Rice production - Agricultural credit 

Current  status:  Currently,  systems  of  agricultural  credit  are  limited,  and  through  short  credit 
duration lead to a “vicious cycle” of “short pay-back to finance service > delayed credit attribution 
> delayed planting > delayed harvesting > delayed pay-back to finance service, etc. (Brousseau et 
al.  2018).    Such  delays  in  credit  have  many  knock-on  effects,  including  delayed  sowing,  and 
reduced yields (Tanaka et al. 2018). 

Irrigated rice production - agricultural credit issues from a farmer perspective: For agroecological 
rice production, credit is non-existent in Senegal. Farmers' organizations must work with financial 
institutions such as the “Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole” and other micro finance institutions 
to draw- up credit lines for the benefit of producers or traders of agroecological products only. 

While majority of family farmers produce food primarily for home consumption, yet they struggle 
to market the little surpluses that they have. There aren’t any niche markets for agroecological 
produce. In the absence of facilities for storage facilities and capacities to add value, farmers are 
forced to sell their produce in the local markets with low returns. Specialised (organic) and distant 
markets  insist  on  value addition  and  certification,  that are beyond the affordability  of  a  small 
farmer.  Thus agricultural credit could make a large difference in facilitating storage facilities and 
value-added enterprises. 

 

56 

Irrigated  rice  production  -  agricultural  credit  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective:    A  study 
analyzing the rice value chain in Senegal sought to identify if is structured to implement technical 
changes and integrate new functions, leading to increased value added, as rice value chains in 
Asia have often done (Soullier 2017).  The study found that while many aspects of the Senegalese 
value  chain  are  in  step with what  is  taking  place  in Asia, a  significant  difference  is  tied  to the 
absence  of  credit.  In  Senegal,  many  of  the  transactions  along  the  rice  value  chain  are  “spot 
transactions”.  When farmers participate in contracts, they do so to secure agricultural financing, 
in credit markets where such financing is not obtainable due to the indebtedness of small-scale 
producers  to  the  national  agriculture  bank.  Two  types  of  contracts  are  common-  production 
contracts  and  marketing  contracts.  The  impacts  of  such  contracts  on  small  scale  farmers  are 
different.  The production contract has a positive impact on the income of producers who were 
excluded from bank credit. It nevertheless includes implicit interest and insurance costs, meaning 
that these producers make less profit than those financed by the bank. The marketing contract 
is  a financial device  which  has  no  impact  on  agricultural practices,  yields,  product quality and 
income. It nevertheless slightly improves food security by mitigating price seasonality. The study 
author calls for the design of an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit which should 
also include mechanization and address the needs of small-scale processors in the modernization 
through  the  promotion  of  semi-industrial  technics  and  the  opening  up  of  operating  and 
equipment loans. 
 
A special issue of LEISA India on Agroecological Value Chains (LEISA India 2018) outlines some of 
the  challenges  and  possibilities  of  building  safe,  sustainable  agroecological  value  chains  that 
ensure farmer prosperity. They describe the formation of farmer producer organizations in India 
that  assist  farmers  with  sustainable  production  methods  and  work  together  to  add  value  by 
grading  and  branding.    Farmers  working  together  have  been  able  to  collectively  market  their 
products and enhance their bargaining power.  Similar initiatives have and can be initiated and 
encouraged on rice value chains in Senegal, possibly through infusions of agricultural credit. 

Irrigated  rice  production  -  agricultural  credit  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  Irrigated 
agriculture as carried out by small scale and family farmers in the Senegal River Valley does not 
receive  enough  medium-term  agricultural  credit.  There  is  a  lack  of  optimal  support  for  the 
investment needs of farmers and businesses over a period of time that meets the requirements 
of irrigated agriculture. This is largely due to the fact that demand is mainly for short-term needs, 
yet short- and medium-term credit is hard to obtain.  Private investment in credit institutions is 
extremely limited due to the existing structures and systems.  

The dominant element of the production system in the valley is still the subsistence family farm. 
The agricultural sector is primarily subsistence and marginally commercial, where accumulation 

 

57 

is insignificant. Presently this sector constitutes the basis of basic food production and the basis 
for the emergence of individual agricultural enterprises since they hold most of the land allocated.  
Existing credit institutions are not serving this sector effectively. 

Proposed  policy  response:  There  is  an  urgent  need  for  the  State  to  clearly  define  the  type  of 
agriculture it intends to develop at the national level, and to confirm that in the Senegal River 
valley agricultural development should proceed through the  normal stages of a self-sufficient 
family agriculture before trying to institutionalize the industrial agriculture model advocated by 
the structural adjustment programmes. Credit structures should support family farmers and their 
entrepreneurial aspirations. 

The relevance of the rice systems set up in the context of large dam projects must be questioned, 
since  they  have  very  high  production  costs  and  only  offer  low  incomes.  There  is  insufficient 
thought on alternatives to the technical packages prescribed by the development offices, while 
options  exist  that  could  reduce  production  costs  and  should  be  tested  locally.  These  include 
improving  plot  fertility  management  (organic  manure,  limestone,  green  manure),  hydraulic 
control (water blade management), better equipment for producers for cultivation, harvesting 
and post-harvest, and reducing irrigation costs.  

Support financial organizations to extend credit and micro-credit to provide preferential terms 
to  producers  or  traders of  agroecological  products,  and  other  producers or  traders otherwise 
contributing  to  resilience.    Particular  areas  needing  support  are  for  mechanization,  storage 
facilities, and processing capabilities. 

4.16. Diversification, integration of fish with rice 

Current status:  Over 90% of the world’s rice is grown under flooded conditions, providing an 
environment not solely for the crop alone but also for wide range of aquatic organisms.  Many 
rural households depend on monotonous diets that are too high in carbohydrates and too low in 
animal source foods and micronutrient-rich fruits, fish and vegetables. Access to a diversified diet 
is  often  constrained  by  lack  of  purchasing  power,  limited  expertise  and  limited  availability. 
Experience  has  shown  that  more  diversified  farming  systems  that  contain  horticultural  or 
aquacultural  components  are  one way  to  improve  households’  availability and  access  to  such 
animal source foods, fruits and vegetables. While high external input production systems, usually 
monocultures,  may  increase  rice  yield  (compared  to  more  diverse,  yet  lower  external  input 
systems), they bear the risk to lead to monotonous diets that are high in carbohydrates and low 
in  animal  source  foods  and  micronutrient-rich  fruits,  fish  and  vegetables  (trade-off).  More 
diverse, yet less external input systems may lead to higher dietary diversity and better nutrition, 
with potential trade-offs in yields of rice- but also potential synergies for increased yields. 

 

58 

Diversification  may  occur  along  many  lines;  two  that  we  consider  below  are  integration  of 
vegetables, and incorporation of fish in rice paddies. 

Irrigated rice production - diversification, integration of fish with rice issues from a researcher 
perspective:  
 
Diversification with vegetables: in a case study exploring trade-offs and synergies for improving 
irrigated  rice  systems  in  the  Senegal  River  Valley  (Brouseau  et  al.  2018)  many  farmers  have 
desired crop diversification through the integration of (more) vegetables, with the hope that this 
could  lead  to  greater  income,  less  risks  and  increased  food  security.  However,  vegetable 
cultivation posed a potential risk to the objective of households to be self-sufficient in rice, since 
rice and vegetable cropping calendars could overlap, with both occurring between the end of the 
cool  dry  season  and  the  start  in  the  hot  dry  season.  Other  constraints  included  credit 
arrangements, and small land sizes. A simulation of possible farmer decisions showed indicated 
the following trade-offs in the Senegal River Valley, farm profit can be increased with reduced 
household  leisure  time  and  increased  N  losses,  and  rice  production  could  be  increased  by 
cultivating rice in the hot dry season in the fields currently dedicated to vegetables. The latter 
option can reduce farm profit and N  loss but increase household leisure time (Brouseau et al. 
2018).  
 
Fish-rice integration: In a careful review of the literature, Halwart & Gupta (2004) documented 
fish  production  yields  in  rice-fish  systems  all  over  the  world.  The  analysis  demonstrates  that, 
although higher rice yields were not always obtained with the introduction of fish, the majority 
(80%) resulted in higher yields of 2.5% or more, and a significant contribution of fish protein to 
farmers’ diets.   
 
Efforts to integrate fish with rice in the Casamance region of Senegal have shown considerable 
promise (Petersen et al. 2006) In the rice culture zones of Senegal, environmental changes have 
caused some rice farmers to diversify and integrate fish culture in their farming operations.  As 
described by Diallo (1998):  

“After two decades of drought, mangrove areas on the foreshore have expanded and surface 
and groundwaters have become increasingly salinized.  To protect their rice fields against 
the inflow of saltwater, farmers built fishponds along the foreshore area to produce fish. The 
fishponds range from 500 to 5 000 m2 (30 cm deep with 1 m deep peripheral canal). During 
the first rain, the gates of the rice fields and fishponds are opened to allow the rainwater to 
wash away any salt that may have accumulated. Then the gates are closed and the rainwater 
and surface runoff are collected for both the rice planting and fish growing operations. After 
the  rice  has  been  planted  from  mid-August  to  mid-September,  the  seaward  gates  are 

 

59 

opened during the spring tides. Coastal fish attracted by the flow of freshwater come into 
the ponds and are trapped. No attempt is made to control the species and the number of 
fish that enter. The rice fields and fishponds are fertilized with cattle and pig manure and 
ash. The fish are fed rice bran, millet bran and sometimes termites. The fish are harvested 
either  when  the  rice  is  about  to  mature  or  just  after  the  rice  has  been  harvested  from 
December to January, when the fish have been growing from 120 to 150 days. Harvesting is 
done during low tide by draining the pond with a basket locally known in Senegal as “etolum” 
placed at the end of the drainpipe. In Basse Casamance, Senegal, rice–fish alternating with 
fish only culture results in fish yields ranging between 963-1 676 kg· ha-1 in ponds fertilized 
with animal manure and fed farm by-products, and 590 kg· ha-1 from the rice field.” 

Irrigated rice production - diversification, integration of fish with rice issues from a civil society 
perspective: 

The intensification of rice cultivation and the development of irrigated  diversified crops other 
than  rice  must  be  compatible:  on  the  one  hand  with  the  sustainability  of  cultivation  and 
production systems, and on the other hand with the preservation of natural resources.  

Care should be taken to ensure that the issue of intensification is addressed, as it will only be 
sustainable if it improves or maintains fertility in its broadest sense, paying particular attention 
to  ensuring  that  it  does  not  contribute  to  causing  or  accelerating  the  degradation  of  the 
environment. Hence, the relevance of rice and fish farming and the association of other crops in 
rice fields with a low water level (e. g. sorghum and some forage crops tolerating root asphyxia 
relatively better according to Saglio & Pradet 1983, Follin 1993).  These crops are unfortunately 
not well known to farmers. 

The constraints to diversification are many and varied depending on whether one is dealing with 
small  village  or  private  perimeters,  or  medium  to  large  perimeters.  Significant  challenges  are 
noted  in  the  diversification  of  crop  calendars,  technical  routes  and  water  management.  Crop 
calendar problems are very complex. The results of Amediane et al in 1993, in the specific case 
of small village perimeters, make it possible to classify constraints into five groups according to 
whether they are due to: production systems, types of irrigated perimeters, or macroeconomic, 
cultural or technical problems. Constraints to diversification can also be: insufficient farm size to 
achieve self-sufficiency, lack of available labour and, almost generally, lack of cash flow.  

However, the most serious constraints are neither climatic nor purely technical: they most often 
relate to the collective organisation of perimeters, access to credit and inputs, the poor state of 
pumping equipment, not to mention the existence of incentive or non-incentive sectors. Indeed, 
the  absence  of  attractive  diversification  channels  other  than  tomatoes  and  onions,  whose 

 

60 

markets  are  not  spread  over  a  long  period  of  time  and  are  saturated  too  quickly,  is  a  major 
constraint. 

Proposed policy response: The State must undertake guarantees of market outlets, prices and 
financing for diversification, which currently are too uncertain to allow farmers to take the risks 
of engaging in any farming systems in which  productivity remains uncertain until the harvest.  
This risk to farmers should be addressed by programmes that help farmers to face uncertainty. 

4.17. Rainfed lowland or upland rice production - General 
  
Current  status:  Rainfed  rice  systems  are  mainly  found  in  the  Casamance  region  (Kolda  and 
Ziguinchor regions), in the south of Senegal. Although 90 percent of the inhabitants of Senegal 
live  in  this  area,  and  the  region  covers  a  large  area  of  harvested  rice  in  Senegal  (over  75,000 
hectares), only 30 percent of the rice of Senegal is produced in this area. During the 2009 rainy 
season,  rainfed  rice  growing  occupied  72,000  ha,  representing  30%  of  national  production. 
Production,  harvesting,  and  processing  operations  in  rainfed  systems  are  done  manually  and 
mostly by women. Farmers generally lack access to seed of improved varieties, such as. NERICA 
(New Rice for Africa). Drought, weed infestation, and low soil fertility are major constraints in 
rainfed upland systems, with yields usually from 1 to 2 t/ha. In rainfed lowland systems, yields 
are usually clearly higher, up to 3 t/ha, because of more favorable soils and moisture conditions. 
Plots are small (<0.1 hectares) and rice production is extensive as low amounts of fertilizer are 
applied  and  no  herbicides  are  used.  Lowland  rainfed  rice  plots  are  seasonally  flooded,  while 
upland rainfed rice plots fully depend on rainfall (Wolfe et al. 2009). Seed is often difficult for 
farmers to obtain; farmers save seed for replanting but are not assisted to do so. Rainfed lowland 
or upland rice production is not a focus for commercial production/agribusiness. 

Rainfed lowland or upland rice production - general issues from a researcher perspective: The 
rainfed systems face challenges related to weed infestation, drought and low soil fertility. Most 
of the rice production in rainfed systems is done manually and often by women. Mechanization 
levels are low, pesticides are hardly used, and water management is difficult as water input is 
harder to control compared to irrigated rice systems and floods are easier taking place. Average 
yields are therefore quite lower compared to irrigated rice yields. 

Members of the research establishment have, in reference to GOANA program mentioned below, 
brought attentoned to the newer program PRACAS (2014) where rice is an important component 
(M. Diagne pers.comm.). 

Rainfed  lowland  or  upland  rice  production  -  general  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective: 
Salinisation is the most widespread problem in all lowland rainfed rice growing areas. The fight 

 

61 

against the chemical degradation of the land in the rice growing valleys of Casamance due to the 
rise of fluviomarine waters was carried out from the 1970s onwards with the implementation of 
several anti-salt dams that enabled the rehabilitation, defense and development of the several 
valleys located along the Casamance River and its tributaries. However, it should not be forgotten 
that  the  lowland  is  not  completely  isolated  from  the  hydrographic  network  and  that  the  salt 
water  table  circulating  under  the  anti-salt  dike  cannot  be  entirely  eliminated.  Therefore, 
maintaining  previously  rehabilitated  soils  is  particularly  difficult  in  the  driest  years,  when 
freshwater  meteorological  inputs  are  greatly  reduced.  Even  poor  water  management  or 
improper maintenance of structures can negatively affect the salt balance in the valley. 

This partly explains why, despite the various development aid actions that have addressed the 
problems of lowland rice cultivation since the 1960s, most of the socio-economic, environmental 
and technical limitations and bottlenecks that condition valley management have not found long-
term solutions, while there has been a marked decline in lowland rice cultivation in favour of 
upland rice, which, also thanks to the introduction of improved varieties (in particular upland 
NERICA varieties), has seen significant development in recent years (DRZ, 1999).  

However, it should not be forgotten that, after the launch of GOANA [Grande offensive pour la 
nourriture  et  l’abondance],  rainfed  rice  production  in  Senegal  achieved  significant  results, 
increasing  from  40,000  ha  to  about  80,000  ha  (+95%)  and  covering  30%  of  national  rice 
production in 2008 (PNAR 2009). This confirms the good development potential of rainfed rice in 
view of national food self-sufficiency objectives. 

Proposed policy response:  Development programmes must be designed to ensure that water 
flow, always in relation to desalination processes, is well controlled to prevent land upstream of 
the anti-salt dike from being denied water and, on the contrary, to prevent the land closest to 
the  dam  from  being  excessively  submerged.  This  therefore  requires  the  construction  of 
additional  infrastructures  (dikes)  to  retain  runoff  water  (surface  and  groundwater) to  slow  its 
movement,  maintain  an  optimal  water  level  for  rice  cultivation  by  regulating  its  height  or  to 
create water supply areas.  

The adoption of appropriate cultivation techniques is necessary to ensure salt mobilization and 
the improvement of physical and chemical soil fertility in lowland rice fields. Examples in 
agroecology include the use of manure and ploughing in ridges.  

At the same time, it is necessary to adopt measures to control erosion and subsequent silting of 
valleys on plateau and slope areas. These interventions may include the adoption of conservation 
agronomic techniques (e.g. ploughing and contour seeding, mulching, etc.), the construction of 
small structures (or buffer zones) to control water flows (half-moons, isohypsal hedges, stone 

 

62 

barriers, filter dikes, etc.) or larger-scale defensive measures in situations of major risk (e.g. if the 
slope is greater than 2%). All these efforts involve integrated actions at the territorial level to 
raise awareness and empower people to protect the land, both productively and naturally.  

The development of lowland rice cultivation also strictly depends on the capacity and willingness 
of  the  beneficiaries  to  organize  themselves  for  the  management  and  maintenance  of  the 
structures  (anti-salt  dam  and  related  developments).  In  this  respect,  water  control  must  be 
ensured  by  the  farmers  themselves  within  the  communities  of  the  villages  focused  on  the 
rehabilitated  valley  and  organized  into  a  management  and  monitoring  structure  (e.g.  valley 
committees). 

4.18. Import vs. domestic production 

Current status: Rice is Senegal’s staple crop, and since the 1980s, the country has emphasized 
rice  production  through  subsidies,  extension,  and  infrastructure,  but  has  failed  to  compete 
commercially  with  imported  rice  (Dermont  and  Rizzotto  2012).  This  is  partly  due  to  the 
government’s  focus  on  urban  populations  and  their  efforts  to  import  cheap  rice  from  Asia 
(Khouma et al. 2012, GFC website). 

Import vs. domestic production from a farmer perspective:  It is recognized today that the Senegal 
has  made  a  strategic  mistake  by  focusing  on  rice  to  ensure  the  country's  food  security. 
Promotional  efforts  must  be  made  towards  speculation  such  as  millet,  maize  and  fonio.  In 
Senegal, there are many experiments to introduce cereals other than rice into Senegalese diet. 
But the results are still mixed because of a lack of political will of the State of Senegal which does 
not support these efforts of food education. 
 
Import vs. domestic production from a researcher perspective: While the Government of Senegal 
has invested considerable resources on rice production, there are strong arguments to be made 
for focusing on other crops to more realistically attain food security in Senegal, such as millet. 
Millet  is  far  more  drought  resistant  that  other  major  staples  as  rice  and  sorghum,  a  critical 
characteristic to rural communities where soil fertility is poor and rains are unpredictable. Millet 
is  currently  grown  on  about  1  million  hectares  or  one-third  of  Senegal’s  arable  land.  In  the 
Senegalese regions of Kaolack, Kaffrine and Fatick, where most of the country’s millet and peanut 
are grown, typically on sandy soil.  Millet is interchanged with peanuts from one year to the next, 
a vital relationship as peanuts help to fix nitrogen in the soil. (GAIN 2011) 

Import vs. domestic production issues from a civil society perspective: The rice sector in Senegal 
does not seem to benefit from a good image. Rice cultivation is perceived to be ''too expensive'' 
because  it  requires,  in  large  part,  irrigation by pumping  and  mechanized  tillage.  Equipment  is 

 

63 

deteriorating  and  the  practice  of  renewing  or  repairing  needed  equipment  is  not  yet  well-
developed.  The  price  of  rice  produced  domestically  is  even  not  competitive  compared  to 
imported rice. 

The disruption of the marketing system and the liberalization of imports are among the many 
constraints  facing  local  rice.  The  main  causes  are:  uncontrolled  marketing  channels,  difficult 
access to inputs (including credit), lack of organisation of rice producers, poor production and 
uncontrolled imports of Asian rice. 

Proposed policy response:   Allocate greater resources in research, farmer training and education 
to the production of alternative, more drought resistant grains such as millet and fonio, based on 
an appreciation for traditional knowledge with these crops 

Take  measures to  promote  local  rice by structurally  improving the functioning  of the  internal 
market: reorganisation and organisation of the marketing circuit, inclusion of rice in the special 
registers (such as exists for onions), and support for a generalised reduction in production factors. 

4.19. Employment 

Current  status:  In  Senegal,  46  per  cent  of  people  work  in  agriculture.  Two  thirds  of  Senegal’s 
population is under the age of 18 and approximately 200,000 young people enter the job market 
each year fighting for around 30,000 formal jobs. Most informal jobs are in agriculture in rural 
areas, but the sector is lacking in productivity—it generates only around 16 percent of GDP—
hindering the creation of much needed jobs and prospects of improved livelihoods.  

Employment  from  a  farmer  perspective:  Agroecological  jobs  are  virtually  non-existent. 
Formalizing the sector, starting with a redistribution of land, would create jobs for young people 
and women. 

Employment from  a  researcher perspective:    A case  study  from  Senegal  features  a women’s 
union  that  suggests  one  pathway  to  increasing  employment  in  the  agroecology  sector.  The 
farmers  union,  representing  over  1,800  women  across  all  age  groups,  cultivates  around  300 
hectares of land. They welcome young people and helps them to learn new skills in the union. 
As a group, they invested in a small rice milling facility and the rice they produce gets delivered 
locally, but also to the capital city, Dakar. They named their product Riz Reine (Rice Queen) and 
built it up to be a trusted brand (Glatzel 2018). 
 
While  increasing  employment  is  extremely  important,  labour  can  nonetheless  be  quite  a 
constraint for rice farmers in Senegal. Agroecological practices, such as SRI, can increase labour 

 

64 

requirements which is not always accessible to farmers (Krupnik et al. 2010). This can especially 
be a concern for women, as they also have domestic work to do (USAID 2010).  
 
Through  policies  supporting  smaller,  community-based  rice  mills,  seed  banks,  and  the 
provisioning of biological inputs such as natural green manure, employment in the sector could 
be  increased.    All  of these  are relatively  labour-intensive  over  conventional  alternatives,  but 
interventions requiring investments that are labor-saving may not have such comparative value 
where labour is more readily available than monetary resources. Agroecology can provide more 
work  opportunities,  including  dignified,  meaningful  work  for  smallholder  rural  producers, 
particularly  since  it  encourages  experimentation,  ongoing  learning  and  sharing  with  peers 
(Bezner Kerr et al. 2018).  
 
Employment issues from a civil society perspective: Development of the irrigated rice value chain, 
with public and private investment in development and mechanization, paves the way for the 
emergence of professions and service providers in maintenance and care, management, logistics, 
operation of machinery, etc. However, land policy is a fundamental aspect to be taken first into 
account, since young people often face severe constraints in accessing the resources that permit 
them  to  participate  in  the  value  chain.  Population  growth  and  the  fragmentation  of  land 
ownership due to inheritance are holding back many young people in their desire to engage in 
lucrative  agricultural  activities  (IPAR 2014).  In  the  Senegal  River  delta,  the  relative  mobility of 
land  through  the  rental  or  sale  of  land  (even  if  these  are  illegal  transactions  under  the  law) 
facilitates young people's access to land, thus resulting in their greater involvement in agricultural 
production. However, these young people generally have not received the appropriate training 
and are not prepared to apply agroecological practices required in a productive and sustainable 
rice farming system. 

Proposed policy response: It is necessary to rethink agricultural policy, particularly its job creation 
component, by promoting initiatives that connect agroecological production systems and social 
organization,  enabling  farmers  to  find  their  rhythm  and  develop  as  true  agricultural 
entrepreneurs.  Job  creation  can  be  carried  out  through  knowledge-  and  labor-  intensive 
agroecological production and the formalization of the sector (see culture and food traditions). 
A coherent vocational training policy targeting young people, a promotion of mechanized and 
digital services, and integrated into an agri-environmental development policy for the value chain 
will make it possible to achieve a sustainable qualitative leap. A renewed rice cultivation, with 
well-trained  young  people  and  a  good  command  of  agroecological  practices,  should  make  it 
possible to achieve the sustainable objective of food sovereignty in rice. 

 

65 

4.20. Equity 

Equity issues from a farmer perspective: In Senegal, women and young people are the most 
active in the agroecology sector. The formalization of the agroecology sector would enable 
them to develop their income and their leadership within farmers' organizations and 
communities. 

Equity issues from a researcher perspective: “The Senegal River basin countries and the rest of 
West Africa have a relatively similar development history after independence. Their economies 
have not developed in pace with the other comparable developing regions. On the contrary, the 
GNP per capita halved between 1979 and 1995. In terms of human development, the region has 
developed far more slowly than other regions of the world have done. Food security remains a 
serious problem, and the food self-sufficiency has decreased in the region. It seems that the rural 
areas are challenged to produce the food for their own use, but are unable to feed the rapidly 
growing  cities,  which  in  turn  must  import  part  of  their  food.    With  this,  it  is  reasonable  to 
speculate that the problems in Senegal River development arise from broad development and 
regional, politics related issues. Also, it is clear that, in order to improve the situation along the 
river,  strong  actions  are  needed  to  boost  the  area’s  macro-economy.  In  the  light  of  this,  the 
strong  emphasis  on  hydropower  generation  and  large-scale  irrigation  is  understandable. 
However,  improving  human  development  in  fields  such  as  education  and  health  is  equally 
important in order to transfer the benefits of growth in the national economy to the inhabitants 
along the river. This should be the case in the rural villages especially, which now have lost their 
traditional livelihoods due to the river development schemes. A crucial mechanism in distributing 
the created wealth is due to developing the local markets and economic structures so that they 
are  linked  to  the  growing  urban  economic  activities.  The  future  may  see  major  trade-offs 
between  the  national  and  local  stakeholders.  Turning  these  into  equitable  solutions  requires 
integration  between  different  institutions  and  stakeholders,  as  well  as  all  the  environmental 
components along the river. Perhaps the biggest challenge is to get the two poles of development, 
national and local, to mirror their goals and actions in the same landscape, most importantly to 
get all stakeholders to express their views and affect the development options (Varis et al. 2008). 
 
In addition, although over 50% of rice area in Senegal are cultivated by women, gender gaps are 
found as well. Women are often seen as being the last one to access innovation and also gender 
gaps  have  been  found  between  access  to  agricultural  knowledge.  Also  adoption  rates  of 
improved  practices  are  different  between  men  are  women  (Zossou  et  al.,  2017;  Addison  and 
Ohene-Yankyera, 2018). In addition, according to cultural norms in Senegal, women do not sell 
rice, they save seeds from the previous year, they hardly invest in rice cultivation (no external 

 

66 

inputs like chemical fertilizer), and they do not grow rice as cash crop (Sullivan, 2002). It is thus 
key to include women in extension opportunities and training.  
 
Equity issues from a civil society perspective: There is no equity in support for inputs (seeds and 
fertilizers)  and  investments  (agricultural  equipment).  Indeed,  most  of  the  current  subsidies 
benefit large farmers. 

Proposed policy response: Empower people, especially women and young people at household, 
community  levels  and  beyond  by  building  knowledge,  through  collective  action  and  creating 
opportunities for commercialization (e.g. by promoting their participation in producer groups) 

The Ministry of Agriculture and its branches should objectively exploit the results of the analysis 
of the effects of subsidies and their contribution to the rice value chain and develop a recovery 
plan  that  secures  and  develops  the  potential  of  small  family  farms.  The  Social  and  Political 
Dialogue Group (GDSP) also provides a legal framework for discussing and validating proposals 
made in this regard to correct the imperfections mentioned above. 

4.21. Environmental impact 

Current  status:  Rice  represents  a  significant  share  of  these  impacts,  given  the  high  carbon-
intensity of rice production methods (e.g. paddies are major emitters of Envimethane), combined 
with high quantities of rice wastage. 

The cereal milling industry is acutely exposed to the impacts of climate change throughout the 
value  chain  where  a  lack  of  access  to  inputs,  extension,  equipment,  technical  guidance  and 
development  has  led  to  underperformance  and  created  vulnerabilities.  Climate  change  in 
Senegal is predicted to manifest as a decrease in the amount of rainfall—however with increased 
intensity, increased temperatures, and sea-level rise. Drought and saline intrusion threaten water 
supplies,  while  sea-level  rise  along  with  coastal  erosion  threaten  infrastructure  (UNDP  2016, 
UNIDO 2017 climate change impacts in Senegal. 
 
These changes, combined with population growth, could lead to a 30% reduction in per capita 
cereal production in 2025. However, this scenario is mitigated by the fact that in Senegal, maize 
and rice seem to be less negatively affected than other crops by the changing climate conditions, 
and their yields could potentially increase (Jalloh 2013). 

Environmental  impact  issues  from  a  farmer  perspective:  It  has  been  established  that 
agroecological  practices  have  the  potential  to  protect  the  environment  through  the  rational 

 

67 

management of water and soil. They allow the regeneration of soils, knowledge that needs to be 
popularized on a large scale. 

Environmental impact issues from a researcher perspective: The various agroecological rice farm 
practices  that  have  been  discussed  here  have  the  potential  to  have  a  lower  impact  on  the 
environment compared to conventional practices (e.g. AWD, SRI, IPM, etc.). These practices have 
shown  to  have  positive  effects  on  water  quality,  water  quantity,  GHG  emissions  and  habitat 
provision.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  limited  research  is  done  in  Senegal  to  study 
environmental impacts of agroecological practices in rice systems. In addition, research on the 
trade-offs  and  synergies  between  environmental  impact  and  other  aspects  such  as  food 
production, or cultural values is key. 

Environmental  impact  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  Some  irrigated  areas  have 
rudimentary drainage systems or none at all; this leads to excessive salinity levels on farms. In 
the  Senegal  River  Valley,  poor  water  quality  in  some  areas  affected  by  saline  intrusion  and 
drainage water discharged into the river and Lake Guiers contribute to the increase in the salinity 
of these waters.  

In  terms  of  environmental  pollution,  a  study  by  the  Organisation  for  the  Development  of  the 
Senegal River (OMVS) estimates that more than 150,000 tonnes of minerals are discharged into 
the Senegal River and its dependencies each year. In addition, the use by large farms of chemical 
pesticides to control granivorous birds should be considered. 

Proposed policy response: Include in future agriculture sector letters and SAED's next Mission 
Letter,  participatory  action  research  and  the  development  of  plants  for  the  treatment  of 
contaminated water (e. g. with Sesbania rostrata), strengthen control over pesticides and even 
move towards a ban on their import. 

4.22. Fair pricing 
 
Fair pricing issues from a researcher perspective: Ensuring fair prices paid to farmers for rice at 
mills/hulling operations is critical to building a strong, sustainable rice value chain.  The study of 
rice value chains in Rwanda highlighted the fact that investment in modern mills was undercut 
by farmers not willing to sell their rice to the mills, due to the lower prices they were offered 
compared  with  other  buyers.    As  a  result,  only  about  10%  of  the  paddy  being  produced  is 
processed in modern mills. The rest is going to seed, feed, losses, hand pounding, or husking by 
small hullers (Stryker 2010). 
 

 

68 

Fair pricing issues from a civil society perspective: The current or expected performance of the 
local  rice  market  is  influenced  by  interactions  with  the  imported  white  rice  market.  The 
characteristics  of  imported  rice  (quality,  price)  induce  changes  in  the  market  shares  of  the 
different rice categories and partly explain the relative competitiveness of local rice. Deficiencies 
are noted, mainly the lack of market and price control, the lack of promotion and communication 
measures on local rice (quality, price, availability, etc.), the lack of a technical basis for setting the 
price of paddy and white rice, (farm production account, cost of processing white rice). 
 
On the basis of the average production cost estimated at 80 FCFA/kg of paddy, the paddy price 
fixed by CIRIZ varies from 125 FCFA to 130 FCFA, the producer's margin estimated at 45 FCFA/kg 
of paddy is very sensitive to the price applied. If the price of paddy differs significantly from the 
official price, the producer's profitability is severely affected. This situation is made more fragile 
by  the  relatively  small  volumes  on  which  the  majority  of  these  producers  operate  (with  the 
exception of the few large producers). The margins of the other players are also not high enough. 
This undoubtedly explains the strong pressure that these downstream actors exert on producers 
to  reduce  the  official  price  of  paddy.  Only  productivity  gains  (increased  yields  and  lower 
production costs) could reasonably lead producers to accept lower prices. 

Proposed policy response: It is therefore important to look at the cost structure in the imported 
white  rice  value  chain,  to  learn  more  about  the  actors  involved  and  the  distribution  of  their 
margins, and to consider incentives and other protective measures that can contribute to better 
promotion of local rice. Reduce production costs, which today range from 76 to 82 CFA francs/kg 
of paddy depending on the type of perimeter thanks to the economies of scale achieved. 

4.2. Rice processing 
 
4.2.1. Processing infrastructure and investment 
Current  status:    The  cereal  milling  industry  in  Senegal  mainly  serves  the  domestic  market, 
providing important staples and critically contributing to the country’s food security.  Dakar has 
95% of Senegal’s industry including the major cereal mills. (UNIDO 2017).  
 
Two  diametrically  different  visions  have  been  proposed  for  processing  infrastructure  and 
investment in Senegal; to invest in larger-scale agribusiness schemes or to invest in supporting 
smaller-scale  family  farmers  to  participate  more  fully  in  rice  value  chains,  particularly  in  the 
processing stage. 

Characteristics  of  larger-scale  agribusiness  schemes:    These  have  been  described  by  Adesina, 
through  the  African  Development  Bank  Group.      Adesina  advocates  for  the  creation  of  staple 
crops processing zones across Africa (SCPZs): vast areas within rural areas set aside and managed 

 

69 

for agribusiness and food manufacturing industries and other agro-allied industries, enabled with 
right policies and infrastructure. He notes “I am convinced that just like industrial parks helped 
China,  so  will  the  SCPZs  help  to  create  new  economic  zones  in  rural  areas  that  will  help  lift 
hundreds of millions out of poverty through the transformation of agriculture- the main source 
of  their  livelihoods-  from  a  way  of  life  into  a  viable  profitable  business  that  will  unleash  new 
sources  of  wealth,”  he  said.   (African  Development  Bank  Group  2018).    This  approach  is  also 
reflected  in proposed programs  of the  Islamic  Development  Bank’s  Rice Regional  Value  Chain 
Program, which proposes to invest in the following key areas: 

1)  Infrastructure development: investments in socio-economic infrastructure (such as land 
development, irrigation canals, rural roads, market infrastructure, etc.). This is expected 
to increase productivity and projects and enhance smallholder access to markets  

2)  Research and Development/Science and technology: support to the national agriculture 
research  systems  in  ten  countries  of  West  Africa  and  the  Consultative  Group  on 
International Agricultural Research institutions (CGIAR) such as Africa Rice to develop and 
disseminate appropriate seed technologies and systems  

3)  Development  of  Value  Chains:  The  program  will  facilitate  and  build  public-private-
partnerships.  IsDB  together  with  other  development  partners  will  closely  work  with 
relevant institutions in the beneficiary countries develop in-put/output value chains that 
would generate rural employment and contribute to interregional trade and cooperation 
in Africa.  

4)  Capacity building to enhance enabling policy environment: for the program will support 
capacity building of beneficiary countries to create conducive and enabling environment. 
that would make economies competitive and attract private sector investment.  

 
The  program  will  support  (i)  improving  productivity  and  quality  of  paddy  and  milled  rice;  (ii) 
increasing efficiency of local rice processing and marketing; (iii) enhancing capacities to develop 
and promote adoption of integrated innovative practices and use of technologies. In addition, 
the  program  will  promote  sustainable  innovative  practices  and  principles  of  on  and  off  farm 
production and post-farm gate processes while addressing the needs of both men and women to 
enhance household income and create rural employment and entrepreneurship opportunities 
for young people and women farmers.  
 
Characteristics of agroecological approaches to the rice value chain in Senegal: In contrast to the 
larger-scale  agribusiness  schemes  described  above,  agroecological  approaches  stress  the 
following: 
 

•  Biological inputs 

 

70 

•  Small scale mechanization 
•  Businesses to rent and maintain machinery 
•  Farmer to farmer training 
•  Small scale irrigation and community water management systems,  
•  Aquaculture industries (supply of fish fingerlings, fish processing plants)  
•  Community threshing, dehusking and sorting. (Diagne et al. 2017) 
•  Recycling of residues on farm and from mill 
•  Storage facilities on farm or in villages 
•  Farmer unions formed creating better bargaining prices for farmers 
•  Community-owned and small to medium sized mills,  
•  Transportation  systems  rationalized  to  reduce  costs  and  ensure  even  distribution  of 

milled rice between rural and urban areas,  

•  Agroecologically  produced  rice  and  traditional  rice  marketed  to  consumers  with  a 

preferential price. 

 
Processing  infrastructure  and  investment  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective:  In  recent 
developments in a number of African countries, the liberalisation of rice marketing and milling 
has led to the introduction of small rice hulling operations (Stryker 2010). These have proven to 
be less expensive and more economically efficient than larger, often state-owned mills. As Stryker 
(2010) notes, “West Africa is filled with examples of how the introduction of small rice hullers 
contributed  to  higher  prices  for  producers,  lower  prices  for  consumers,  and  greater  market 
efficiency. For example, in the Office du Niger in Mali, small-scale hullers competed very well 
with large, inefficient and costly rice mills owned by the state. This led to liberalization of rice 
marketing and expansion of rice production and processing. In Rwanda and other countries, small 
to medium-sized modern mills (0.2-3.5 t/hour) were found to be profitable and provide multiple 
community benefits; and can continue to be profitable paying a proper market price for rice to 
farmers.” 
 
An additional benefit of smaller decentralized mills is that by-products can be utilized, instead of 
turned to waste. As noted by Stryker (2010): “The by-product of processing most rice in small 
hullers is usually a mixture of husks, bran, and some broken grains.  This is a relatively good animal 
feed, especially for ruminants, and can contribute to food security through the livestock sector. 
Other uses are as organic fertilizers or use in breweries or other sectors”. 

Processing infrastructure and investment issues from a civil society perspective: In the Senegal 
River  Valley,  there  are  458  private  rice  threshers  that  process  nearly  77%  of  paddy  rice,  28 
functional rice mills or mini-rice mills offer rice that is popular with consumers (SAED, 2018). 

 

71 

Proposed policy response: Support for smaller and medium sized decentralized mills and storage 
facilities  managed  by  the  communities  (providing  benefits,  such  as  capacity  for  milling  by-
products to be allocated to other uses, such as animal feed, field fertilizers, breweries or other 
sectors,  reduction  of  transportation  costs,  higher  prices  for  producers,  lower  prices  for 
consumers, greater market efficiency and availability at the community markets) 

An agricultural and industrial policy that is concerned with job creation should propose specific 
strategies to support these small businesses in order to develop them towards quality standards 
and  support  those  that  are  capable  of  growing.  Unfortunately,  policy  options  are  often  more 
favourable to large-scale foreign private investment and do not necessarily create jobs. 

4.2.2. Ownership of processing facilities 
 
Ownership  of  processing  facilities 
issues  from  a  farmer  perspective:  Support  peasant 
organizations and  local traders  to  create  mills  at  the  community  level  to  avoid transportation 
costs and provide lower prices on produced rice and allow availability at the community markets.  
 
Ownership of processing facilities issues from a researcher perspective: Promoting cooperative 
and community ownership over mills. (Although, from other researcher perspectives, such 
vertical integration should consider the current role of millers, and how this would impact them 
(AfricaRice, pers.comm.). 

Ownership of processing facilities issues from a civil society perspective: Processing facilities are 
privately  owned.  About  70%  of  the  local  rice  is  supplied  by  artisanal  huskers  and  only  30%  is 
produced by so-called modern rice mills (MRAs). Hence the difficulty in guaranteeing quality rice 
in time and space. This has a negative impact on consumer appropriation of rice. 

Proposed policy response: as above, Support for smaller and medium sized decentralized mills 
and storage facilities managed by the communities. The State, with the support of development 
NGOs and donors, must implement a material support training programme for manufacturers of 
artisanal huskers and service providers to improve the quality of rice processing. 

4.2.3. Use of rice by-products  

Use of rice by-products issues from a farmer perspective: Support for promoting by-products.  
These smaller mills also provide the capacity for rice milling by-products to be allocated to 
other uses, such as animal feed, field fertilizers, breweries or other sectors.  

 

72 

Use of rice by-products issues from a researcher perspective: The major by-products of rice are 
rice  husk  and  straw,  which  have  various  potential  uses.  Risk  husks  could  be  pressed  into 
briquettes, which can be used as green charcoal (Bogdanski et al., 2016). This could provide an 
alternative fuel source to fuel wood, as many Senegal households lack access to energy sources 
(Alesbury, 2013). Rice straw is either left in the field for grazing of cattle or buried into soil to 
improve  soil  fertility  (UNFCCC,  n.d.);  however,  researchers  note  that  while  burying  straw  is 
recommended, it is not yet a common practice.  Too often, farmers burn rice residues (M. Diagne, 
pers. comm.). 
 
Use of rice by-products issues from a civil society perspective: Much of the rice straw is burned 
on  site before  cultivation  -  due to  the difficulties  of  removing  it from the  fields.  According to 
ARORA  (1976),  the  straw/paddy  ratio  is  1.44  and  falls  to  0.6  with  the  mechanization  of  rice 
harvesting. Thus, the tonnages of rice straw also varies considerably depending on the regions 
and harvesting techniques used. The feed value of rice straw varies from year to year, depending 
on  the  varieties  grown,  cultural  practices,  dates  and  harvesting  methods.  As  both  a  ballast 
element and an energy source, it is a good carrier for molasses, capable of covering 30 to 70% of 
the animals' energy needs. 
 
The by-products of rice processing in rice mills are rice husks, husker sounds, cone flours and 
basic flours. Cone meal is probably the most interesting by-product for animals. They are rich in 
protein, fat, and carbohydrates. They are highly digestible and have an energy value close to 1 
UF/kg MS (Djoudeitingar, 1993). However, it should be noted that part of the rice produced in 
Senegal is exported to Mauritania to feed dairy cows (Tiviski network). There is a lack of policy 
on the price of by-products. The latter are dependent on the law of supply and demand (FAO, 
2014). Mauritanians sometimes buy basic flours before the rice is even planted. Basic rice flour 
is used to feed poultry or ruminants. It is now estimated that a quarter of the  basic rice meal 
produced in the valley is used to feed poultry. Rice mills use different channels to market rice 
products.  The  most  modern  (i.e.  those  producing  basic  flour  of  very  good  quality)  establish 
contracts with industrialists and sell part of the production to small wholesalers and breeders 
(Lambaré, 2015). These volumes are highly variable throughout the year. Livestock farmers buy 
mainly when pasture resources decline, and they supplement animals to save them. 
 
Proposed policy response:  as above: Support for smaller and medium sized decentralized mills 
and storage facilities managed by the communities (providing benefits, such as capacity for 
milling by-products to be allocated to other uses, such as animal feed, field fertilizers, breweries 
or other sectors,   

 

73 

Support and encourage the integration of agriculture and livestock into the PNAR (Programme 
national d'autosuffisance en riz) to improve the value of rice by-products and complete the cycle 
from  production  to  consumption.  This  should  be  reflected  in  the  field  by  a  broad  awareness 
campaign accompanied by a broad communication campaign and a strong partnership between 
processors,  breeders  and  farmers.  There  is  a  need  for  a  pricing  policy  for  agro-industrial  by-
products 

4.3. Rice distribution 

 

4.3.1. Transportation 
 
Transportation  issues  from  a  researcher  perspective:  Reduced  transportation  costs  can  result 
from  smaller  and  medium  sized  decentralized  mills.    When  rice  marketing  and  milling  was 
liberalized in many African countries, this led to the introduction of small rice hullers, who could 
process  rice  more  inexpensively  than  large  state-owned  mills,  and  also  showed  a  substantial 
savings in the cost of transporting rice to mills (Stryker 2010).  
 
Transportation issues from a civil society perspective: Transport remains essential because of the 
distance between production and consumption areas. The means of transport must be adapted 
to the needs, in sufficient number. 

Proposed policy response: The Senegalese government's challenge to rapidly increase local rice 
production  must  be  accompanied  by  all  the  support  logistics  it  requires  in  terms  of  storage, 
transport and infrastructure. It is necessary to strengthen the appropriate infrastructure linking 
rice fields, processing units and distribution sites to ensure that the market is supplied correctly 
but also to optimise logistics costs and reduce transaction costs, through collection points for 
example. Measures should be developed to Improve operators' access to logistics (packaging, 
transport, storage), financial information and services. 

4.3.2. Continuity of supply  

Current status: Many challenges exist in the current rice food value chain around the lack of 
storage facilities, and its impacts on the continuity of supply. 

Continuity  of  supply  issues  from  a  farmer  perspective:  Even  though  the  rice  mills  are 
decentralized, it will be necessary to have storage facilities that are managed by the communities 
themselves. Only in this way will the sector be formalized, well managed and more importantly 
to avoid food insecurity. 

 

74 

 
Continuity of supply issues from a researcher perspective: Investment in storage facilities which 
may be less need if rice mills are decentralized. Lack of ready availability of local rice 
throughout the year may also be a problem. 

Proposed policy response:  The ARM should adjust the quota on rice imports according to the 
production quantities expected in the period, to even out the continuity of supply and support 
local production more effectively. 

4.3.3. Rice markets-general  
 
Rice markets-general- from a farmer perspective: Policies are needed that ensure that: 

1)  There are prices and rice qualities for all income levels and  
2)  The different qualities of rice that consumers are used to, are produced and present on 

local markets on a permanent basis. 

In Senegal, it is very common to buy a brand of rice that you cannot find the next week on your 
local market. This brings the need of support from the banks and the government to local rice 
producers and traders, to provide credit that can stabilize rice markets.  
 
Rice  markets-general-  from  a  researcher  perspective:  Markets  have  a  major  role  in  shaping 
consumer  preferences  (Hawkes  2002).    In  many  locations,  they  are  the  key  place  where 
consumers are exposed to information and products that shape food preferences and ultimately 
choices (Clary et al. 2017). “Markets and other economic institutions do more than just allocate 
goods and services; they also influence the evolution of values, tastes and personalities” (Bowles 
1998). Studies analyzing the challenges facing local rice in urban markets indicate that local rice 
has a poor market share as it Is perceived as being of inferior quality; however it also has a lower 
price, certainly of interest to poorer consumers (Faimohe et al. 2018).  Policies are needed that 
explicitly seek to maintain a diversity of rice on the market, of both high quality and broken rice 
markets, for different consumers, and rice reflecting local consumers’ preference.  Various policy 
measures  proposed  include  encouraging  investment  in  quality  upgrading,  imposing  tariffs  to 
increase the cost-competitiveness of West African rice relative to imported rice, while still leaving 
open the market windows for low-cost, broken rice markets.    

Rice markets-general- issues from a civil society perspective: Facilitate contractual agreements 
between traders, processors and agricultural producers. 

Proposed  policy  response:  Increase  the  potential  of  territories  to  sustain  their  peoples  by 
reconnecting food habits and culture as well as food production and food  consumption (e.g. 

 

75 

ensure  that  rice  production  matches  the  food  preferences  of  consumer  and  promote  the 
cultural value of rice in Senegal). 

 

4.3.4. Organization of marketing  

Organization of marketing from a researcher perspective:  Better organization of marketing is 
needed, and the creation of cooperative groups in charge of buying, processing, and selling 
milled rice. 

Organization of marketing issues from a civil society perspective: Improving product distribution 
is a very important factor in increasing competitiveness. 

Proposed  policy  response:  Support  farmers  institutions  and  community-based  cooperatives 
improving  access  to  training,  markets,  inputs,  capital,  information,  research,  storage  and 
processing options on a community level as well as the organization of marketing (e.g. document, 
capitalize and share traditional knowledge among producers, support agroecological community 
management and more exchanges between agro-ecological producers in Senegal and those in 
countries like Burkina Faso and Benin.  

A trade promotion policy must be developed that covers the entire country and all local cereals 
(rice,  millet/sorghum,  maize  and  fonio),  promoting  the  diversity  of  local  cereal-based  food 
products associated with rice. The image of local rice can be further enhanced, accompanied by 
the trademarks of local processors. A multi-pronged competitive strategy against imported rice 
and its by-products is needed. The aim is to communicate intensively on the entire range of food 
products that can be produced from local cereals (including rice), highlighting food aspects in 
terms of quality, hygiene and nutritional benefits. 
 

4.3.5. Credit in the value chain 

Current status: Traders in cities may be reluctant to carry local rice due to a lack of credit from 
wholesalers, whereas trading terms between retailers and wholesalers for imported rice consist 
of well worked out agreements 

Credit in the value chain issues from a civil society perspective: The market regulation system put 
in place has enabled the financial sector to become more involved with credit in the value chain, 
alongside  the  Caisse  Nationale  de  Crédit  Agricole  du  Sénégal  (CNCAS),  the  operations  of  the 
Banque Nationale pour le Développement Economique (BNDE), the Bourse Régionale des Valeurs 
Mobilières (BRVM) and other institutions that have created positions as value chain managers. 
Between  2015  and  2016,  the  quantities  marketed  by  BNDE  and  BRM  under  the  platform 

 

76 

increased  from  10,633  to  15,069  tonnes,  more  than  65%  of  which  was  whole  rice  for  a  total 
financing of CFAF 5.9 billion (source: ARM). 

Credit in the value chain, issues from a researcher perspective: In understanding the dynmaics 
around the rice value chain in Senegal, and the ways that credit influences this, there is a need 
to include the crop insurance program as a strategy for risk management.  This was initiated in 
the country since 2008, and started in 2012 in the Senegal River Valley (Sandmark et al. 2013).  
The rice insurance product is an indemnity-based named-peril insurance for rice against 
granivorous birds, nocturnal birds, and rainfall. Initial engagement with farmers in Senegal was 
problematic (Muller 2012). Senegal was the only country where Government provides subsidies 
for insurance, but farmers were reluctant to participate, questioning the levels of protection 
and cost.  Greater affordability may come at the cost of insuring only against extreme climate 
hazards (Muller 2012). 

Proposed policy response: Communicate more with banks on the functioning of the value chain. 
Better  knowledge  of  it  by  financial  institutions  would  also  allow  processors  and  producers  to 
access more and cheaper financing. 

Support financial organizations to extend credit and micro-credit to provide preferential terms 
to  producers  or  traders  of  agroecological  products  only,  and  other  producers  or  traders 
otherwise contributing to resilience. 

4.4. Rice consumption 

 

4.4.1. Consumption patterns and policies 

Current status: Senegal, along with Madagascar, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau are the only 
countries (with populations greater than 1 million) outside of Asia where rice contributes more 
than 30% of caloric intake.  Of these five African countries, in Madagascar and Sierra Leone rice 
composes greater than 30% of the total crop harvested domestically, but in Senegal, along with 
Guinea  and  Guinea-Bissau  there  is  a  strong  discrepancy  between  domestic  demand  and 
consumption of rice, and domestic production, with important implications for food security. ` 

In Senegal, the share of calories consumed per person from rice increased from 20% in 1961 to 
31% in 2007. Rice is growing in popularity with consumers, as it requires less preparation time 
and less energy to cook than most other staples, including beans, cassava, banana and potato.  
These  savings  are  key  as  women  participate  more  in  the  labor  market,  and  more  food  is 

 

77 

consumed away from home.  Other desirable attributes of rice are its relative ease of storage and 
handling, and its long shelf life. 

Consumption patterns issues from a researcher perspective:  A recent study looked at the degree 
to which national policies promote nutrition, and not just food security in Senegal (Lachat et al. 
2015).  Through  interviews  with  those  responsible  for  formulating  food  and  nutrition  policy, 
respondents mainly perceived their contributions to the improvement of nutrition to be related 
to  the  increase  of  food  supply  and  diversity.  Policy  makers  focused  less  on  social  or  cultural 
aspects  of  food  habits,  such  as  practices,  perceptions,  and  community  participation  or 
empowerment. Items that related to postharvest handling, storage, and marketing of agricultural 
produce were less frequently included in the policy documents. In particular, activities to expand 
market access of nutrient-rich foods were absent from the food security policies reviewed. The 
respondents noted that the current agricultural programs in which they were involved had no 
explicit nutritional goals and as such did not include nutritional indicators. Yet, the reduction of 
postharvest losses, organization of nutrition education and promotion, improvement of storage, 
and  expansion  of  markets  and  market  access  are  areas  that  offer  considerable  scope  for 
improvement and explicit focus in policies. 
 
The  PAA  program  in  the  Kédougou  region  of  Senegal,  over  the  period  2013  to  2016,  offers 
examples  and  lessons  for  programmes  to  address  nutrition  and  sustainable  agriculture  at  the 
same  time.  As  the  project  and  its  outcomes  were  manifold,  we  cite  the  findings  of  a  recent 
assessment (Diagne et al. 2017): 
 

“The Kédougou region registered the highest poverty rate in Senegal – 71.3 percent in 2011 
compared to 46.7 percent of the national average (ANSD, 2011) –and a prevalence rate of 
food  insecurity  of  33  percent  (SE-CNSA,  2013)    In  a  pilot  project  financed  by  Brazil  and 
implemented  by  WFP  and  FAO,  children  in  200  schools  in  the  Kédougou  region  were 
provided school lunches with locally produced rice, through the PAA program.  Around 1,000 
small producers sold half their total production - 250 tonnes of paddy rice to school feeding 
programmes  last  year,  increasing  their  income.  The  project  built  bridges  between 
agriculture and education by using school canteens as markets for rice produced by small 
producers in areas where the beneficiary schools are located.  The Senegalese government 
supported the initiative and hopes to eventually make school feeding a central pillar in a 
national policy that promotes local cereals as a way generate additional income for  local 
producers,  while  improving  child  nutrition.    Additional  benefits  accrued  as  well:  school 
canteens created through the project  proved to be a powerful tool to attract and retain 
schoolchildren rather than leaving school. The project succeeded to strengthen the capacity 
of producers through a series of training sessions and regular surveillance by means of field 

 

78 

visits.  Producers  were  trained  in  the  technical  aspects  of  rice  crop  management, 
organizational dynamics and security reserve policies They also received agricultural pre-
harvest  and  post-harvest  equipment  (seed  kits,  fertilizer  and  rice  dehusking  equipment. 
Several  farmer  unions  were  formed  during  the  course  of  the  project  in  the  area.  The 
average yield was estimated at 2.5 mt/ha in 2012/2013 and 3.2 mt/ha in 2015/2016 against 
0.8 mt/ha in 2011/2012, a respective increase of 1.7 mt/ha. On average, the quantity of 
paddy rice produced by the beneficiary producers has almost doubled from 422 kg to 808 
kg,  with  stronger  growth  among  women  producers.  The  increase  in  production  has  not 
lowered  the  price  for  producers  of  paddy  rice.  One  of  the  major  goals  of  the  project  in 
supporting producer  organizations  was  developing  their  negotiating  capacity;  paddy  rice 
prices paid to beneficiary producers were higher than those recorded in other regions of 
the country, as in the Senegal River Valley. The income of beneficiary producers has grown 
rapidly as a result of increased production and better prices for the producer. This allowed 
producers to increase their food expenses, but also their health and education expenses. 
The food security of beneficiary producer households has improved greatly; producers have 
sold their grain surpluses after setting up security reserves.  The project has brought other 
benefits to producers: the time spent on working on land preparation for cropping has in 
fact  decreased; women,  in particular,  benefited from  this  and were  able  to  increase the 
amount  of  time  devoted  to  other  agricultural  activities,  and  thus  improving  their  yields 
more than the men could. In addition, they could use the time they save for their well-being 
and that of their households.  

With respect to school canteens, it is questionable whether they will continue to function 
normally  after  the  withdrawal  of  PAA.  The  number  of  schools  benefiting  from  canteens 
dropped from 180 to 90 in two academic years, and by the end of November 2016 no school 
was running its canteen. The continuity of operating school canteens is a battle that is far 
from being won. Moreover, schools benefiting from PAA Senegal have not learned how to 
source directly from local producers to the extent that dealings between the two categories 
of beneficiaries has not been tested by the project. However, buying local products to feed 
the students is PAA Africa’s pioneering idea. WFP was directly responsible for purchasing 
rice  from  producers; the  schools  received rice  directly  from  WFP  and were  not  in direct 
relation with the producers. How can the concept then become functional if the project 
ends before the concept is tested?” 

 

Consumption  patterns  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  Rice  is  a  strategic  cereal  for 
Senegal, given its prominent place in the eating habits of Senegalese people and its weight on 
the country's trade balance. With an estimated demand of 3000 tonnes of rice per day, or an 
estimated consumption of 78 kg/year per capita, Senegal is one of the largest rice consumers in 

 

79 

West Africa. However, the tragedy is that the State, through its National Rice Self-Sufficiency 
Programme (PNAR), has put more emphasis on the quantity to be produced without worrying 
about the disastrous consequences of the conventional production system promoted against 
the environment and human health. The local rice consumed is treated with dangerous chemical 
herbicides. Beyond the availability of food, it must be safe for human, animal and environmental 
health. 

Proposed  policy  response:  Increase  public  awareness  of  the  potential  for  sustainable  rice 
farming  systems,  including  agroecological  practices,  to  protect  the  environment  through  the 
rational management of water and regeneration of soils 
 
Encourage the procurement by public services of agroecological rice (Hospitals, schools, armed 
forces, prisons, etc.) 
 
Reconnect producers  and  consumers  by strengthening  short food  circuits  and  local  markets, 
including small scale production and processing (see culture and food traditions) 
 
Focus on social or cultural aspects of food habits, such as practices, perceptions, and community 
participation or empowerment. 
 
Increase  the  level  of  consumer  awareness  of  their  right  to  access  agroecological  rice  that 
guarantees  their  health  and  that  of  biodiversity.  Substantial  investments,  preferably  those 
running on renewable energies, are needed to increase machining capacities with a relatively low 
carbon footprint, through small and large industrial units, in order to meet mass production. 
 

4.4.2. Local demand vs. imported  

Current status: Locally produced, often rainfed rice tends to be considered of lower quality, with 
impurities  mixed  within  and  not  of  uniform  grain  size  and  color  (Campbell  et  al.  2009).  
Consumers perceive that local rice requires time for cleaning and sorting, and  requires longer 
cooking time due to lack of uniformity.  Imported rice is widely available in cities around the year, 
while local rice is consumed when harvested, more in rural areas close to production areas. 

Local demand vs. imported issues, from a farmer perspective: Local rice production must match 
the  food  preferences  of  the  Senegalese  consumer.  To  replace  imported  rice,  agroecologically 
produced  local  rice  must  contain  less  impurities,  broken  and  easy  to  prepare.  Hence  the 
importance  of  selecting  seeds,  testing  them  and  producing  them  in  order  to  achieve  their 
permanent availability on the market.  
 

 

80 

Local demand vs. imported issues, from a researcher perspective:  An analysis of rice value chains 
in West African countries found the primary disadvantage of local rice over imports Is due to the 
poor quality of milling, and a lack of policy support for investment in mills that are capable of 
producing a rice that is competitive in the market (Stryker 2010).  Lack of product uniformity is 
perceived  by  consumers  in  West  Africa  to  lead  to  longer  cooking  times  and  unpredictable 
preparation requirements, as the cleaning and sorting of this rice prior to cooking is thought to 
take longer and be more laborious.  Credit arrangements also impact the choice of local versus 
imported rice: Traders in urban areas are reluctant to carry local rice because of lack of credit 
from wholesalers, whereas credit is generally available from importers and the wholesalers to 
whom they sell.  Senegalese consumers, however, more than consumers in other West African 
countries show preferences for local, valued Senegal River Valley rice over imported rice due to 
its taste characteristics, even if impure and poorly sorted.  Well-branded rice, designating place 
of origin,  local fragrant rice,  also  received  price premiums.  (Diagne  et al.  2017; Demont  et  al. 
2012, Rutseart et al 2018)  The investment of the government of Rwanda in good quality, but 
medium sized mills of 1-3 t/hr is proposed as a viable solution in West Africa, where rice may be 
milled more locally but also of better quality, to compete with imported rice.  Fair prices paid to 
farmers needs to be an important part making such value chains work.  In more isolated areas, 
small mills are seen as appropriate, giving ownership to the co-operatives and individual owners 
the  sense that  they  are able  to  make  productive  investments that  capture  some  of  the  value 
added in the commodity chain. 

Local  demand  vs.  imported  issues  from  a  civil  society  perspective:  Senegalese  rice  imports 
amounted  in  2015  to  1,159,333  tonnes,  representing  a  value  of  more  than  FCFA  226  billion 
(COMEX  2015).  Taking  into  account  the  efforts  made  in  recent  years  and  the  progress  made, 
national production reached, in 2015, 906,348 tonnes of paddy, more than three-quarters of the 
level of imports (source: PNAR). The market regulation system put in place has made it possible 
to  guarantee  a  strong  involvement  of  importer-distributors  in  the  marketing  of  local  rice,  to 
ensure  a  "quality"  rice  to  consumers  with  certification  by  a  third-party  holder.  To  this  end,  a 
marketing platform is being set up to promote the proper marketing of Senegalese rice. This is 
made up of the services of the Ministry of Commerce (DCI, ARM, etc.), the services of the Ministry 
of Agriculture (PNAR, SAED and SODAGRI), UNACOIS, the Association des Riziers du Nord (ARN) 
representing the rice mills approved by SAED, 11 rice importers (import at least 2% of rice), banks 
(BNDE, BRM and CNCAS) and third-party holding and quality certification companies etc. (ARM 
2015). However, this platform has some shortcomings such as: not all modern rice mills put their 
production in the platform, the quantities put on the market under the scheme are very small (-
30,000T) compared to the production potential of the mills), quality certification is expensive for 
the rice mills, the absence of a marketing contract upstream of the chain, and the rice processing 
plants do not always know the buyers.

Proposed  policy  response:  Promotional  efforts  towards  greater  diversity  in  cultivation  and 
consumption  of  crops  (for  example  promoting  other  grains  such  as  millet,  maize  and  fonio 
instead of focusing on rice only, but also the diversity within rice: high quality and broken rice 
to match the food preferences of the Senegalese consumer). 
 
Support  for  decentralized  small  and  medium  sized  mills,  and  community  ownership  where 
possible.  Fair prices must be paid to producers. 
 
Strengthen the Market Regulation Agency (MRA) in its mission to overcome extroversion and be 
less dependent on the outside world. This could be achieved by consolidating the rice marketing 
platform,  and  translating  the  corrective  measures  validated  within  it  into  regulatory  texts 
validated by the legal authorities in order to promote the correct disposal of local rice. Open the 
platform to other merchants who wish to integrate. 

 
4.4.3. Cultural importance  

Current status: Rice is critically important in the cultural life of Senegal; the country’s national 
dish is rice with fish (thièbou-djène).  

Cultural  importance  issues  from  a  farmer  perspective:  Locally  agroecologically  produced  rice 
plays a very important role in the cultural celebrations of local communities in Senegal. Examples 
during birth, death, funerals, weddings and initiation ceremonies during which the young person 
moves into adulthood. Even in areas like Casamance where rice and fish (thiébou-dieune) is not 
the national dish, all dishes are rice-based. This situation must remain as such for the rice culture 
to continue to be practiced ensuring the food security of the communities. 

Cultural importance issues from a researcher perspective:  As described earlier under traditional 
knowledge, indigenous varieties of Africa rice holds unique cultural values; such as being sacred 
to the Jola people in the Casamance region of Senegal (Linares 2009). Both the genetic traits of 
Africa rice and the traditional practices of rice cultivation hold greater interest for researchers 
and farmers, working together to improve farming systems based on local knowledge.  Farmers 
in Senegal seem highly affected by influences from other farmers in the neighborhood, such as 
traditional  common  practices  of  an  area  or  specific  actions  of  neighbours.  When  adapting 
agroecological practices this is thus key to take into account: that cultural norms and practices 
are valued and readily shared in and between many Senegalese communities.  

Proposed  policy  response:  Promotional  efforts  towards  greater  diversity  in  cultivation  and 
consumption  of  crops  (for  example  promoting  other  grains  such  as  millet,  maize  and  fonio 

 

82 

instead of focusing on rice only, but also the diversity within rice: high quality and broken rice to 
match the food preferences of the Senegalese consumer). 
 
Increase  the  potential  of  territories  to  sustain  their  peoples  by  reconnecting  food  habits  and 
culture  as  well  as  food  production  and  food  consumption  (e.g.  ensure  that  rice  production 
matches the food preferences of consumer and promote the cultural value of rice in Senegal) 
 

4.4.4. Food security/food sovereignty 
 
Current status: About one in five people do not consume adequate diets in Senegal (WFP 2014). 
Only five percent of food consumed is from the household’s own production; a large majority of 
food consumed in both rural and urban settings is purchased from the market. Cereals contribute 
about  two  thirds  of  the  caloric  energy  supply  (FAO  2010).  Rice  is  the  largest  share  of  cereal 
consumption, though millet, sorghum, wheat, and corn are also consumed. Over time the share 
of calories from rice increased from 20% in 1961 to 31% in 2007 (GRISP). 
 
Fish, livestock, and milk are the main sources of animal protein. 

Food security/sovereignty issues from a researcher perspective:  Locally produced, lower quality 
rice has an important role to play in contributing to food security.  With its comparatively lower 
price, it remains a formidable resource for food insecure families.  In addition, the by-product of 
rice milled is usually a mixture of husks, bran and some broken grains, serving as an animal feed 
for  ruminants,  and  can contribute to food  security  via  the  livestock  sector.  The  small  scale of 
informal hullers and small rice miles allows them to be owned and operated by a number of small 
entrepreneurs, creating income and employment, and — though this — improved food security. 
Finally, availability of a large number of small rice-processing units creates an environment in 
which competition flourishes, ensuring that costs to consumers are minimized (Stryker 2010). 

As noted above, food security policies often neglect important measures for nutritional security. 
In particular, in the polices of Senegal, a greater attention to the reduction of postharvest losses, 
storage, nutrition education and promotion, and expansion of markets and market access are 
areas that offer considerable scope improving nutrition security (Lachat et al. 2015). 

Food security/sovereignty issues from a civil society perspective: According to the principles of 
food security/sovereignty, the availability of food resources as well as their accessibility must be 
preserved in a stable manner over time. Food must be available over time (from one period to 
another) and in space (from one region to another). It is therefore necessary to take into account 
future  conditions.  Food security must  therefore be  sustainable.  This  means  ensuring that  rice 

 

83 

production systems can continue to produce in the future as they do today or evolve in ways that 
will not be dead ends. But considering that availability, accessibility and stability are the three 
indispensable pillars of food security, considering also the fact that conventional rice cultivation 
is  reaching  a  dead  end,  food  security/food  sovereignty  will  only  be  achieved  through  the 
agroecological rice cultivation system. And in addition to these three dimensions of food security, 
the local rice produced must be safe for health and in line with the population's eating habits. 

Proposed policy response: Respect the need for a diversity of rice types (broken as well as pure, 
traditional varieties) for different consumers.  Increase a focus on promoting alternative grains 
such as millet and fonio. 

in  the  polices  of  Senegal,  a  greater  attention  to  the  reduction  of  postharvest  losses,  storage, 
nutrition education and promotion, and expansion of markets and market access are areas that 
offer  considerable  scope  improving nutrition  security.    It  is  noted  that  in  other  countries, the 
lower  rice  grades  are  used  for  the  production  of  rice-based  products  (rice-based  products 
(noodle, fortified rice, etc),  In Senegal, as consumers have a preference for broken rice, it might 
be that whole grains could be used more in this way (Diagne, pers. comm.). 

In the context of political and social dialogue, civil society must call on the State to reform, with 
the support of stakeholders in the value chain, the national rice self-sufficiency programme, the 
conclusions of which should give great importance to agroecology, which is now President Macky 
Sall's fourth priority, according to his statement for his second term of office. 

4.4.5. Governance across the food value chain 
 
Current status: Senegal is a lower middle-income country with an agriculture sector accounting 
for 17.5 percent of the GDP. Although the contribution of agriculture to the economy is lower 
than the average in sub-Saharan Africa (24 percent), the sector remained the primary means of 
livelihood for 69 percent of the workforce in 2013. The government aims to make agriculture an 
engine of economic growth, as stated in the Agro-Sylvo-Pastoral Orientation Law (LOASP) voted 
in 2004, which constitutes the legal framework for the development of agriculture in Senegal for 
the next 20 years. The adoption of this law resulted in the formulation of several operational 
programmes such as the National Agricultural Development Programme, the National Livestock 
Plan and the Grand Agricultural Offensive for Food and Abundance (GOANA) (FAO 2015).  
 
Senegalese  producers  and  the  agriculture  sector  in  general  are  confronted  with  a  number  of 
challenges that must be addressed by public authorities. Since the 2007-2008 food price crisis, 
the government has been implementing important measures to support production and the main 
focuses  have  been  the  improvement  of  risk  management  and  the  increase  of  domestic  rice 

 

84 

production. Other important matters have received less attention such as fisheries management 
and  the  poor  structuring  of  value-chains.  As  for  the  land  policy,  identified  by  the  LOASP  as  a 
priority for agricultural development and modernization, the document should be completed by 
the end of 2015 (FAO 2015) 

Governance issues in the value chain from a farmer perspective: Any agroecological policy 
must: 

1)  Subsidize agro-ecological inputs such as fertilizers and their large-scale local production 

to reduce their cost; 

2)  Through the decentralization policy in Senegal, adopt laws that regulate the access to 

land of agro-ecological producers; 

3)  Make sure within the framework of the ECOWAS common agricultural policy that the 

neighboring states of Senegal also adopt an AE policy.; 

4)  Protect the domestic rice with a higher Common External Tariff (CET) and 
5)  Encourage the consumption by public services of agroecological rice (Hospitals, schools, 

armed forces, prisons, etc.) 

Governance issues in the value chain from a researcher perspective:  Governance over food value 
chains rarely account for externalities, both positive and negative.  In Rwanda, in addition to taxes 
on imports, the government provides substantial subsidies on production by paying for irrigation 
infrastructure and subsidizing the transportation of fertilizer. These subsidies amount to close to 
30% of total on-farm production costs. Rice production is financially profitable everywhere, partly 
because of the subsidies involved. It is economically profitable in most, though not all, locations 
in competition with rice imports. But these policies do not account for externalities, nor support 
agroecological approaches.  While there are substantive negative externalities to conventional 
rice  production  and  food  value  chains,  there  are  also  significant  positive  externalities  within 
agroecological approaches as described here, including: 

•  Greater  use  and  enhancement  of  the  ecosystem  services  of  natural  pest  control  and 

natural fertility maintenance 

•  Maintenance of rice ecosystems that enhance biodiversity (fish, frogs, birds, insects) 
•  Smaller-scale  irrigation  and  community  water  management  systems  that  make  more 

efficient and fair use of water than large-scale schemes 

•  Fostering of small-scale enterprises around mechanization, seeds, fisheries and biological 

inputs, increasing employment opportunities particularly for the youth 

•  Greater  social  cohesion  with  farmer  to  farmer  training  and  collaboration  around 
production,  harvesting  and  storage,  sorting,  resulting  in  higher  adoption  rates  of 
agroecological practices and better bargaining prices for farmers 

•  Recycling of rice by decentralized mills, to return to crop fields 

 

85 

•  Greater  economic  prosperity  for  rural  communities  through  community  ownership  of 

• 

small scale milling operations 
Increased food security through more even distribution of milled rice between rural and 
urban 

•  Support  for  traditional  values  and  cultural  and  diet  diversity  through  valuation  of 

traditional rice varieties. 

Few  means  have  been  identified  to  value  these  positive  externalities,  which  build  on  the 
conventional values of rice as commodity with a particular yield and price. 

Governance issues in the value chain from a civil society perspective: Despite FNDAPS' efforts to 
professionalize  the  rice  sector,  there  is  still  work  to  be  done.  Consultation  is  needed  with  all 
development stakeholders by prioritising and involving professional agricultural organisations. 

Proposed policy response: Prevent the depletion of natural resources through land and natural 
resource governance. A national policy to promote the rice value chain must be built on the basis 
of past policy reviews. These assessments must not be a matter for technicians alone: they must 
result  from  participatory  and  inclusive  national  and  decentralized  exercises  involving  all 
stakeholders, including farmers. They must be based on the actions developed at each link in the 
value chain and the governance of the rice sector, the investments made, the financing mobilized, 
their amounts and sources, the objectives targeted, the results achieved and not achieved, the 
strengths  and  weaknesses  identified,  quantitative  and  qualitative  indicators  understood  and 
controlled by all the actors in the sector. The national policy for promoting the rice value chain 
must focus on the problems identified at each link in the value chain and the governance of the 
sector and clearly outline the solutions recommended and the measures taken (Ngalane 2004).

5. Another Road Taken: Articulation of Coherent Policy Responses to 

a New Agricultural Paradigm 
 

Systems of food production around the world are at a crossroads; the current system results in 
food and nutritional insecurity in many regions of the world, alongside epidemics of obesity in 
the  same  and  other  regions.    The  natural  resource  base  to  sustain  food  production  is  being 
severely impacted by practices that degrade ecosystem functions and cause losses of biodiversity, 
making it less able to contend with the impacts of climate change.  Concerns continue to mount 
over the political and economic dimensions of the food system, with instability and uncertainty 
in  the  governance  of  land,  water  and  other  natural  resources,  the  growing  concentration  of 
power in the hands of input suppliers and food retailers, and the difficult working conditions for 
many  workers  along  the  food  value  chain  IPES,  2016 i;  von  Braun  and  Birner,  2017).    These 
concerns are reflected with a wealth of detail in the elucidation of issues along the rice food value 
chain in Senegal, in the previous section. 
 
Increasingly, there have been global calls of a new agricultural paradigm, addressing such issues 
in a coherent manner; many of these calls focus on  agroecological approaches, seen as counter 
to  “business  as  usual”  industrial  agriculture,  and  capable  of  building  food  systems  that 
substantively contribute to achieve global food security and nutrition (FSN) (Caron et al 2018, De 
Schutter,  2010;  FAO  2018b,  HLPE  2016,  2017a  2017b),  while  generating  many  positive 
externalities. 
 
In line with the aims of the “The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity for Agriculture and 
Food” (TEEBAgriFood) initiative, the narrative descriptions of the rice food value chain in Senegal 
in the previous section reveal interdependencies between human (economic and social) systems, 
agriculture and food systems, and biodiversity and ecosystems. Acknowledging that agriculture 
and the way agricultural production is performed affects all areas of development and itself is 
affected by those areas, this section articulates the convergent policy responses proposed in the 
previous  section,  to  be  used  in  an  integrated  and  comparative  scenario  analysis  using  a 
comprehensive simulation model (Section 6).   
 
The first, “Business as Usual” scenario is comprised of current policies and practices in the rice 
Sector in Senegal. The contrasting scenario, comprising an alternative development path, stem 
from the set of policy responses outlined by the different stakeholders in the previous section. 
Despite varied perspectives, the policy responses proposed in the previous section have many 
areas of convergence and can be grouped within the structure the ten elements of Agroecology 
(FAO 2018a).  By grouping the proposed policy responses into the ten elements of Agroecology, 
it is more likely that a coherent articulation of policy measures can be identified and analysed at 

 

87 

once, as single policy measures, given the many interactions between policies, will not have the 
same impact as a more holistic approach. 
 
Thus,  in  this  section  we  have  summarized  and  grouped  the  proposed  policy  interventions 
Senegalese agriculture as proposed within the stakeholder consultation in and more specifically 
their  application  in  the  rice  sector,  with  the  aim  to  then  be  able  to  assess  the  impact  from 
applying  the  proposed  policy  measures  across  the  rice  value  chain,  on  several  relevant 
development indicators, covering the four types of capital and several aspects of the SDGs, and 
in  comparison  to  a  continuation  of  “business  as  usual”.    The  two  approaches  are  further 
characterized in Figures 5 and 6. 
 
Policy Interventions 
 
Efficiency 
1.  Increase  water  resource-use  efficiency  (e.g.  replace  inefficient  with  efficient  irrigation 

equipment)  

This includes for example: 
-  Decrease of expenditure for (inefficient) irrigation equipment frees money for other purposes 
-  Increase of expenditure for efficient irrigation equipment 
-  Support small-scale irrigation equipment 

 

2.  Support the construction of dikes and bunds in the lowlands to retain / manage the "surplus" 

rainwater and control salt 

 
Recycling 
 
3.  Reduce mineral fertilizer and increase natural fertilizer use (e.g. soil fertility enhancement)  
 
This includes for example: 
 

-  Increase of natural fertilizer use (by increasing subsidies, Encourage producers to produce, 
collect and market their own natural fertilizers supporting the implementation of alternative 
approaches (such as the use of organic fertilizer derived from the Non-Sewerage Sanitation 
System along the fecal sludge Management treatment facilities) and training on its production, 
see training on SLM) (also applicable under synergies) 
 

-  Decrease of mineral fertilizer use (by decreasing subsidies) 

 

 

88 

Synergies 
 
1.  Implement agro-livestock integration (for example, integration of fish with rice) 

 

2.  Implement measures to use biological approaches to pest and disease management; Reduce 
pesticide  use  and  increase  integrated  pest  management  (e.g.  botanical  extracts  for  pest 
management) (also applicable under diversity) 

 

Diversity 

 

3.  Diversify production on farm levels, including 

 

-  Promotional  efforts  towards  greater  diversity in  cultivation  and  consumption  of  crops  (for 
example promoting other grains such as millet, maize and fonio instead of focusing on rice 
only,  but  also  the  diversity  within  rice:  high  quality  and  broken  rice  to  match  the  food 
preferences of the Senegalese consumer). 

 

4.  Employ measures that respect the contribution of farmers, particularly from marginalized 

groups, and support ways of increasing the base salary of farmers and farmworkers. 

 

Resilience 

 

5.  Implement  and  invest  in  climate  change  adaptation  (e.g.  local  seed  use,  moisture 

management, research, restore habitats8 etc.). this includes for example: 

 
6.  Enhance  the  provisioning  of  ecosystem  services  while  ensuring  the  social  foundation  for 
inclusive and sustainable development by enabling the implementation of sustainable land 
management  supporting  specifically  small-scale  production,  processing  and  storage  in  a 
holistic way  

 

This includes for example: 
-  Training, awareness raising, research but also access to equipment and credit, investment in 
small  scale  mills  and  community  storage  options,  as  well  as  support  of  marketing  of  AE 
products,  

 

8 We use investments in adaptation for agriculture in a rather broad sense that include covering of adaptation cost 
for agriculture, water supply and natural ecosystems (UNFCCC 2007), respectively agriculture, extreme weather 
events and water supply / flood protection (UNEP 2014a). Based on the mentioned adaptation cost literature these 
adaptation investment needs sum up to around 33-42% of total adaptation investment needs. 

 

89 

-  Support  financial  organizations  to  extend  credit  and  micro-credit  to  provide  preferential 
terms to producers or traders of agroecological products only, and other producers or traders 
otherwise contributing to resilience. 

 
Co-creation of knowledge 
 
7.  Dissemination  of  knowledge  and  technology  without  state  involvement  (e.g.  farmer  to 
farmer  propagation,  dissemination  of  best  practices,  support  the  development  and  the 
official recognition of knowledge provided by the agroecological farms etc.) 

 

 

8.  Support  farmers  institutions  and  community-based  cooperatives  improving  access  to 
training, markets, inputs, capital, information, research, storage and processing options on 
a community level as well as the organization of marketing 

This includes for example: 
-  Increase  farmer  training  of  integrated  and  agroecological  crop  management  options 
(including  systems  of  rice  intensification  in  both  lowland  and  upland  rice),  and  include 
Agroecology  in  Senegal's  national  agricultural  and  education  policies  so,  that  academic 
training and the ongoing training of agricultural extension agents includes agroecology and 
they will be able to support farmers  with the needed skills 

-  Participatory research; Support the development and the official recognition of knowledge 
provided by the agroecological farms; Support research on scaling up agroecology, identifying 
needs by producers as barriers to scaling up, working with research institutions, conducting 
participatory research including producers, capitalizing on results, and to popularize them 

-  Document,  capitalize  and  share  traditional  knowledge  among  producers,  support 
agroecological  community  management  and  more  exchanges  between  agro-ecological 
producers in Senegal and those in countries like Burkina Faso and Benin.  

 
9.  Increase  public  awareness  of  the  potential  for  agroecological  practices  to  protect  the 

environment through the rational management of water and regeneration of soils 

 
Responsible Governance 
 
10. Prevent the depletion of natural resources through land and natural resource governance, 

including reforestation to sustain rice watersheds 

 
11. Develop and apply land management policies, particularly on the part of local government, 
that recognizes legal land ownership by women and youth, and explicitly allocates land for 

 

90 

agroecology, including registration of land designated for agroecology with market values, 
so that land holders have access to credit  

 

12. Empower people, especially women and young people at household, community levels and 
beyond  by  building  knowledge,  through  collective  action  and  creating  opportunities  for 
commercialization (e.g. by promoting their participation in producer groups) 

Circular Economy 

13. Support production and subsidize the provision of small tillers for use in traditional/small-

scale rice fields 
 

14. Support for smaller and medium sized decentralized mills and storage facilities managed by 
the communities (providing benefits, such as capacity for milling by-products to be allocated 
to other uses, such as animal feed, field fertilizers, breweries or other sectors, reduction of 
transportation  costs,  higher  prices  for  producers,  lower  prices  for  consumers,  greater 
market efficiency and availability at the community markets) 

 

(It is noted that this intervention is to some degree inspired by policy in Rwanda, focusing 
on medium sized mills and organizing business models around  these mills.  Such value chain 
developments may be key to the success of this intervention) (Diagne, pers. comm.) 

15. Reconnect producers and consumers by strengthening short food circuits and local markets, 

including small scale production and processing (see culture and food traditions) 

16. Encourage  the  procurement  by  public  services  of  agroecological  rice  (Hospitals,  schools, 

armed forces, prisons, etc.) 

 

Culture and food traditions 

 

 

 

 

 

17. Increase the potential of territories to sustain their peoples by reconnecting food habits and 
culture as well as food production and food consumption (e.g. ensure that rice production 
matches the food preferences of consumer and promote the cultural value of rice in Senegal) 

 
Human and social values 
 
18. Job  creation  through  knowledge  and  labor  intensive  agroecological  production  and  the 

formalization of the sector (see culture and food traditions) 

 

91 

 

19. Develop  and  support  community  seed  banks  at  the  local  level,  including  research, 

inventories, and awareness raising and small-scale seed enterprises 

 

 
 

 

 

6. System dynamics model and scenario definition 
 

In line with the aims of the “The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity for Agriculture and 
Food” (TEEBAgriFood) initiative, the narrative descriptions of the rice food value chain in Senegal 
in the previous section reveal interdependencies between human (economic and social) systems, 
agriculture and food systems, and biodiversity and ecosystems. Acknowledging that agriculture 
and the way agricultural production is performed affects all areas of development and itself is 
affected by those areas, this section provides the results of an integrated scenario analysis using 
a comprehensive simulation model.  
 
In order to elaborate this analysis, the set of convergent policies identified by stakeholders and 
summarized in the section above is simulated with the Senegalese Threshold21-iSDG (T21-iSDG) 
simulation model. The model addresses the challenge of policy impact assessment in the multi-
disciplinary, interconnected and complex nature of development. The fact that policies in one 
sector have an effect on several other sectors and indicators, but not necessarily in a linear way, 
highlight the need for integrated planning across sectors to develop coherent policies (O’Connor 
et al. 2016). The 2030 Development Agenda with the 17 SDGs emphasizes this need. A survey of 
existing modeling tools for integrated assessment (UN 2015) indicates the inability of the best-
known global modeling frameworks to provide a comprehensive perspective on the SDGs; to our 
knowledge the T21-iSDG model is the only scenario tool for national planning addressing the 17 
Goals  (OECD  2016).  By  integrating  the  social,  economic  and  environmental  dimensions  of 
sustainable development into one framework, the T21-iSDG model enables broad, cross-sector, 
long-term analyses of alternative policies for improving development. Hence, the fundamental 
advantage of the model is that it integrates these different dimensions of development and is 
consequently  able  to  represent  the  complex  net  of  interlinkages,  side-effects  and  feedbacks. 
However, to be able to do that, the details within each dimension and sector that are integrated 
in  the  model  have  been  reduced.  That  means  that  the  model  provides  the  framework  for 
assessing,  with  a  macro perspective, the  overall impact  across  sectors  and  spheres,  while the 

 

92 

detailed definition and design for example of the proposed policies is a task of the agricultural 
experts as addressed in the previous section. 
 
It  should  be  noted  that  Section  6.2  below  gives  a  very  high-level  model  presentation  with 
indication about where to find further information (for the whole model especially the "T21 iSDG 
model  documentation"  [MI  2016]  and  for  the  agricultural  sector  the  report  "T21-Senegal: 
Agriculture, Food and Nutrition, and Rural Poverty Scenarios" [MI 2014]). A detailed description 
of the model, the structure of the sectors and the interlinkages can be found in the Threshold 21 
(T21) iSDG Model documentation (MI 2016). 
 
Using  the  simulation  results  of  the  model,  we  assess  the  impact  of  policy  changes  on  a  vast 
amount of development indicators. For this study, we present a selection of those indicators that 
represent areas of each of the four capital dimensions (natural, human, social, and produced), as 
recognized  within  the  TEEB  AgFood  framework  and  that  are  used  at  the  same  time  for  the 
assessment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), considering the importance of these 
SDGs that should guide the development efforts of the world at least over the next decade.  
 
We present and compare the results for the selected indicators under two different scenarios. In 
the  Business  As  Usual  (BAU)  scenario  we  assume  that  current  policies  are  continued  into  the 
future; while in the Agroecology (AE) scenario we mapped the policy recommendations made by 
stakeholders against the Ten Elements of Agroecology, identified by FAO adopted by member 
countries  in  2019  (FAO  2018a  2019).  We  found  strong  resonance  between  the  policy 
recommendations made here and the Ten Elements and have used them as an overall structure 
for comparison between current status and a possible future, with the input from stakeholders 
defining explicit measures within each element. In sum, a comparison is made between: 
 

-  Conventional agriculture scenario / BAU (business-as-usual scenario) assuming no major 

changes in external conditions and a continuation of current government policies.  

-  Agroecological / sustainable agriculture scenario assuming the application of the policy 
responses identified above, within the structure of FAO’s Ten Elements Agroecology in 
the agriculture of Senegal.  

Simulating the model allows us to assess the impact of the two scenarios, and to identify the 
individual contributions of each policy as well as synergies emerging from policy interactions. To 
ensure  that we  assess the  mid-term  impact, we  present the  results for 2050.  Our  explorative 
scenarios are not to be taken as precise forecasts – which are not feasible over the time horizon 
we consider – nor are they meant to be final. They have been designed and analyzed with the

As  the  graphic  indicates,  the  policy  responses  identified  by  stakeholders  in  the  section  above 
have  been  grouped  within  the  ten  agroecological  principles  by  FAO,  to  clarify  differences 
between  these  interventions  and  “business  as  usual”,  in  the  two  comparative  scenarios.  We 
simulate  these  scenarios  using  the  T21-iSDG  model  that  represents  the  system  with  all  the 
relevant interactions, so that the changes diffuse along the causal relations, feedbacks etc. and 
affect the areas of interest, which are the natural, produced, human and social capitals which can 
be linked to the 17 SDGs of the current development agenda. To measure these changes, we 
identified indicators for the four types of capital that are also used for measuring the SDG. 
 
Hence, section 6.1 outlines the methodology used to analyze the two scenarios and includes a 
description  of  the  T21-iSDG  simulation  model,  the  scenarios,  and  the  key  indicators  used  to 
assess performance. In section 6.2 we analyze simulation results. In section 6.3 we summarize 
and discuss the findings, before drawing our conclusions.

6.1. Scenario description and methodology 

 

To answer our central question – the assessment of the impact of the agroecological rice 
interventions on human livelihoods, specifically on the four dimensions of capital – we analyze 
the two scenarios, the Business As Usual (BAU) and Agroecology (AE) scenarios.  

Table  4 presents the policies and assumptions characterizing each scenario. Based on the insights 
of the interviews / the interventions identified in this report, a key set of policy interventions – 
structured around FAO’s Ten Elements of Agroecology - have been identified that were translated 
into  actions  and  assumption  in  the  model.  However,  since  agroecology  constitutes  a  holistic 
approach, where principles and interventions are interlinked, the table also indicates that several 
interventions can be assigned to various elements. The two columns on the right-hand side of 4 
indicate the level of implementation in the two scenarios. The BAU column presents the current 
state of practice (that would be continued into the future) and the value is estimated using the 
last historical data point available or estimates from local experts9. The AE column shows the 
absolute value (not the changes compared to BAU) that is assumed to be implemented in 2020 
(unless otherwise indicated). To maintain the internal logic of the scenarios, the scenarios assume 
the application of the production approaches not only for rice but also for all crops. It should be 
noted that the interventions are applied to all crops, but the impact can vary. In the model, we 
distinguish  between  10  different  crops  (cereals,  fruits,  fibre  crops,  pulses,  tubers,  treenuts, 
vegetables, sugar crops, oilcrops, other crops) [MI 2014]. The partly differing impact, especially 
on water nutrients etc. is based on the historical observed behaviour of the last 25 years). We 
apply the interventions to all crops, since it is also more realistic, that government and farmers 
do not only change for one crop only, but for the whole agricultural sector. This means that the 
impact of the change for one crops is then only a part of the whole impact (as is estimated using 
proxies as per Table 7). 

 
The proposed AE scenario in this study is characterized by a change of farming techniques (e.g. 
implementation  of  agroecological  approaches)  and  the 
inherent  social  and  economic 
consequences (e.g. food autonomy or job creation), that is supported by a shift of government 
expenditure.  These changes in government expenditure are primarily in the realm of investment 
in irrigation, with a reduction of overall expenditure, while investing in higher efficiency, targeting 
smallholders towards key aspects of agroecology (e.g. sustainable land management etc.).  In the 

 

9 In the continuous process of customization of the model to Senegal in collaboration with the Senegalese government, these data are derived by 
using several sources and adjustment calculations to ensure coherency and consistency between them. Data was collected from national and 
local sources (such as Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie [ANSD], Ministry of Agriculture, Direction de l'Analyse, de la 
Prevision et des Statistiques Agricoles [DAPSA], and Consortium pour la Recherche Économique et Sociale [CRES]) as well as international sources 
and databases, including the World Bank (World Development Indicators [WDI]), the United Nations (UN), the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of United Nations (FAO) including FAOSTAT and AQUASTAT, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Energy Information Administration (EIA), and 
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) (see also Millennium Institute 2014). The calculation of the distribution within the agricultural 
budget is mainly based on data provided by the Senegalese Government (Gouvernement de la République du Sénégal 2013a, 2013b, 2011).

BAU scenario (continuation of the current status), government makes a considerable investment 
in water management through enlarging the area equipped for irrigation, but not specifically in 
the increase of efficiency. In the AE scenario, we reduce investment in irrigation but focus with 
this investment the increase of efficiency. Hence, in AE scenario, we reduce expenditure, and the 
area equipped with irrigation is not increased as fast as in BAU, but efficiency increases faster. 
Such a change in investment results in reducing total government expenditure of around 0.6% of 
GDP (the policies of this list sum up to 2.69% of GDP in the BAU and 2.07% in the AE scenario), 
thus alleviating national indebtedness.  (It should be noted that the estimated expenditure for 
BAU is based on data from the government reflecting high investments in the recent years for 
irrigation, and subsidies for fertilizer, pesticides and seeds.

10 The parameters presented in the final two columns have been the result of extensive data searches and discussions between the modeler and 
the agricultural experts involved in this study.  Explanation of policy variables is included in an annexed table (Annex 1).Data has been 
documented in a separate excel spreadsheet. This table includes all the interventions that are simulated and presents the expenditure that is 
assumed to be used in the two scenarios for the interventions (for example in BAU 1.85% of GDP for irrigation equipment, and in AE 0,15% of 
GDP for increasing ag water efficiency)

13 Calculated through simulating the irrigation coverage (as ha of irrigated land taking into account construction and maintenance cost) and use 
for the different scenarios the different assumptions about the investment by the government (as % of GDP) 
14 In the AE scenario we invest less money for enlarging the area of irrigation (instead of 1.85% in the BAU only 0.15% in AE, but the money that 
we invest (the 0.15%), we invest in increasing the efficiency) 
15 Based on the assumption that the money spent in BAU for mineral fertilizer subsidies is spent in AE for natural fertilizer subsidies and that this 
leads to the indicated changes in natural fertilizer use (from 0.03 ton/ha/year in BAU to 0.63 ton/ha/year in AE)

6.2. T21-iSDG model: representation of the system 

The T21-iSDG model (MI 2016) was constructed starting from the well-vetted, time tested and 
validated Threshold21 (T21) model that has evolved over the past 30 years through research 
and application by the Millennium Institute (Barney 2002; Pedercini et al. 2017). The model for 
Senegal was customized for the first time in 2009 in collaboration with the Government of 
Senegal (Gouvernement de la République du Sénégal 2014). Since then, the model has been 

 

19 We use the indicator “Women’s Economic Opportunity” (WEO) Index created by the Economist Intelligence Unit (2012) to measure progress 
in the economic advancement of women. It draws on data from a wide range of international organizations, including the UN, the IMF, the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Health Organization (WHO), the FAO, and many others. 
20 A value less than one means that the disparities in employment rates are lower than in completions of education; and a value greater than one 
vice versa. 
21 We use the indicator “Voice and Accountability” that captures perceptions of the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in 
selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and a free media. It is one of the six broad dimensions that 
are used for the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) provided by the World Bank (Kaufmann et al 2017). 

 

99 

continuously updated and used22, as well as significantly enlarged and improved, for example in 
the areas of agriculture and SDG assessment23.  

 
The  T21-iSDG  model  is  a  System  Dynamics  based  model  for  comprehensive  and  participatory 
development planning. The model integrates economic, social, and environmental factors, and 
represents  the  important  elements  of  complexity  –  feedback  relationships,  non-linearity  and 
time delays – that are fundamental for effectively addressing development issues. The model can 
be  customized  to  country-specific  conditions,  and  simulates  the  medium-  and  long-term 
consequences of alternative policies at the national level. Hence, it allows for easy comparison 
to  reference  scenarios,  so  to  serve  as  a  participatory  tool  in  consensus  building  and  policy 
discussions  (Pedercini  2005;  Pedercini  and  Barney  2010;  UNEP  2014b).  Figure  9  provides  a 
conceptual overview of the T21-iSDG model structure, which includes 30 interacting sectors. 
 

 

22 Several studies and reports elaborated within the intensive collaboration with the directorate of planning in the Directorate General for 
Planning and Economic Policy (Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan in Senegal) can be found at the homepage 
(www.plandev.sn/publications.html), such as the analysis of the progress towards the SDGs (Direction de la Planification et al 2017). 
23 These improvements have been facilitated amongst others by the “Changing Course in Global Agriculture” (CCGA) project that is a joint project 
of Millennium Institute and Biovision Foundation, and implemented in Senegal in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry 
of Economy, Finance and Plan, see http://www.biovision.ch/en/projects/international/ccga-changing-course-in-global-agriculture/.

Figure 9 - Conceptual overview of T21-iSDG Sectors 

 

 

Economic activities (blue circle) take place within society (red circle), from which social resources 
are  drawn  to  generate  economic  value,  and  within  the  broader  natural  environment  (green 
circle), which contributes sources and sinks of natural resources, emissions, and waste. All sectors 
interact dynamically; a change in one sector leads to impacts over time on all other sectors. This 
feedback-rich structure endogenously determines the behavior of the model, as economic, social, 
and environmental indicators respond to the accumulation or decay of resources over time. For 
detailed  information  about  the  model  structure  and  individual  sectors,  please  refer  to  MI 
(2016).24 
 
In addition to these key sectors, the T21-iSDG-Senegal is enriched by 19 special sectors that were 
developed  and  specifically  included  to  better  represent  development  dynamics  particularly 
interesting for long-term planning in Senegal. The table below lists the special sectors of the T21-
iSDG-Senegal. Most special sectors are suitable for analyzing agricultural and rural development 
aspects  and  its  social  and  environmental  impacts.  A  simplified  summary  of  this  structure

Policy Implementation Mechanism 
 
The  T21-iSDG  model  for  Senegal  explicitly  represents  the  causal  structure  that  links  policy 
interventions  to  eventual  impacts  on  key  performance  indicators.  Following  a  results  chain 
approach  (UNDP,  2009),  budgetary  interventions  in  the  model  are  introduced  in  the  form  of 
additional investment allocated to specific activities. Over time, those activities are implemented 
and produce specific outputs and outcomes, which subsequently generate broader impacts on 
key  performance  indicators.  For  instance,  increasing  investment  for  training  of  farmers  in 
sustainable  land  management  causes  an  increase  in  the  number  of  farmers  being  enrolled  in 
training  programs,  gradually  building  capacity  in  that  area.  Over  time,  that  leads  to  more 
sustainable  land  management  practices,  and  to  other  positive  impacts  on  a  variety  of  socio-
economic indicators. 
 
Validation 
 
The  model  underwent  an  intensive  validation  process  involving  structural  and  behavioral 
validation  tests  (Barlas  1996).  Structural  validation  involved  direct  verification  of  structural 
assumptions  and  parameters.  Behavioral  validation  involved  the  assessment  of  the  model’s 
ability to replicate the historical behavior of the main indicators for the period from 1990 until 

  102 

now25. The residual error from comparison with historical data is analyzed and broken down by 
component using Theil’s statistics (Sterman 1984) to verify the model’s ability to capture medium 
and  longer-term  trend  in  data.  For  this  assessment  a  database  of  more  than  1000  variables 
relating to all spheres and sectors was elaborated using national and international sources9 and 
adjusting them if necessary to ensure coherency and consistency between them.  Nevertheless, 
the model’s results inherently embed a high degree of uncertainty, due to the long time horizon 
of the simulation, and the large number of indirectly estimated parameters. Over such long time 
horizon, in fact, a large variety of unforeseeable changes can take place, and a large number of 
parameters might take on different values than those observed in the past, driven by elements 
outside the scope of the model. Consequently, simulation results are not to be taken as exact 
forecasts (no model can accurately forecast long-term development trends) but as reasonable 
and coherent projections, based on a set of clear and well-grounded assumptions. 
 
 

6.2.  Key indicators: measurement of the impact 

  

We first present the impact of the interventions on key indicators and explain then (in Figure 9) 
how these indicators are connected to the interventions in rice / agriculture.  
 
To  assess  the  more  direct  effect  of  the  scenarios  described  above,  we  first  present  two  key 
production indicators in the cereal sector (cereal yield and cereal production in tons). In a second 
step,  we  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  policy  changes  on  the  whole  system  by  analyzing  the 
performance  of  a  sub-set  of  indicators  listed  in  Table  6.  They  were  selected  based  on  the 
following  criteria:  coverage  of  four  types  of  capital,  interesting  and  relevant  results,  and 
relevance for the SDGs. We included the SDG relevance as criteria since they are the goals for the 
current overall development agenda and also because basing our choice on the results of the 
extensive discussions about appropriate indicators to measure the achievement of these  goals 
increases our confidence of a meaningful selection. Only four indicators per dimension of capital 
have been selected from a longer list to increase readability and clarity of understanding of this 
report.

26 Number of indicators in “Final list of proposed Sustainable Development Goal Indicators” (UN 2016). 
27 This metric is based on the identification of indicators by the UN for measuring the SDGs (UN 2016)  
28 FAO (2019a) 
29 World Bank (2019) 
30 To understand how this is captured in the model: for example in 2050, more than 35% of yearly deforestation is reduced in AE scenario 
compared to BAU in the, while reforestation mainly only exists in AE scenario since there is no significant investment in BAU for that, while the AE 
scenario includes investment in reforestation. 
31 FAO (2019b) 
32 As per results with the application of SRI, a 100% reduction in pesticides had been shown to have no impact on productivity; this is clearly an 
assumption, but backed up by documentation in Senegal and beyond.  Thus the AE scenario models a 100% reduction, whereas BAU continues 
current trends. 
33 Using total pesticide use (FAOSTAT) we apply a pesticide dispersion rate of 35% to calculate pesticide dispersion and divide it by total 
population (ANSD, WPP) to derive the per capita amount. 
34 UN (2017) 
35 We calculate unemployment rate by dividing total employment (WDI) by labor force using the labor participation rate (WDI) and total 
population (ANSD, WPP). 
36 In the model, growth rate has no effect on productivity but is rather calculated using the simulated production (that is affected by capital, 
employment and total factor productivity). However, of course such an increase in production leads to higher household and government 
revenue and allows for example more investment (see positive feedback loop that has been previously). 
37 Although it is proposed to use as indicator for measuring the SDG the annual growth rate of real per capita GDP, we analyze the amount of real 
per capita GDP since the growth rate mainly gives an indication about the change with regard to the last year while our interest in this long-term 
analysis concerns the long-term development.

7. Results of scenario simulation: Impact on four types of capital 
 
In  this  section  we  present  the  results  of  the  scenarios  described  above  for  the  selected  key 
indicators.  We  first  describe  the  direct  effect  on  cereal  yield  and  production  and  explain  the 
reasons for change, before providing an overview of the impact on the four dimensions of capital 
in 2050. This is followed by an analyses in detail of the results for each of the selected indicators 
pointing also to the causal relations. Finally, we summarize the identified causalities in a causal 
diagram. 
  
Direct effect on cereal yield and cereal production: The more direct effect of the changes of the 
simulated policies is illustrated in Figure 9 (below) presenting for two key production indicators 
in the cereal sector the data for 2017 (blue column) and the simulated results for 2030 and 2050 
for the BAU scenario (red column) and AE scenario (green column).

BAU and AE scenario) 

 

Systemic effects: First of all, the comparison reveals that the proposed policy changes generate 
a significant improvement in the AE scenario compared to the BAU scenario, increasing yield by 

  105 

around 48% in 2030 and around 69% in 2050,  and cereal38 production by around 61% in 2030 
and around 93%, in other words nearly doubling production, in 2050. One important factor is the 
strong increase in public expenditure for sustainable land management that includes investment 
for training, awareness raising, and research but also for access to equipment and credit, in small 
scale mills and community storage options (decreasing for example the waste share), as well as 
support of marketing of AE products39. These options for increased public investment are made 
possible, in part, as the government turns from investing, and then servicing, large debts for large 
scale  agribusiness  schemes,  to  investing  in  smaller  scale  projects that deliver  water  efficiency 
infrastructure  to  rice  growing  communities;  the  amount  saved  on  debt  payments  frees  up 
resources  for  such  investments40.    These  policies  in  combination  with  higher  expenditure  for 
farmers’ organization, knowledge dissemination from farmer to farmer, increased use of natural 
fertilizer  and  biological  pest  control  as  well  as  improvements  in  land  tenure  lead  to  higher 
productivity,  additional  employment  and  more  sustainable  food  production.  In  addition, 
harvested  area  is  increased  by  around  14%  in  2050  in  the  AE  scenario  compared  to  the  BAU 
scenario, one of the main reasons being a reduction of land degradation and land abandonment 
caused by the increase of land that is sustainably managed and the increase of jobs. It is assumed 
that  due  to  an  increase  of  area  sustainably  managed  (for  example  driven  by  training),  land 
degradation decreases, increasing harvested area, with no increase in deforestation. Agriculture 
production  is  further  increased  by  agro-livestock  integration  and  investment  in  agricultural 
adaptation,  reducing  the  negative  impact  of  climate  change  on  agricultural  productivity 
especially in the long term. 
 
Secondly, the results point to the fact that the improvement increases over time, both for the 
results  in  the  AE  scenario  comparing  today  with  2030  and  2050,  and  for  the  difference  in 
performance  between  the  two  scenarios  comparing  2030  and  2050.  The  policies  in  the  AE 
scenario  activate  some  positive  feedback  loops  that  continuously  reinforce  the  original 
improvement.  One  of  these  important  feedback  loops  concerns  investment:  the  increase  of 
agriculture production leads to an increase of household revenue that also allows an increase of 
investment in other sectors, leading to higher production there, contributing to a higher GDP, 
and allowing for more investment in the three sectors, reinforcing the growth of GDP41. Another 
key example refers to the importance of governmental services: the increased GDP also leads to 

 

38 As noted previously, cereals is simulated as one of ten crop categories in the existing model for Senegal and thus is an umbrella proxy for the 
impacts due to changes in rice production (see Table 7). Modelling specifically rice would not have been possible within the scope / resources of 
this study. 
39 In this exercise, the impact of the measures is based on expert knowledge / literature. We do not assume a certain stable increase of 
productivity of each measure but instead a reasonable change in the variable affected by the interventions. For example, training increases the 
‘harvested area sustainably managed’ with its positive effects on soil nutrient balance.  
40 Amounts of these investments (expenditure as % of GDP) are described in Table 4. 
41 The specific changes in public investment between the two scenarios are described in Table 4. All the changes described in this analysis are 
due to the combination of these described interventions. For private investment, for example, the combination of all policies lead to an increase 
of around 9% in the AE scenario compared to the BAU scenario in 2050. 

  106 

higher government revenue enabling more government investment, for example in education, 
health,  infrastructure,  increasing  productivity  and  consequently  GDP.  Hence,  the  AE  scenario 
generates  effects that  diffuse  to the whole  system,  improving even  indicators  that  are  rather 
indirectly  linked  to  agriculture  and  this  improvement  grows  over  time  due  to  the  activated 
reinforcing feedback loops.  
 
Third, the simulation results indicate an important insight concerning the trend of the production: 
while  yield  and  production  continue  to  increase  in  the  AE  scenario  until  2050,  the  observed 
improvement in the BAU scenario in 2030 (compared to the current data of 2017) decreases until 
2050. This is mainly caused by the negative effect of climate change on agriculture productivity 
decreasing yield by around 20% in 2050 in BAU scenario while the investment in climate change 
adaptation in agriculture in the AE scenario decreases the negative impact of climate change and 
mitigates  this  reduction.  In  addition,  we  observe  a  slight  decreasing  trend  of  harvested  area 
starting around 2030 that is caused by both the decreasing return on investment in agriculture 
reducing demand for cultivating agriculture land, and land degradation and abandonment42. The 
policies implemented in the AE scenario reduce the decrease of harvested area by addressing 
both factors. For example, the increase of sustainable land management results in a decrease of 
land degradation and abandonment, and the joint implementation of several policies (see above 
and below) increase agriculture production to a higher degree than investment leading to higher 
return on investment.  
 
Hence, while we encounter impeding and counteracting growth factors in the BAU scenario, we 
can alleviate those in the AE scenario so that the activated positive feedback loops increase the 
initiated improvement over time, pointing to the higher degree of sustainable growth in the AE 
scenario compared to the BAU scenario. Comparing the two scenarios, better long-term results 
are attained for the key indicators (Table 6) using even less public resources for agriculture (see 
Table 4) pointing to the fact that the proposed interventions of AE scenario are more effective 
than those in BAU scenario. For a better understanding, Figure 11 provides a visualization of the 
described  causalities  summarizing  not  only  the  causal  relationships  that  we  identified  in  this 
section but also those that are outlined when analyzing the impact. 
 

 

42 Within the model, the relative return on investment is calculated that affects the agricultural land demand and consequently additional 
conversion to agriculture land.  It should be noted that In both scenarios the relative return on investment (current ROI compared to first positive 
ROI, as production compared to capital) is decreasing for the agricultural sector. However, the decrease is smaller in the AE scenario than in the 
BAU scenario (because of higher production in the AE scnenario).

Table 7 presents the results for key indicators of the four types of capital in 2050 as change in the 
AE scenario compared to the BAU scenario, assuming the application of the AE principles to total 
crop production (third column), and respectively to rice production only (fifth column)43. 
 
Example  for  interpretation:  The  simulation  results  indicate  that  in  2050,  the  cereal  import 
dependency ratio is 21% lower in the AE scenario compared to the BAU scenario. Applying the 
share of rice to cereal production in tons, it is calculated that if only rice production is changed 
(implementing the AE principles only for rice) cereals import quantity reduces by 9% (compared 
to BAU scenario). (Figure 12). 

 

43 It should be noted that changes to all types of crop are modeled because it might be more realistic that agroecological changes are not only 
applied to one special crop (e.g. if subsidies are for natural fertilizer instead of mineral fertilizer this is probably not only for one crop). Also, the 
model does not have rice as a separate crop. However, the model distinguishes between 10 different crop types and the effect of water, 
nutrients etc. differs accordingly.  The final column of this table addresses estimated changes due to rice production alone.

8. Conclusions and limitations  
 
Conclusions:  Our  analysis  estimates  the  impact  of  different  agrocecological  policies  and  their 
combinations on several relevant development indicators in Senegal, covering the four types of 
capital (natural, produced, human and social, see TEEB 2018) and several aspects of the SDGs. 
Further,  our  approach  and  framework  help  to  create  a  better  understanding  of  the 
interconnectedness of the  rice system with its various sectors, indicators and causalities, thus 
facilitating  the  identification  of  synergies  among  interventions  and  impeding  factors  that  can 
make  policies  less  effective.  In  these  ways,  our  analysis  and  the  use  of  the  T21-iSDG  model 
contribute to the understanding of the interdependencies between human (economic and social) 
systems, agriculture and food systems, and biodiversity and ecosystems. Hence, it contributes to 
the TEEBAgriFood initiative providing additional quantitative evidence supporting some of the 
key findings of the TEEBAgriFood study (TEEB 2018) and providing an example of effective and 
coherent  strategies  to  contribute  to  sustainable  development,  in  the  agricultural  sector  and 
beyond.  Below  is  a  summary  of  our  findings,  a  discussion  of  limitations,  and  finally  a  set  of 
recommendations for policy makers and practitioners.  
 
1)  The  agri-food  system  is  highly  interlinked  with  other  sectors:  The  results  illustrate  the 
interlinked nature of the system and reveal that the changes implemented in agriculture 
spread  and  diffuse  through  the  whole  system.  Analyzing  the  reasons  for  changes,  we 
identified  a  complex  net  of  interactions  and  dependencies  that  we  summarize  in  a  causal 
diagram that visualizes the main relations (see section 3.4), and Figure 13 below. In Senegal, 
all  the  proposed  policies  contribute  to  the  changes,  while  their  impact  on  the  different 
indicators varies. For example, one very important policy for the changes in cereal production 
(produced  capital)  is  the  government  expenditure  for  sustainable  land  management 
combined with greater investment in the dissemination of knowledge among farmers, while 
the fundamental change in pesticide dispersion (natural and human capital) is mainly due to 
the  strong  reduction  of  subsidies  for  chemical  fertilizer.  An  important  contribution  to  the 
improvement  of  completion  rate  in  secondary  school  (human  capital)  is  generated  by the 
empowerment of women (supporting gender equality in land tenure rights, employment and 
education), whereas other policies are especially relevant for the reduction of poverty (social 
capital),  such  as  the  job  creation  through  knowledge  and  labor  intensive  agroecological 
production  and  the  formalization  of  the  sector  in  combination  with  the  diversification  of 
production improving income and its distribution.  
 

2)  AE interventions are highly effective: The implementation of the proposed policies generate 
a significant improvement of all selected indicators for the four dimensions of capital in the 
AE  scenario  compared  to  the  BAU  scenario,  increasing  for  example  yield  for  cereals  on 
average by around 48% in 2030 and around 69% in 2050, respectively cereal production by 
around  61%  in  2030  and  around  93%,  in  other words nearly  doubling production,  in 2050 
(Figure 10). However, as shown in Table 7,  of course the scale of change  in the indicators 
differs and ranges in 2050 from around 8% [total water withdrawal per unit of GDP] to 100% 
[percent  pesticide  dispersin  in  environment]  absolute  change  when  assuming  that  AE  is 

  111 

applied to all crops, and 1% to 66% absolute change for the same indicators when assuming 
AE is applied to rice only. Searching for reasons for the different intensity of change in the 
indicators  from  the  BAU  values,  the  simulation  results  suggest  that  the  more  indirect  the 
relationship the lower the difference (in relative and not necessarily in absolute terms). This 
explains why we  find  the  highest  difference  (assuming only  changes  in the  rice  sector)  on 
average  for  the  selected  indicators  of  the  natural  capital  with  around  17%  and  produced 
capital with around 16%, while the mean change for the chosen indicators of social capital is 
around  5%  and  for  human  capital  around  2%  compared  to  the  BAU  scenario  (although  of 
course  the  selection  of  other  indicators  could  change  the  mean  values).  In  any  case,  the 
simulation  results  indicate  remarkable  changes  for  the  more  direct  indicators  such  as 
pesticide dispersion in the environment that can be reduced by around 66% or cereal yield 
and production, as mentioned above, but also concerning more indirectly related indicators, 
such as the indicators for human capital that are improved by around 2% only by the changes 
in rice production. 
 
To better comprehend the inner workings of the model, reference can be made to the causal 
loop diagram of Figure 13, which shows why adoption of AE causes changes in the indicators 
within the 4 forms of capital. The figure is not all encompassing but shows some of the key 
causal  chains  embodied  in  the  simulation  model.  The  indicators  are  shown  in  italics  (the 
names of the indicators are shortened for space).  
 

 
Figure 13. Causal loop diagram of adoption of agroecological approaches. 
The arrows show causal linkages. The polarity of the arrows indicates the direction of causality. A positive polarity indicates 
that  the  connected  variable  tend  to  move  in  the  same  direction.  For  example,  if  cereal  production  increases  then  Food 
availability will increase A negative polarity indicates that the connected variables will tend to move in opposite directions. 
For example, if Pesticide dispersal increases (decreases) then Biodiversity will decrease (increase).

A  simplified  narrative  following  this  causal  chain  (as  there  are  many  potential  pathways 
illustrated)  is  that  with  the  adoption  of  AE  pesticide  dispersal  decreases,  encouraging 
biodiversity along with pollinators and insect predators to proliferate. Natural pest predators 
will boost cereal yields and production over the long term. Farm income is increased with 
improved production and reduced use of external inputs that is associated with AE. Also, AE 
farmers  are  less  vulnerable  to  price  surges  of  inputs.    Poverty  incidence  is  decreased  and 
recognition of the benefits of AE puts into place a reinforcing feedback loops that increase 
the AE adoption rate.   AE practices build soil organic matter that increases soil moisture and 
yields, adding another reinforcing feedback loop to the AE adoption process.  The added soil 
moisture  creates  the  potential  to  lessen  total  water  withdrawals.  Improved  soil  organic 
matter also mitigates land degradation and the need to clear forest for agriculture, thereby 
helping preserve forest cover. Other indicators are driven by AE adoption. Reduced poverty 
from  AE  encourages  completion  of  secondary  education  and  helps  empower  women. 
Improved  farm  incomes  make  farming  a  more  viable  employment  opportunity,  increasing 
agricultural  employment  and  reducing  the  unemployment  rate  in  aggregate.  The  lower 
unemployment  rate  can  lessen  the  risk  of  conflict-related  violence.  Increased  cereal 
production and farm incomes improve availability and access of food and help reduce under 
5 mortality. GDP will grow with improved cereal production.  Increased cereal production has 
the  potential  to  reduce  cereal  import  dependence  and  the  government’s  need  to  borrow 
funds for imports, reducing interest payments on public debt, freeing fund to be invested in 
farmer  trainer,  small  scale  water  management  systems  and  small  and  medium  sized  rice 
processing facilities. 

 

 

3)  Spill-over  effects  are  significant:  The  spill-over  effect  to  other  sectors,  especially  also  to 
other  production  sectors  is  highly  relevant  since  the  simulation  results  reveal  that  the 
contribution  of  agriculture  decreases  over  time,  for  example  concerning  GDP  or 
employment. While agriculture used to be a key sector for employment (in 1990 contributing 
around 60% to total employment) and is still very important (in 2010 around 49% of total 
employment), the decreasing contribution is likely to continue. According to our simulation, 
total employment in 2050 is split into around 57% for services, 24% for industries, and 19% 
for agriculture. In other words, services and agriculture more or less exchange their role for 
total employment. Similarly, the importance of agriculture for GDP follows a decreasing trend 
(accounting  for  around  19%  in  1990,  14%  in  2014,  and  4%  in  2050),  while  the  share 
contributed by industries (22% in 1990, 23% in 2014, and 36% in 2050) and services (59% in 
1990, 63% in 2014, and 60% in 2050) increases over time so that even the rather indirectly 
generated  changes  are  significant.  This  leads  to  the  situation  that  for  example  the 
improvement  in  industry  and  service  production  contribute  around  two  third  to  the 

  113 

additional  GDP  produced  in  the  AE  scenario  compared  to  the  BAU  scenario,  although  the 
changes between the two scenarios only concern the implementation of the agroecological 
principles in the agriculture sector. Hence, the diffusion of effects – triggered by changes in 
agriculture  but  initiating  momentum  also  in  other  sectors  –  is  substantial  for  the  positive 
development  of  overall  indicators  in  the  long  term.  However,  despite  the  decreasing 
importance of agriculture for employment and value added in the long-term, the enduring 
relevance  of  agriculture  and  which  methods  it  applies  is  beyond  controversy:    for 
employment (as mentioned currently for 50% of employment), especially for the poor, and 
of course for food production and the impact on the environment emerging in this process.  
 

implemented  policies 

4)  Policy  impacts  are  amplified  over  time:  The  improvement  in  the  AE  scenario  regarding 
several  indicators  increases  over  time  due  to  the  reinforcing  action  of  a  set  of  positive 
feedback  loops.  The  increasing  improvement  refers to  both the  results in the  AE  scenario 
comparing today with 2030 and 2050, and to the difference in performance between the two 
scenarios comparing 2030 and 2050. This can be explained by some positive feedback loops 
that  were  triggered  by  the 
in  agriculture  and  subsequently 
continuously  reinforce  the  original  improvement.  For  example,  the  increase  of  agriculture 
production  leads  to  an  increase  of  GDP  that  allows  higher  government  revenue  enabling 
higher  government  expenditure  for  more  government  services,  for  example  in  education, 
health, infrastructure, increasing productivity and consequently GDP. Similarly, the increase 
of GDP raises household revenue and facilitates higher investments also in other production 
sectors, reinforcing the original improvement. Hence, the AE scenario generates effects that 
diffuse to the whole system, improving even indicators that are rather indirectly linked to 
agriculture and this improvement grows over time due to the activated reinforcing feedback 
loops.  
 

5)  The outlook in the BAU scenario is alarming: The results indicate for the BAU scenario that 
after  2030  counteracting  factors  lead  to  a  reduction  of  crops  production  (in  tons  and  in 
monetary  terms).  After  a  decade  of  increase  of  crops  production  (for  example  for  cereal 
production in tons of around 24% in 2030 compared to the level of 2017) the negative effects 
of  climate  change  on  agriculture,  and  a  slight  decreasing  trend  of  harvested  area  starting 
around 2030 cause a decreasing tendency reaching in 2050 approximately the level of 2020 
again. Since the reasons for the decrease are addressed in the AE scenario (for example by 
remarkable  expenditure  in  climate  change  adaptation  for  agriculture),  and  consequently 
alleviate these impeding factors in the AE scenario, the resulting growth is more sustainable 
in the AE scenario than in the BAU scenario.

6)  A set of counteracting factors offset benefits in the AE scenario: The analysis reveals some 
areas  where  unintended  side-effects  counteract  positive  developments  also  in  the  AE 
scenario.  For  example,  agricultural  water  withdrawal  in  2050  is  very  similar  in  the  two 
scenarios, despite the remarkable increase of water efficiency reducing water withdrawal per 
hectare of irrigated harvested land by around 40%.  This is due to the fact that the harvested 
area  using  the  efficient  irrigation  methods  is  increased.    Of  course,  this  increase  also 
contributes to the increase in crop production and the following positive effects, but at the 
same time it counteracts the improved water efficiency so that agricultural water withdrawal 
is not significantly reduced. Similarly, the results for cereal dependency ratio indicate that 
even significant improvements in growth (such as the increase of cereal production) may be 
inhibited  by  the  strong  growth  of  the  population.  While  we  observe  a  decrease  of  cereal 
import dependency from around 56% in 2012 to around 43% in 2030 in the AE scenario, the 
dependency starts to increase again after 2030 to more than 60% in 2050 due to the fact that 
population  growth  exceeds  cereal  production  growth.  Hence,  the  increase  in  production 
reduces  the  dependency  in  the  AE  scenario  compared  to  the  BAU  scenario  (where  cereal 
import dependency increases to around 63% in 2030 and even around 80% in 2050), but this 
reduction is counteracted by the population growth (doubling population according to our 
simulations  from  currently  around  16million  to  more  than  32million  people  in  2050).  The 
results suggest that population growth not only creates higher demand for cereals, but also 
for other services such as education and health at the micro and macro level, which is to be 
expected.  
 

7)  Synergies  between    many  proposed  policies  positively  contribute  to  development:  The 
simulation  results  reveal  that  synergies  strengthen  the  improvement  in  the  AE  scenario 
revealing that the proposed policies  support rather than counteract each other. Synergies 
mean that the results of the joint  implementation of all policies is higher than the sum of 
achievement  of  each  single  policy.  Such  synergies  can  be  caused  by  various  mechanisms 
through which a policy leads to better enabling conditions for another policy. For example for 
crop production, large synergies emerge from the interaction of productivity improvement 
(sustainable land management, natural fertilizer use, Integrated Pest Management – IPM – 
and  knowledge  dissemination  by  farmers),  enlargement  of  cultivated  area  (through  agro-
livestock integration and reduction of land degradation), and the decrease of negative effects 
from climate change (adaptation). The synergies indicate that the AE scenario is composed 
of concerted interventions building a comprehensive scenario. 

 

8)  The inertia of the system slows down development:  The analysis point to significant delays 
between policy and effect emphasizing the need for quick action. For example, while the 
strong  increase  of  expenditure for reforestation  starting  in 2019  quite  quickly  facilitates  a 

  115 

break  with  the  decreasing  trend  in  forest  cover,  it  takes  more  than  10  years  to  initiate  a 
reversal  of  that  trend  that  we  observe  only  after  2030.  Similarly,  the  improvement  of 
completion  rate  (%  of  population  in  the  age  of  20-24  that  completed  secondary  school) 
caused by the increase of female enrollment also starts to be visible only after 2030. Such 
results indicate the time needed for immediate changes in specific intervention areas, such 
as forest growth, regeneration of land and soil, but also education and training, stressing the 
urgency of action. 
 

9)  The proposed interventions are not sufficient: The generated improvements are significant 
but  also  indicate  need  for  additional  policies  (in  other  sectors).  For  example,  the 
implementation of the proposed policies can significantly reduce poverty by nearly 30% in 
2050 in the AE scenario compared to the BAU scenario. However, according to the simulation, 
still 10% of the population in 2050 in the AE scenario lives below the poverty line, highlighting 
the need for additional policies addressing for example distribution and unemployment in 
other sectors, to eliminate poverty as it is for example the goal of the 2030 Agenda. Similarly, 
the observation concerning counteracting effects suggests that policies to slow population 
growth  (e.g.  female  education,  access  to  contraceptives)  could  be  useful  to  avoid  that 
improvements  for  the  population  (such  as  the  increase  of  revenue,  food  production, 
education  or  health  services  provided  by  the  government  etc.)  are  impeded  by  growth  in 
population.   

 
10)  A comprehensive long-term analysis is essential: The analysis affirms the imperative of a 
holistic  impact  assessment  that  reviews  the  interdependencies  between  different 
dimensions of capital, as it is requested by TEEB. The analysis shows that a systems modeling 
approach can support this initiative by contributing to such an investigation that take into 
account  the  interactions  between  various  sectors  and  indicators  of  development,  that 
integrates feedback loops, time delays, and enables the identification of synergies. Revealing 
the  importance  of  these  aspects,  the  analysis  shows  that  neglecting  them  will  limit  the 
produced insights. Further, such integrated analysis demonstrating the widespread and long-
term impact can be helpful for increasing acceptance for interventions that first need effort 
and  generate  positive  effects  only  with  a  long  delay.  Such  an  example  is  the  increase  of 
expenditure for reforestation that initially mainly increases government expenditure without 
a  visible  effect  on  forest  cover,  while  the  results  show  that  the  positive  impact  in  2050  is 
remarkable (increasing forest land by around one million hectare in 20 years, approximately 
the amount that has been destroyed in the last two decades). Hence, indicating the long-term 
effects may help to implement policies that really increase sustainability. 

 
Limitations:  

  116 

 
Using a cost-benefit valuation approach to assessing true costs of rice production: Attributing 
costs  and  benefits  to  rice  production  systems  is  in  itself  extremely  difficult,  with  many  costs 
unaccounted for (such as costs to human health from pesticides, or fertilizer runoff in water) and 
many  benefits  unable  to  be  monetized  (such  as  biodiversity  benefits  from  pesticide-free  rice 
paddies or the cultural value of rice in Senegal).  
 
We recognize that we could for example take the few monetary values that we have (revenue 
per  tonne  of  rice  under  contrasting  production  systems  avg  water  consumption  cost  under 
contrasting  systems-  cost  of  burning  rice  revenues  versus  not  burning  +  benefit  of  rice  straw 
incorporated  versus  exported)  to  compare  between  our  two  alternatives  (as  per  data  in  the 
annexed spreadsheet).  Doing so would result in the following calculation:

but we are not convinced that this approach is insightful.   So many more elements of the rice 
sector in Senegal that are centrally important may be well known, and may even be reasonably 
well documented, yet cannot enter into such a cost-benefit analysis.  An example might be risks 
of  pesticides  to  human  health;  as  noted  above,  a  comprehensive  approach  to  pesticide  risk 
assessment in West Africa was published in 2014, which found that in Senegal in 2007 and in 
2010,  no  irrigated  rice  perimeters  met  acceptable  levels  of  pesticide  risk  to  both  human  and 

  117 

wildlife health (Jepson et al. 2014).  While the relative toxicity of the pesticides involved are well 
documented, this is not translated into the expected costs to human or environmental health. 
Equally the costs and benefits of government investing in small and medium sized mills and more 
localized distribution channels are not captured in this format- for example the differences for 
women  and  youth  employment  from  community  ownership.  The  application  of  the 
TEEBAgriFood Framework includes identifying, beyond costs and benefits, but also impacts and 
dependencies; an initial identification of these in rice production systems was completed in the 
first TEEBAgriFood Rice pilot study, provided here in Annex 3.  We would suggest that such a 
table does not do full justice to the outcomes of different management systems and that the 
impacts  and  dependencies  –  throughout  the  food  value  chain  –  is  well  captured  through  the 
application of the T21 systems model and its outcomes.  While a cost/benefit form of true cost 
assessment has value and should still be pursued, but it is not the only form of analysis, nor may 
it be the one of most direct interest to policy makers. 
 
Applicability of results: The dynamics and relations captured in this  model are largely generic 
interconnections,  thus  it  can  be  assumed  that  they  also  generate  similar  dynamics  in  other 
countries (although of course the concrete scale of generated change will be dependent on the 
country-specific  circumstances,  the  currently  implemented  policies  and  the  proposed  policy 
changes).  
 
Spatial elements: The T21-iSDG Senegal model does not explicitly include spatial distribution of 
crops,  and  is  calibrated  by  using  national  averages  for  key  indicators.  Therefore,  the  model 
cannot not  represent  the  diversity of  environmental  and  climatic  conditions  that  characterize 
Senegal’s  different  regions.  That  diversity  should  be  considered  in  order  to  refine  and  adapt 
policy interventions to local conditions. Similarly, the model does not track seasonal dynamics 
but  works  with  data  yearly  frequency,  which  might  not  highlight  within-year  variations  of 
importance for crops production. Nevertheless, our approach is consistent with the frequency of 
data available for most indicators and with the long-term orientation of the analysis. 
 
Incorporation of stakeholder perceptions, and risks of forecasting: The long-term nature of the 
projections that we analyse implies a series of limitations for the results that we produce. First, 
policy responses to the prevailing issues in rice have been articulated by diverse stakeholders, 
but  each  has  contributed  from  their  personal  knowledge,  not  through  an  elaborate 
multistakeholder process that should precede the confirmation and adoption of policies.  Second, 
all the simulation results should not be taken as precise forecasts, but rather as indications of 
trends and policy impacts obtained under a precise set of assumptions. Those projections are 
useful to learn about the general causal relations, the unintended and unexpected side-effects, 
the  impeding  and  counteracting  factors  for  improvement  to  support  the  development  of 

  118 

coherent and effective strategies for development. Third, the model is formulated at a high level 
of  aggregation  and  focuses  on  the  representation  of  the  interlinkages  between  the  different 
sectors. On the one hand that means that also in the agricultural sector, we analyse policies and 
effects  from  an  aggregated  perspective.  On  the  other  hand,  this  aggregation  and  macro 
perspective  allows  us  to  assess  the  intersectoral  effects,  dependencies  and  impacts.  In  a 
subsequent stage of the policy process these results should inform the use of sectorial models 
and  other  more detailed  planning tools.  Fourth, there  are factors  and  causalities  that  are  not 
integrated  in  the  model.    Mostly,  that  is  the  results  of  a  balancing  act,  in  which  we  aim  at 
integrating  the  main  relevant  links  without  including  too  many  factors  that  would  impede 
adopting  a  macro-perspective.  In  addition,  some  interdependencies  might  not  have  been 
included in the model due to lack of data or other kind of evidence concerning that specific causal 
relationship. Finally, our model is implemented at the national level and does not account for 
diversity at the sub-national level, which should be considered for successful implementation. 
 
Section 9: Reflections on results 
 
This complex exercise, exploring options for the future of the rice sector in Senegal has had a 
number of key outcomes:  
 
Reinforcing the value chain approach: Taking a view across rice value chains has highlighted the 
many interrelated issues that are not evident when looking only at the production side.  The size, 
distribution and ownership of rice mills, for example, can have important impacts on all sides of 
the chain:  the ability to separate and mill particular varieties of local importance and the capacity 
to recycle mill waste back into the field, for example, or the costs of transportation to markets.  
 
Stakeholder  input  to  build  contrasting  pathways: While a  complete  stakeholder  consultation 
was beyond the resources of this study, great value was found in not simply reviewing the existing 
literature but in soliciting the perspective on possible pathways for a diverse set of stakeholders.  
It was striking that amongst the stakeholders consulted, a fair convergence of opinion on viable 
future pathways emerged. 
 
Taking a systems approach to analysis: Through the intricacies of the stakeholder perspectives, 
the implications of future pathways within the rice rice sector in Senegal are manifold.  The TEEB 
AgriFood Foundations study recommends taking a system approach. In this study, it was possible 
to take a broad systems form of analysis, through building on and modifying a highly detailed, 
documented  and  verified  systems  dynamics-based  model  to  support  national  development 
planning in Senegal around the Sustainable Development Goals, structured to analyse medium-
long term development issues at the national level; and integrating the economic, social, and 
environmental aspects of development into a single framework. 

  119 

 
The  recommendations  of  stakeholders  on  how  issues  in  the  rice  sector  in  Senegal  should  be 
addressed were brought into a coherent assessment of aligned policy responses across the rice 
value chain.  The assessment presents and compares the results for the selected indicators under 
two different scenarios: the Business As Usual (BAU) assumes that current policies are continued 
into the future, while the Agroecology (AE) scenario assumes the implementation of the policy 
responses proposed by stakeholders, grouped around agroecological principles proposed by FAO 
(2018a) that we translated in nineteen policy interventions. The analysis of the simulation lead 
to ten primary findings, and nineteen policy recommendations. 
 
The results of the simulated agroecological scenarios indicate significant possible improvements 
by 2050 in all selected SDG indicators, linked to the four dimensions of capital, when compared 
by to “business as usual”. The results illustrate the interlinked nature of the system and reveal 
that the changes implemented in agriculture spread and diffuse through the whole system. While 
it can be expected that there will be improvements in produced and natural capital through a 
“greener” more sustainable system of rice cultivation, there are a number of unexpected impacts 
as  well.    For  example,  an  important  contribution  to  the  improvement  of  completion  rate  in 
secondary  school  (human  capital)  is  generated  by  the  empowerment  of  women  (supporting 
gender equality in land tenure rights, employment and education), whereas other policies are 
especially relevant for the reduction of poverty (social capital), such as the job creation through 
knowledge and labor intensive agroecological production and the formalization of the sector in 
combination with the diversification of production improving income and its distribution.  
 
Policy  options  as  per  the  outcomes  from  this  assessment:  The  assessment  points  to  many 
implications  for  policy  options  as  outlined  above  in  section  8.  Most  directly  the  assessment 
highlights  that  agroecological  interventions  are  highly  effective:  The  implementation  of  the 
proposed  policies  generate  a  significant  improvement  of  all  selected  indicators  for  the  four 
dimensions of capital.  Interestingly for policy makers, there is a strong effect of spillover and 
feeback: improvements in the AE scenario with respect to several indicators increase over time 
due to the reinforcing action of a set of positive feedback loops. This can be explained by some 
positive feedback loops that were triggered by the policies implemented in the agriculture sector, 
and subsequently continuously reinforce the original improvement. For example, the increase of 
agriculture  production  leads  to  an  increase  of  GDP  that  allows  higher  government  revenue 
enabling  higher  government  expenditure  for  more  government  services,  for  example  in 
education, health, infrastructure, increasing productivity and consequently GDP.   
 

  120 

The value of such a comprehensive, long-term analysis, and a holistic impact assessment that 
reviews the interdependencies between different dimensions of capital is highlighted, reinforcing 
the aims of the TEEB AgriFood initiative.

9: Recommendations  
 
Based on the findings of our analysis, this section presents seventeen policy recommendations 
regarding the implementation of agroecology in Senegal. Many of these recommendations are 
also relevant to other countries facing similar challenges. 
 
1)  Taking a holistic lens on prevailing issues in the rice food value chain in Senegal and asking 
the  perspective  of  a  diverse  group  of  stakeholders  brings  out  the  many  complexities  and 
interlinkages of the sector. 

2)  Despite  a  diversity  of  perspectives,  there  is  consensus  on  prevailing  issues  and  policy 
responses, which point to the compelling need for a paradigm shift in agricultural investment, 
to  agroecological  approaches  that  can  substantively  contribute  to  l  food  security  and 
nutrition while generating many positive externalities. 

4) 

3)  The  implementation  and  dissemination  of  agroecology  should  be  strengthened  and 
supported  since  the  potential  for  a  remarkable  positive  impact  on  various  dimensions  of 
capitals has been demonstrated.  More specifically, the following interventions concerning 
the implementation of agroecology can be recommended: 
It  is  necessary  to  significantly  increase  government  expenditure  for  implementing  and 
strengthening sustainable land management in a holistic way, supporting specifically small-
scale production, processing and storage. The support should be directed towards different 
activities: 
a.  A  major  part  of  this  expenditure  should  facilitate  training  and  extension  services  on 
integrated and agroecological crop management options (including for example systems 
of rice intensification) aiming at the increase of area that is sustainably managed.  

b.  The government should strengthen participatory research (for example in collaboration 
with  research  institutions  concerning  the  development  and  official  recognition  of 
knowledge provided by the agroecological farms; research on scaling up agroecology and 
barriers to do so, capitalization and popularization of results).  

c.  The  government  should  foster  the  access  to  equipment  (for  example  facilitating 
availability of small tillers for use in traditional/small-scale production which are currently 
hard to source) and access to credit (for example by supporting financial organizations to 
extend credit and micro-credit to provide preferential terms to producers or traders of 
agroecological products only, and other producers or traders otherwise contributing to 
resilience).  

d.  The  government  should  encourage  smaller  and  medium  sized  mills  and  community 
storage options (since they provide benefits, such as capacity for the use of by-products 
decreasing the waste share, reduction of transportation costs, higher prices for producers, 

  122 

lower prices for consumers, greater market efficiency and availability at the community 
markets). 

e.  Government expenditure (derived from savings with the debt relief of the AE scenario) 
should  allow  for  marketing  of  AE  products  (also  by  encouraging  the  procurement  by 
public services of agroecological product for example in hospitals, schools, armed forces, 
prisons,  etc.),  for  awareness  raising  (for  example  concerning  the  potential  of 
agroecological  practices  to  protect  the  environment),  and  for  promotional  efforts 
towards  greater  diversity  in  cultivation  and  consumption  of  crops  (for  example 
promoting diversity within crops but also within one crop). 

5)  Training  on  sustainable  land  management  should  be  combined  with  policies  to  improve 
knowledge dissemination among farmers, such as the increase of expenditure for farmers’ 
organizations, the promotion of farmer to farmer propagation or the dissemination of best 
practices. Together these interventions enlarge the area that is sustainably managed and lead 
to  the  enhancement  of  the  provision  of  ecosystem  services  (including  practices  such  as 
polycropping, intercropping, crop rotation, multi-layer farming etc. as well as the reduction 
of mineral fertilizer and pesticide use and the increase of natural fertilizer use and integrated 
pest management). While the positive impact of investment in training and knowledge might 
be realized only with a delay in time, these policies are key to improve production since they 
are more sustainable than for example subsidizing inputs. First, they generate fewer negative 
effects for environment, such as dispersion. Second, the investment in human capital builds 
up a stock of knowledge that remains – generating positive effects over decades – even when 
the investment fades out (Zuellich et al 2015). 

6)  Existing subsidies for mineral fertilizer and chemical pesticide should be shifted towards 
subsidizing the use of natural fertilizer and strengthening integrated pest management, for 
example  by  encouraging  producers  to  produce,  collect  and  market  their  own  natural 
fertilizers (e.g., azolla or green manures), by supporting the implementation of alternative 
approaches such as the use of organic fertilizer derived from the Non-Sewerage Sanitation 
System along the fecal sludge management treatment facilities, and by providing training on 
the  production  and  use  of  natural  fertilizer  as  well  as  integrated  pest  management  or 
biological pest control (see above: training on sustainable land management). This reduces 
the negative impacts on the environment (for example pesticide dispersion), and the costs of 
input while maintaining soil fertility and pest control (Settle & HamaGarba 2009;  Jepson et 
al. 2014). 

7)  Agro-livestock integration should be supported, allowing animal and crop production on the 
same land and facilitating agroecological practice, for example by providing animal dung for 
natural  fertilizer  production,  animal  strength  for  crop  production  without  increasing 
expenditure, and crop residues as animal feed. More specifically, integrated rice-fish systems 
contribute to crop diversity, farm productivity in biomass or in economics, the quality and 

  123 

8)  Saving  potentials  should  by 

increasing  efficiency 

identified  and  realized,  thus 

quantity of the food products, optimizes resource utilization through complementary use of 
scarce  land  and  water  resources,  and  realize  synergies  since  fish  provide  organic  manure 
enhancing soil fertility, and help control weeds by feeding on weed roots (Parvez et al 2016).  
in 
governmental  interventions,  for  example  concerning  irrigation  and  subsidies  for  mineral 
fertilizer  or  pesticides.  Focusing  on  efficiency  (for  example  for  water  use),  synergies  (for 
example  with  agro-livestock  integration)  and  the  reduction  of  external  input  needs  (for 
example pesticide use), the implementation of the proposed agroecological policies in this 
simulation analysis allows a decrease of government expenditure of around 0.6% of GDP each 
year (as opposed to investment in large scale schemes with high debt servicing) that leads to 
a decrease of the total debt-GDP-ratio of around 74% in 2050 in the AE scenario (where it is 
around  6%)  compared to the  BAU  scenario  (still  at  around  23%).  Hence,  the  interventions 
facilitate a repayment of debts, lowering the interest payments and even allowing an increase 
of government expenditure in the future. 

9)  Government expenditure for climate change adaptation should be significantly increased. 
The adaptation in agriculture includes the investment and implementation of practices for 
production,  inherent  to  agroecology,  such  as  locally-adapted  seed  use,  contour  farming, 
cover  cropping,  training,  moisture,  fire  and  pest  management,  but  also  the  investment  in 
research and infrastructure development in agriculture and connected areas such as water 
supply  (e.g.  reservoir  construction,  efficient  waste  water  reuse  and  treatment),  natural 
ecosystems  (e.g.  restore  watersheds  and  habitats,  conserve  crop-related  biodiversity)  and 
adaptation  to  extreme  weather  events  (for  further  details,  see  UNFCCC  2007  and  UNEP 
2014a). It has been shown that this can lead to a remarkable reduction of negative impacts 
of  climate  change  and  the  population  affected  by  natural  disasters,  but  the  results  also 
revealed the urgent need for investment in climate change adaptation in other sectors. 

10)  Reforestation interventions should be strengthened in order to prevent the depletion of 
natural capital. The analysis highlighted alarming trend of forest loss decreasing forest in only 
15 years from 1990 until 2015 by around 1 million hectares accounting for more than 12% of 
the  current  stock.  While  the  simulations  indicate  a  continuation  of  such  a  trend  if  no 
measures are taken (BAU scenario), they also reveal that it is possible to revert the decreasing 
trend and even rehabilitate the lost forest (AE scenario), but only if determined action is taken. 
Similarly,  according  to  our  simulations,  there  is  a  potential  to  impede  or  even  revert  the 
dwindling of fish resources. This emphasized the importance of the agroecological principle 
“responsible [natural resource] governance”. 

11)  Investment in  human  capital towards  empowering  people,  especially women,  should  be 
increased. One highly relevant factor of this empowerment is to foster gender equality. There, 
it is key to target the roots of inequality, specifically the gap in education by increasing female 
enrollment in all levels of education, empowering future generations of women in their self-

  124 

determination.  Womens’  education  has  been  shown  to  be  the  second  most  important 
determinant toward reducing malnutrition, after access to clean and safe water (Smith and 
Haddad 2015). Changes in enrollment of girls and women not only increase completion rates 
(an important indicator for social capital and the SDGs) but also the percentage of women in 
leadership  positions  in  the  future.  The  empowerment  of  rural  women  (for  example  by 
promoting their participation in producer groups or recognizing their legal land ownership) 
can contribute to such an increase in female enrollment assuming that in households with 
empowered women, girls are sent to school. Further, additional policies in other sectors, such 
as  education,  health  and  employment  regulations  are  necessary  to  strengthen  gender 
equality. Higher gender equality is both a goal in itself and in addition, it improves voice and 
accountability in the country contributing to a higher level of good governance (Kaufmann et 
al  2017)  with  all  the  subsequent  positive  effects  of  an  improvement  of  on  governmental 
service provision and productivity in all sectors (Kaufmann et al 2005, Kaufmann et al 1999). 
12)  Land  tenure  system  should  be  improved  by  developing  and  applying  land  management 
policies that recognize legal land ownership by women and youth, and explicitly allocate land 
for  agroecological  farming  practices, 
land  designated  for 
agroecological  practices  with  market  values.  Such  a  recognition  empowers  the  targeted 
groups, and consequently also contributes to gender equality, for example by facilitating the 
land holders’ access to credit. 

including  registration  of 

13)  The  social  components  of  agroecology  should  be  promoted,  such  as  the  reconnection  of 
food production and consumption to increase the access to agroecologically produced food 
by  urban  consumers,  especially  for  poor people,  the  job  creation by  labor  and  knowledge 
intensive agroecological production, and the support of small and medium sized production, 
processing and storage activities. These are important aspects for the improvement of food 
security and the reduction of inequalities, both relevant indicators for social capital and the 
SDGs.  

14)  Counteracting factors  should  be identified  and  eliminated if  necessary.  For  example, the 
analysis  revealed  for  example  that  the  simulated  population  growth  (doubling  population 
from  now  until  2050)  can  countervail  even  remarkable  improvements  generated  by  the 
proposed policies (or any other policies) as has been shown for cereal import dependency 
once  growth  in  population  exceeds  the  growth  in  cereal  production  (although  it  nearly 
doubles  in  the  AE  scenario  compared  to  the  BAU  scenario  in  2050).  Hence,  addressing 
population growth might be useful to ensure that growth in revenue, food production, or the 
provision of governmental services really contributes to an improvement of the well-being of 
the population. Similarly, when aiming at the absolute reduction of water withdrawal, it is 
important  to  consider  the  tradeoff  of  increasing  the  extent  of  agricultural  land  under  less 
intensive practices. The introduction and dissemination of even very efficient methods can 

  125 

lead to an increase of absolute water consumption if the increase of application area exceeds 
the savings gained through higher efficiency. 

15)  Accompanying/enabling policies in other sectors should be considered, not only concerning 
the counteracting factors (see above) but also to address negative side-effects and to further 
increase the improvement in development indicators. For example, to prevent the negative 
side-effects from positive GDP growth (caused by the agroecological interventions) further 
additional policies in other sectors might be appropriate such as further promoting material 
consumption  efficiency  and  recycling  in  other  (production)  sectors  to  ensure  sustainable 
consumption  and  production  patterns  and  to  address  the  increasing  material  footprint 
generated by the increase of GDP. In addition, of course further policies in other sectors than 
agriculture could significantly improve the analyzed indicators and dimensions of capital, for 
example interventions in areas, such as education, health, infrastructure, distribution policies 
(through  targeting  fiscal  pressure  and  subsidies  and  transfers),  renewable  energy  and 
governance.  

16)  In order to obtain significant results by 2030, policies should be immediately implemented. 
The significant delays between policy and effect, especially for some intervention areas, such 
as  education,  reforestation  and  land  or  soil  recovery  emphasize  the  importance  of  quick 
action. In addition, the inherent feedback loops reinforce positive developments over time, 
so that the improvement is higher the sooner these dynamics are activated. 

17)  Political will for the implementation of the proposed policies should be strengthened. While 
this  report  focuses  on  the  question  of  what  to  do  (analyzing  the  impact  of  proposed 
interventions)  it  does  not  address  the  question  how  to  implement  such  interventions. 
However,  of  course  it  is  key  to  identify  and  consider  enabling  and  success  factors  and 
conditions  for  the  implementation,  such  as  charismatic  leadership,  horizontal  pedagogical 
practices, favorable public policy, local and favorable markets, social organization, effective 
farming  practices,  cultural  legitimacy  (Khadse  et  al.  2018).  In  any  case,  a  comprehensive 
impact assessment should also help to create such political will and contribute to a favorable 
environment. 

18)  Consult and learn from experience when it comes to details of implementation. As it has 
been noted, this analysis focusses on the comprehensive impact assessment from a rather 
macro perspective reducing the level of details within one sector but allowing the integration 
of  several  sectors  and  dimensions  of  development.  Accordingly,  our  recommendations 
provide rather general guidelines. For concrete steps and detailed plans, sectoral planning 
tools  and  experts,  but  also  experiences  and  showcases  from  other  countries  and  regions 
should be consulted44. In any case, it is of course key to take into account the country- and 
region-specific contexts and circumstances to identify concrete steps. 

44 Various showcases have been documented and analysed, see for example www.fao.org/agroecology/knowledge/practices/en/ or 
www.agroecology-pool.org/showcases/

19)  Promote the use of comprehensive long-term analysis that reveals interactions, spill-over 
effects, reinforcing or counteracting feedback loops and impeding factors as well as delays. 
Conceivably, such an analysis could be an ongoing monitoring and evaluation exercise based 
on the TEEB AgriFood Framework. Thisanalysis would highlight the interconnected nature of 
the system; assessments that neglect those interdependencies will not be able to provide the 
same insights and are very likely to underestimate some aspects of impact (for example by 
overlooking  spill-overs,  reinforcing  feedback  loops  or  synergies)  or  overestimating  other 
aspects  (ignoring  counteracting  effects  or  tendencies).  Using  a  system  model  as  a  tool  of 
analysis  facilitates  such  a  comprehensive  impact  assessment  by  taking  into  account  the 
general interdependencies and aspects of complexity (delay, non-linearity, feedback) and at 
the same time being adaptable to country specific contexts and circumstances. 

 
Overall observations 
 
“The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity” initiative of the UN Environment asks us to look 
at the many invisible flows between capital stocks, and to promote the use of comprehensive 
long term analysis that reveals interactions, spillover effects, and reinforcing or counteracting 
feedback loops. This analysis highlights the interconnected nature of the system; assessments 
that  neglect  those  interdependencies  will  not  provide  the  same  insights.  A  key  one  here, 
unexpectedly, was how much a reorientation of the rice sector to respect forms of capital can 
richochet through the national economy, even given the relatively small size of rice production 
in Senegalese agriculture. 
 
The long-term nature of the projections that we analyse implies a series of limitations for the 
results  that  we  produce.  First,  policy  responses  to  the  prevailing  issues  in  rice  have  been 
articulated by diverse stakeholders, but each has contributed from their personal knowledge, not 
through  an  elaborate  multistakeholder  process  that  should  precede  the  confirmation  and 
adoption of policies.  Second, all the simulation results should not be taken as precise forecasts, 
but rather as indications of trends and policy impacts obtained under a precise set of assumptions. 
Those  projections  are  useful  to  learn  about  the  general  causal  relations,  the  unintended  and 
unexpected side-effects, the impeding and counteracting factors for improvement to support the 
development  of  coherent  and  effective  strategies  for  development.  Third,  the  model  is 
formulated at a high level of aggregation and focuses on the representation of the interlinkages 
between the different sectors. On the one hand that means that also in the agricultural sector, 
we  analyse  policies  and  effects  from  an  aggregated  perspective.  On  the  other  hand,  this 
aggregation and macro perspective allows us to assess the intersectoral effects, dependencies 
and impacts. In a subsequent stage of the policy process these results should inform the use of 
sectorial models and other more detailed planning tools. Fourth, there are factors and causalities 

  127 

that are not integrated in the model.  These are the results of a balancing act, in which we aim at 
integrating  the  main  relevant  links  without  including  too  many  factors  that  would  impede 
adopting  a  macro-perspective.  In  addition,  some  interdependencies  might  not  have  been 
included in the model due to lack of data or other kind of evidence concerning that specific causal 
relationship. Finally, our model is implemented at the national level and does not account for 
diversity at the sub-national level, which should be considered for successful implementation.

Annex 1 

Explanation of policy variables and assumptions used in Table 4: 

Expenditure for agriculture water efficiency and irrigation equipment (% of GDP): 

-  Decrease of expenditure for (inefficient) irrigation equipment frees money for other purposes 
- 

Increase of expenditure for efficient irrigation equipment 
Natural fertilizer use per ha harvested area (ton/ha/year) 
Increase of natural fertilizer use (since in the AE scenario the production and use is trained) 
Expenditure for fertilizer subsidies (% of GDP) 

- 

-  Decrease of subsidies for mineral fertilizer decreases the use of mineral fertilizer 

- 

Average biological pest control use per ha harvested area 
Increase of biological pest control (since in the AE scenario the use is trained) 
Pesticide use per ha harvested area (kg/ha/year) 

-  Decrease of pesticide use (assuming that it is replaced by biological pest control) 

- 
- 

- 
- 

- 

Share of arable land used for agro-livestock 
Assumption that 33% of arable land is converted to agro-livestock land 
assuming that the productivity on agro-livestock land is 90% compared to arable land (on the former arable 
land that is now agro-livestock land they produce 90% of what has been produced on the land when used as 
arable land only  PLUS 17% of what is produced on land when it is used as pasture land only) 
Share of pasture land used for agro-livestock 
Assumption that 7% of pasture is converted to agro-livestock land  
Assuming that the productivity on agro-livestock land is 17% compared to pasture land 
Base salary for farmers45 
It  is  assumed  that  farmers  (supported  by  the  government  through  expenditure  for  sustainable  land 
management, farmers organization) diversify their production and consequently can increase their income 
Expenditure for climate change adaptation in agriculture (% of GDP) 
It is assumed that the government invest intensively in climate change adaptation in agriculture.  

- 
-  We use investments in adaptation for agriculture in a rather broad sense that include covering of adaptation 
cost for agriculture, water supply and natural ecosystems (UNFCCC 2007), respectively agriculture, extreme 
weather events and water supply / flood protection (UNEP 2014a). Based on the mentioned adaptation cost 
literature these adaptation investment needs sum up to around 33-42% of total adaptation investment needs. 
These investments are able to reduce the negative effects of climate change on agriculture to a minimum and 
reduce the proportion of population affected by natural disasters 
Expenditure for sustainable land management (% of GDP) 

45 The % indicates the minimum salary relative to average salary. 

 

- 

- 

- 

- 

The  focus  of  the  expenditure  for  SLM  is  the  training  of  farmers,  and  consequently  increases  the  area  of 
harvested  area  sustainably  managed.  This  includes  the  application  (and  production)  of  natural  fertilizer, 
biological  pest  control,  techniques  of  SLM  (such  as  polycropping,  intercropping,  crop  rotation,  multi-layer 
farming etc.). 
This increases employment in agriculture (since SLM is more labor intensive), and soil nutrient balance (more 
natural  fertilizer),  and  decreases  agriculture  land  decrease  (less  land  degradation  and  abandonment)  and 
dispersion (less use of mineral fertilizer)  
Average knowledge dissemination about sustainable agriculture by organized farmers (person/farmer/year) 
It is assumed that farmers (also pushed by ‘movements’ such as in ZBNF) and supported by organizations (that 
are  supported  by  government  (see  below)  increase  their  knowledge  sharing  in  forms  of  farmer  to  farmer 
propagation, dissemination of best practices etc. 
Concrete assumption: one farmer trains 0.4 other farmers per year (or in other words: one farmer trains one 
other farmer every 2.5 year) 
Waste share reduction due to small scale mills 

-  Due to the support of small scale farmers and mills (see for example farmers organization and SLM) the waste 
share is reduced (increasing the food available for the population and the agriculture production value per 
ton 
Processing share increase due to small scale mills 

- 

-  Due  to  the  support  of  small  scale  farmers  and  mills  (see  for  example  farmers  organization  and  SLM)  the 
processing share is increased (increasing the processed food available for the population and the agriculture 
production value per ton) 
Expenditure for farmers organization (% of GDP) 
Expenditure for farmers organization strengthens the exchange between the farmer (for example facilitates 
the training of farmers by farmers (see above), facilitates initiatives concerning small scale storage, processing 
etc.  
Expenditure for additional reforestation (% of GDP) 
The  investment  in  reforestation  increases  forest  land  by  reforesting  other  land  (not  land  that  is  used  for 
agriculture) 
Proportion of population below food poverty line with access to non-marketed food 

- 

-  Due to the support of small scale farmers (through training in SLM, support of farmers organization) and due 
to the fact that employment in agriculture increases (due to the increase in labor-intensive agriculture) more 
people have access to non-marketed food, decreasing undernourishment and malnutrition in the population. 
Proportion of adult population with partial employment 

-  Due to the job creation through knowledge and labor intensive agroecological production the population that 

has a partial employment increases

It is assumed that the support of government is especially directed towards small-scale farmers (e.g. training 
in SLM, support of farmers organization) and women increasing their participation and rights  
Report of the gender gap in employment in relation to gender gap in education46 
It is assumed that the support of government is especially directed towards small-scale farmers (e.g. training 
in SLM, support of farmers organization) and women decreasing the gender gap (for example participation) 
in relation to the education gender gap 
Education gender bias (secondary, tertiary) 
It  is  assumed  that the  empowered  women  in  agriculture  send  more  of  their  girls  to  school  increasing  the 
female enrolment in secondary and tertiary 
Voice and Accountability (scale -2.5 to 2.5) 
It is assumed that the support  and empowerment  of farmers (especially  through the training and farmers 
organization) increases the possibilities and the ability to participate in the civil society, controlling and holding 
government  accountable (in  other words increasing the dimension of good governance (as defined by the 
indicator of the World Bank): voice and accountability)
