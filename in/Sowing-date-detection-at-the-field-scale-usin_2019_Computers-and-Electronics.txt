Sowing dates have a great influence on crop yields as they affect what environmental conditions the plants will
experience. Therefore, sowing dates are important to many individuals and organizations on the food production
chain, including food manufacturers and traders. Despite their importance, large-scale comprehensive data on
sowing dates are currently rare and often available only as broad estimates at the state, county or district level.
Continuously obtaining sowing dates at the field scale is expensive, time-consuming and prone to human errors.
Remote sensing on the other hand has the potential of conducting rapid, cost-effective and continuous surveys of
farm management practices over large scales. Over the last decade, a new era in Earth observation satellites
began with the production and deployment of smaller, lighter and cheaper nano-satellites known as CubeSats.
Images from these satellites can potentially be used to capture sowing dates over time. In this study, we de-
veloped an innovative semi-automated sowing date detection methodology, which uses high spatio-temporal
resolution CubeSat images to detect sowing dates at the field scale. We identified the sowing dates by using
Planet’s PlanetScope data to detect changes on the fields’ surface caused by no-tillage sowing. Our approach
overcame the signal inconsistences existing among the numerous sensors in the constellation, and detected
85% of the sown fields with = 0.99. We succeeded to identify the actual sowing dates of individual fields with
a median gap of 0 days within an unparalleled RMSE of 0.9 and 1.9 days in a set of national trials and in fields of
a commercial farm, respectively. The methodology presented in this study can be used to produce and update
field level crop statistics on a near daily-basis at a low cost. It is robust and simple and can be applied over a wide
range of soil types, atmospheric conditions, crop types and sensors, to detect sowing dates in regions where no-
tillage sowing is practiced.

1. Introduction

Sowing dates have a large impact on crop development and growth
and ultimately crop yields as they affect what environmental conditions
the plants will experience (Coventry et al., 1993; Flohr et al., 2017).
Sowing dates are thus important to organizations and individuals who
are interested in production, processing, marketing and trade of food
and its products (Guo, 2013). Sowing dates are one of the factors under
the farmers’ control to influence the crop environment and thus the
yield (Ortiz-Monasterio and Lobell, 2007), as earlier or later sowing
frequently decreases crop survival and grain yields (Ozturk et al., 2006;
Flohr et al., 2017). For instance, sowing too early increases the risk of
frost in crops like wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in post-heading frost
prone regions, such as Australia (Zheng et al., 2012; Flohr et al., 2017).
On the other hand, late sowing can result in a reduced growing season
due to greater temperature (Duchemin et al., 2015) and greater risk of
drought and heat stresses (e.g. Zheng et al., 2012; Chenu et al., 2013).

Studies showed that the difference between ‘best’ the and ‘worst’
sowing dates could affect wheat yields by more than 1 t/ha (Ortiz-
Monasterio and Lobell, 2007) and even cause a crop failure, with a
reduction of up to 100% of the yield (Zheng et al., 2015). Knowing the
actual time when farmers sowed their crop could be used to better
understand and improve current sowing practices and potentially in-
crease yields (Ortiz-Monasterio and Lobell, 2007). For instance, an
analysis of sowing date records indicated that wheat farmers from the
major cropping parts of Australia have shifted their sowing dates by
around 1.5 days per annum over the last decade, and could still sow
earlier to increase their yield (Flohr et al., 2018). Given the significance
of sowing dates for crop production, detecting sowing dates would be
valuable for different crops from a local to global scale (Manfron et al.,
2017; Urban et al., 2018).
Sowing dates are major inputs for crops models, which are com-
monly used to explore the expected yield effects of different manage-
ment practices (including sowing dates across a range of locations

Traditionally,

(Zheng et al., 2012; Holzworth et al., 2014; Chenu et al., 2017; Flohr
et al., 2017)). However, sowing dates are a source of considerable un-
certainty for regional studies (Mathison et al., 2017). Accurate regional
information about sowing dates at a farm scale can be used to reduce
the uncertainty of crop simulations (Mathison et al., 2017), however,
obtaining accurate sowing dates from ground reports is very difficult
and time consuming (Sacks et al., 2010; Marinho et al., 2014).
information associated with crop phenology (in-
cluding sowing dates) is collected in farmers’ surveys and is used to
produce cropping systems or agro-ecological zoning maps that can be
found as a form of national census. Even though sowing dates at a field
scale are very important agronomically, only a few census datasets
contain this information or are made publicly available (in both de-
veloped and developing countries) (Urban et al., 2018). Furthermore,
most of these data when they exist, are often infrequent, not quanti-
tative, and available at the national scale or at the sub-national scale
such as the state, county or district level (Sacks et al., 2010; Guo, 2013).
Producing statistics at the field level may improve our understanding of
the reasons of yield gaps (i.e. gaps between achieved and achievable
yields) (Hochman et al., 2012). Moreover, such a database could assist
to identify fields with low-performing management where greater
productivity could easily be achieved by adapting the sowing date (Jain
et al., 2016). To overcome this issue, many studies have used satellite
remote sensing to map sowing dates over large areas using different
spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g. Lobell et al., 2003; Sakamoto
et al., 2005; Ortiz-Monasterio and Lobell, 2007; Lobell et al., 2013;
Marinho et al., 2014; Jain et al., 2016; Manfron et al., 2017; Urban
et al., 2018).
The advantages of remote sensing over the traditional approaches to
collecting data on crop management practices have long been

recognised (Ortiz-Monasterio and Lobell, 2007). However, a metho-
dology for detecting sowing dates directly from remote sensing imagery
has not yet been developed. That is mainly because there is a lag-time
between the sowing date and the plant emergence. Jin et al. (2016)
argued that it is impossible to detect the sowing dates directly. Most
existing studies attempted first to detect the crop “green-up”, i.e. the
earliest reliable evidence of vegetation that can be sensed on satellite
images (Lobell et al., 2013; Manfron et al., 2017), and then to backcast
emergence and sowing dates by assuming the lag time between the
sowing and the green-up detection to be constant (e.g. Lobell et al.,
2013; Marinho et al., 2014; Duchemin et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2016; Gao
et al., 2017; Manfron et al., 2017). In India, Lobell et al. (2013) used
time series of MODIS and SPOT satellite Vegetation Index (VI) products,
both with a spatial resolution of 1 km, to estimate the green-up date
each year at a district level. This allowed them to infer sowing dates
within two-day difference from reported dates at the district level. In
China, Jin et al. (2016) estimated wheat sowing dates using Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series derived from the Chi-
nese satellite HJ-1A/B (with a spatial resolution of 30 m and 2 days
revisit time). They estimated sowing dates based on the relationship
between the green-up and the sowing dates following the method from
Lobell et al. (2013), and found sowing-dates estimates differing by an
average of 6 days from the ground-based estimates. In the U.S.A, Urban
et al. (2018) compared three satellite-based sowing estimation methods
applied for maize and soybean at a county-level by using three different
sensors that cover a large range of the electromagnetic spectrum. They
used MODIS (optical) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), solar-induced
fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 (fluorescence) and Ku-band back-
scattering (dB) from QuikSCAT (radar) to detect the initial green-up
stage. In their case, both EVI and SIF based estimations of sowing dates

reached
of 0.75 and RMSE < 10 days from their county-level vali-
dation data, whereas the radar-based estimates were negatively corre-
lated with observed dates for most counties. Although the green-up
detection approach gained popularity in the last two decades, using a
fixed lag-time limits this method to the regions where this constant is
known or can be determined. Furthermore, this approach neglects the
strong impact of the weather variability, such as the timing of rainfall,
on crop emergence dates (Marais Sicre et al., 2016). Another method
estimated the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation
(fAPAR) to estimate the sowing date. But using this method, Lobell
et al. (2003) only managed to predict planting months at a high con-
fidence (up to 50% of the mean). Ortiz-Monasterio and Lobell (2007)
used estimated fAPAR together with measured daily temperature and
radiation as inputs in a crop growth model to estimate sowing dates.
They achieved a high level of agreement ( = 0.85, RMSE = 6.5 days)
between their estimated and reported sowing dates. In Japan, Sakamoto
et al. (2005) detected paddy fields which were ploughed and flooded
before the rice planting, by identification of the decreased VI values
during this period, using time series of MODIS-based EVI. They
achieved an RMSE of 12.1 days between their sowing-date estimations
and official regional statistics.
Remote sensing has also been applied to monitor other agricultural
operations such as tillage (ploughing and harrowing), irrigation and
harvesting (Mc Nairn et al., 1998; Sakamoto et al., 2005; Hadria et al.,
2009; Pacheco et al., 2010; Guo, 2013). In terms of sowing, sowing
crops into untilled soil (also called ‘no-tillage’, ‘zero tillage’ farming or
‘conservation agriculture’ (Derpsch et al., 2010)) has increasingly been
adopted around the world over the last decades (Hobbs et al., 2008).
This technique presents a lot of advantages such as fuel, time and la-
bour conservation, soil improvement (e.g. increase in soil nitrogen,
organic matter, and water infiltration; decrease in soil erosion), lower
costs and potential for yield increase (Baker and Saxton, 2006; Pacheco
et al., 2010). Due to these benefits (Zheng et al., 2014), the cropland
area under conservation tillage increased worldwide by 47% in four
years only, i.e. from 106.5 million ha in 2009 to 157 million ha in 2013
(Kassam et al., 2015).
With the no-tillage farming practice, seeds are directly sown into the
previous crop residue and stubble. Therefore, we can assume that
sowing represents the first change on the surface at the field-scale since
the last harvest. From a remote sensing perspective, this means a dis-
tinct contrast between the sown (‘disturbed’) and un-sown (untilled)
soil. Theoretically, this change can be used to detect sowing dates at the
field scale using time-series of satellite images. Remotely-sensed tillage-
mapping approaches already exist. They are based on the assessment of
two features that are strongly modified by tillage systems: residue cover
and surface roughness. Previous studies used optical, multi or hyper-
spectral sensors for qualitative and quantitative estimations of residue
cover (Bégué et al., 2018). Daughtry (2001) showed that crop residues
and soils often have similar spectral signature. However, crop residue
has a unique absorption of electromagnetic radiation near 2100 nm,
which is associated with cellulose and lignin. The understanding of this
absorption feature lays the foundation for a number of tillage indices
derived from optical remote sensing with shortwave infrared (SWIR)
bands (1200–2500 nm), such as ASTER, Landsat and MODIS (Serbin
et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2014).
To accurately detect sowing dates at a field scale from space using a
no-tillage detection approach, a new high spatial and temporal re-
solution remote sensing source is needed. While satellites such as
Sentinel-2 and Landsat may have adequate spatial resolution for dif-
ferent applications in agriculture (e.g. Battude et al., 2016; Skakun
et al., 2017; Bégué et al., 2018), their temporal resolution (5 and
16 days revisit time, respectively) is not ideal for sowing detection, as
there may be weeks between the acquisition of two clear-sky images
(McCabe et al., 2017). To overcome these spatio-temporal limitations
constellations of micro or nano-satellites known as CubeSats can be
used (McCabe et al., 2017).

PlanetScope images (vertical grey lines). The crop type and number of fields sown each date for both NVT and Birchip farm.

Over the last decade, the number of companies developing CubeSat
satellites has increased. These new satellites, such as Planet Labs
(“Planet”) PlanetScope and Skybox imaging SkySat satellites, are rela-
tively inexpensive to build and allow mass production which enables
the creation of a collection of both high spatial (< 5 m) and temporal
resolution (< 1 week) imagery at lower cost (Dash and Ogutu, 2016;
Jain et al., 2016). These satellites have the potential to monitor and
detect rapidly changing environments on the Earth surface (McCabe
et al., 2017) and to obtain multiple measures of the same field, in-
cluding sowing and harvesting dates throughout a single growing
season, as demonstrated by Jain et al. (2016) in India. These authors
established and calibrated linear relationships between sowing date
(and yield) and the Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI) derived
from SkySat images, which allowed them to estimate sowing dates (and
wheat yields) with an
of 0.41–0.62 and an RMSE of 6.68–12.41 days.
However, a downside of CubeSat constellations is the frequent incon-
sistency in data collected by different satellites in the constellation
(Houborg and McCabe, 2016). Such inconsistencies may limit the ac-
curacy of surface reflectance-based applications such as estimation of
vegetation indices, and could hinder the use of CubeSat satellites to
monitor changes on the Earth surface.
In this paper, we propose a new and robust method to use CubeSat
satellites, which operate in the optical range of the electromagnetic
spectrum, to estimate sowing dates at the field scale via detection of no-
tillage operation. The methodology used Planet’s PlanetScope satellite
images to detect sowing dates of (i) small experimental wheat fields
sown across Australia in a wide range of soils and weather conditions,
and (ii) in all fields of a typical commercial farm in Victoria.

2. Methodology

Sowing dates were detected at a field scale through unsupervised
change detection using Planet’s CubeSat data. Our approach is based on
the widely-used no-tillage farming practices. When a farmer sows, the
surface changes its color or spectral response, usually to a darker color
depending on the soil type. These changes are mainly caused by the

newly exposed soil, which was just uplifted to the surface and by the
mixing of last season’s crop residues with the soil. After discussion with
experts, we assumed that when no-tillage farming practices are im-
plemented, the first detectable field-scale change in the surface after the
harvest is the sowing. Based on this, we developed a robust simple
change detection method to detect sowing dates, which can be applied
over a wide range of soil types, atmospheric conditions and sensors,
regardless of crop types.

2.1. Study fields and regions

Our approach to directly detecting sowing dates using high spatio-
temporal resolution CubeSat data was first tested using the Australian
National Variety Trials (NVT) testing fields. The NVT is an Australian
national program (www.nvtonline.com.au). In order to evaluate the
capability of the new approach to detect sowing dates in different
conditions, 16 NVT fields located at eight sites were chosen across
Australia from the 2017 growing season (Fig. 1). The studied field trials
were selected to be located in the different main Australian wheat
growing regions, and have diverse management practices, soil types,
and weather conditions (Table 1). The average size of the NVT fields
analysed in this study was 0.27 ha (about 70 m × 40 m).
In the second stage, the methodology was tested for 50 fields of a
commercial farm located near Birchip, Victoria (Fig. 1, Table 1) in
2017. The farm corresponds to an average Victorian farm. It is 6400 ha
in size (the average field size is 116 ha), and grows a large variety of
crops including wheat, barley (Hordeum vulgare), canola (Brassica
napus), lentils (Lens culinaris), oats (Avena spp.), vetch (Vicia sativa) and
peas (Pisum sativum) across 55 fields. The studied sowing period in this
farm spanned from late-March to mid-June (Fig. 2).

satellites (Planet Team, 2018). A complete PlanetScope constellation
consists of about 120 satellites, which have the capability to image all
of the Earth’s land surface on a daily basis. The PlanetScope satellites
have four spectral bands Blue (455–515 nm), Green (500–590 nm), Red
(590–670 nm) and NIR (780–860 nm) with a Ground Sampling Distance
(GSD) of 3–4 m at the nadir and positional accuracy of < 10 m RMSE
(Planet Team, 2018). Planet’s PlanetScope constellation operates in two
different orbits, the International Space Station (ISS) orbit and in a Sun
Synchronous Orbit (SSO). The PlanetScope satellites, which operate at
ISS, are deployed at an orbit altitude of 400 km (51.6° inclination), have
a variable equatorial crossing time and a limited lifetime of about
1 year. Those on the SSO are deployed at orbit altitude of 475 km (∼98°
inclination), with an equator crossing time of 9:30–11:30 am (at local
time) and expected 2–3 years lifetime (Houborg and McCabe, 2018;
Planet Team, 2018). The PlanetScope analytic Ortho Scene Products
(Level 3B) are used in this study, which were provided at a spatial re-
solution of ∼ 3 m and with sensor-specific conversions to at-sensor top
of Atmosphere radiance based on limited pre-launch calibration coef-
ficients (Houborg and McCabe, 2018; Planet Team, 2018).
This study used a total of 205 (78 for the NVT analysis and 127 for
the farm analysis) Planet CubeSat satellites scenes acquired by 78 dif-
ferent satellites (61 for the NVT analysis and 30 for the farm analysis).
For each NVT location, we used Planet CubeSat images, which covered
a period of ten days before and ten days after the reported sowing dates
(depending on image availability) (Table 2). On average, each field was
covered by 9.5 satellite images throughout the testing period, with an
average of two days gap between the images. For the farm analysis,
images from 17/04/2017 to 20/06/2017 were used (Fig. 2), with a five
day median gap between cloud-free CubeSat images (Table 2). The
2017 growing season was chosen since in the previous seasons, the
PlanetScope constellation was not yet complete and the revisit time of
each location was insufficient to accurately detect sowing dates.

2.3. Semi-automated sowing detection

and

The semi-automated method developed to detect sowing dates
based on spectral changes between successive CubeSat images of a field
(Fig. 3) requires three inputs: (1) two satellite images acquired on dif-
ferent dates (
); (2) the field boundaries; and (3) a
threshold value to detect changes between images, which has to be
manually input for each set of images. This threshold corresponds to the
percentage of values in the processed image histogram that will be used
as a factor to determine a change in the image. First, the images from
the same day (which may not necessarily be acquired by the same sa-
tellite) were mosaicked. Since PlanetScope satellites tend to have cross-
sensor inconsistency (Houborg and McCabe, 2016), the pixel values in
the mosaicked image commonly suffer from the lack of uniformity.
Next, each mosaicked image is clipped using the fields’ boundaries; in
the following step, we used image-processing techniques to detect the
sowing dates.

2.4. Change detection

Many change-detection methods have been developed to identify
changes on the earth’s surface using remote sensing (e.g. Mas, 1999;
Bruzzone and Prieto, 2000; Lu et al., 2004; Jin et al., 2013). Change
detection using remote sensing images basically involves the compar-
ison of two images of the same area, which were acquired at different
times (Byrne et al., 1980).
In this study, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed
separately for each image to detect the change in the fields’ surface
caused by no-tillage sowing (Fig. 3). PCA is useful for detecting dec-
orrelations between images (Du and Fowler, 2007) and also for separ-
ating an underlying systematic data structure from noise (Wold et al.,
1987). Four principal components (
) were output
from all the pixels of the mosaic that intersected with the fields’ poly-
gons. In this study,

tended to represent variations in the vegetation and

represented better the variance in the soils, while

new sowing occurred between these two dates by using the following
equation:

(1)
where
is the first principal component of the earlier satellite
image and
is the first principal component of the later satellite
image. The ratio of the two resulted in a one-band raster that represents
the magnitude of change between the two images at the pixel level
(Fig. 5B). A pixel value closer to 1 indicates no change. The histogram
of the ratio image generally exhibits a normal distribution (bell-shaped)
around the value of 1 if there is no change across the image. When
changes occur, the histogram would show a multimodal distribution,
with several distributions combined, i.e. would have multiple peaks and
valleys. By examining the distributions rather than the one representing
“no change”, we determine a threshold pixel (ratio) value to identify
changes. For example, in Fig. 5C, there are two distributions of the pixel
values: one is a normal distribution around 1 and the other is a normal
distribution around about 2.8. The second distribution represents the
changes. The left end of the second distribution is set as the threshold
value. A pixel with a value equal to or greater than this threshold is
considered as “change”. The threshold values may change from scene to
scene due to cross-sensor inconsistencies among the different satellites
in the constellation. In our case study, threshold values range between
1.2 and 3.
The classified image at this stage (Fig. 6D) contains a lot of noise,
which was eliminated in two stages. First, a low-pass filtering method is
used (Fig. 6E) to smooth and remove speckle noise from the image (Al-
Amri et al., 2010). Second, only if the area detected as changed covers
more than 25% of the field area, is considered sown. This second noise
cleaning stage is used to filter other changes detected on the earth
surface that could have changed over time, e.g. manmade (e.g. infra-
structure construction) or caused by a natural phenomenon (e.g. water

and

ponding on the surface). Note that sowing large fields (e.g. more than
250 ha) may take a few days, and it is common for farmers to not sow
an entire field in a day. In such case, we assigned the latest date in
which more than 25% of the field’s area detected as sown, as the final
sowing date for that field. Since we identified which fields were sown
, we know that the sowing date must be
between
within this timeframe. Therefore, we assigned the middle date between
the earlier and later images as the final sowing date to each field. The
final output of the semi-automated sowing detection technique is a
shapefile that contains fields or parts of fields detected as sown (as
shown in Fig. 6), the estimated sowing date, the actual sown area and
the percentage within each field that was sown in the time period be-
tween

and

.

3. Results

A very high correlation ( = 0.99) was found between reported
and detected sowing dates in both 16 NVT fields and the Birchip farm
analysis (Fig. 7), which span over a wide range of soil types, atmo-
spheric conditions, crop types and PlanetScope sensors (Table 1, Fig. 2).
The proposed semi-automated methodology detected 100% of the
sowings in NVT fields and 80% in the farm fields (Table 3). There was
only an average −0.6 day gap (0.0 day gap for the median) between the
estimated and the actual sowing dates (RMSE = 0.9 days). For the
Birchip farm, the average and median gaps were −0.1 and 0.0, re-
spectively (RMSE = 1.9 days) for the fields detected as sown (Table 3).
During the analysis, a few false detections were found (in only 5% of
the algorithm implementations), where a field was incorrectly classified
as sown by the sowing detection algorithm in the time period between
. Most of the sowing detection analyses (95%) ended
with zero false detections, however in some cases the presence of clouds
in the images was translated as a change that covers most of the field
and therefore was determined as sown. In the NVT analysis, only 1.4%
of the detections were false detections. False detection occurred more

often in the Birchip farm, when 9.1% of the detections were false de-
tections. This higher rate of false detection was mainly due to cloud
contamination in the 23/04/17 image, which caused five false detec-
tions. When excluding this image from the analysis, only 6.1% of the
detections were false detections.
Detection failures, i.e. no detection of sowing, which occurred in
20% of the farm’s fields, were partly due to cloud cover (50% of the
cases) and the large time gap between
(33% of the
cases). Most successful detections took place when the gap between the
sowing and the satellite image date was under four days (Fig. 8). In
these conditions, the successful detection rate was 91% of the fields,
however, when this gap is larger than five days the percentage of the
successful detections drops to 62% (Fig. 8).
Although the distribution of the number of samples in Fig. 8 is not
constant along the X-axis, and the probability data points are scattered,
the log probability curve shows a clear decreasing trend. The reason for
a lower probability to achieve a successful detection when the gap in
days from the sowing dates to the satellite cover is larger is due to the
fading in contrast between the appearance of the unsown and the sown
soil surfaces. These were caused mainly by the rainfall events, wind
erosion and the loss of the moisture in the newly exposed soil, which
makes this contrast fade with time.
Although our semi-automatic sowing detection method was de-
signed to determine the sowing date when a field was sown in more
than 25% of its area, it has the capacity to identify sub-field changes.
For instance, sowing of a small proportion of the field was detected at
the Birchip farm (Fig. 9), as the grower did not have time to complete

the sowing of the entire field at once, which is relatively common in this
region.

4. Discussion
4.1. Detecting no-tillage sowing with CubeSat satellites

Remote sensing has the potential for mapping sowing dates across
the globe. To our knowledge, no methodology has been published on
how to detect sowing dates directly from satellite images. While, until
recently, such detection could not happen due to technological limita-
tions (low spatial resolution and revisit time of the satellites), our ap-
proach overcomes these limitations by using CubeSat images to detect
no-tillage sowing, which is becoming the main sowing practice in major
cropping regions worldwide (Kassam et al., 2015). When a farmer uses
a no-tillage seeder without performing any pre-sowing cultivation, the
surface changes its color, usually to a darker color. These changes can
sometimes appear as minor and they cannot always be seen with a
naked eye (e.g. Fig. 5A), given the similarity of the spectral signature of
crop residues and soils in the visible and near infrared. Their spectra
differ within the SWIR spectrum (Daughtry, 2001), but CubeSat sa-
tellites like Planet’s PlanetScope, which are attractive given their high
spatio-temporal coverage, commonly do not operate in such long wa-
velengths. Hence, they cannot be used to detect the changes caused by
no-tillage practices using SWIR-based tillage indices.
Satellite-based change detection is commonly based on the analysis
of differences between two images using band-ratios or classifications

derived from the original image bands. However, such approaches are
very limited for CubeSats such as PlanetScope given (i) cross-sensor
inconsistencies, as the PlanetScope satellites are not identical, so that
each CubeSat can have a unique spectral response (McCabe et al.,
2017), and (ii) different atmospheric conditions during the acquisition.

Different atmospheric conditions affect the amount of radiation that
reaches the sensor, causing inter-band and inter-pixel differences within
the two images (Byrne et al., 1980). Unlike sensors such as Landsat,
MODIS or Sentinel-2, which traditionally developed and launched by
space agencies, Planet’s CubeSats suffer from relatively low signal-to-

noise ratio. As a result, any time-series data from those CubeSat sa-
tellites is likely to have inconsistent reflectance signals, even when
applying atmospheric correction techniques (Houborg and McCabe,
2018). The main challenge when conducting change detection using
these types of satellites is to separate the noise captured by the sensors,
which causing dissimilarities among the different satellites in the con-
stellation, from the actual change that happened on the Earth surface
between the earlier and later images. Therefore, the reliability of de-
tecting changes, while analysing images acquired by different CubeSat
images such as PlanetScope constellation, is very limited when using
the original bands (Houborg and McCabe, 2016) and indices. That adds
the challenges of addressing the varying atmospheric conditions to the
change detection analysis. To overcome these limitations we im-
plemented the PCA, which is a well-known statistical technique for
multivariate data analysis (Wold et al., 1987; Pohl and Van Genderen,
1998; Du and Fowler, 2007). PCA extracts the dominant patterns in the
dataset (Wold et al., 1987) and expresses this information as a set of
new variables called Principal Components (Abdi and Williams, 2010).
The first Principal Component (PC) band in the image contains the
largest fraction of data variance and the second PC band contains the
second largest data variance, and so forth. The last
bands seem noisy
due to the very little variance they contain, which manly represent the
noise in the original spectral data (Rajendran et al., 2016). PCA is useful
for detecting decorrelations between images (Du and Fowler, 2007) and
also for separating an underlying systematic data structure from noise

Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 157 (2019) 568–580

(Wold et al., 1987). In remote sensing PCA is commonly used for land-
cover/land-use change detection, classification and anomaly detection
(e.g. Byrne et al., 1980; Du and Fowler, 2007; Celik, 2009; Abdi and
Williams, 2010; Dronova et al., 2015; Gil-Yepes et al., 2016). Further-
more, PCA-based change-detection is effective regardless of the differ-
ences in spectral, spatial, and radiometric resolutions of the multi-
sensor satellite data (Deng et al., 2008). In this study, we used a PCA to
extract the dominant patterns in the images, and to conduct detection of
changes between the main patterns in each pair of images. This method
allowed us to have a comparable measure between the images to detect
changes in the fields’ surface, even when we used images acquired by
78 different PlanetScope satellites with different atmospheric condi-

tions. We have found that using
other
to detect changes caused by sowing, even when processing
images acquired by CubeSats with a limited pre-launch sensor-specific
calibration (Houborg and McCabe, 2018; Planet Team, 2018).

4.2. Unprecedented levels of sowing detection

Our semi-automated sowing detection methodology achieved high
performances with 85% detection (56 out of 66) of the sown fields in
both NVT and Birchip farm fields (Table 3). The estimated sowing dates
were very highly correlated with the actual sowing dates ( = 0.99;
Fig. 7), with a median gap of 0 days between the reported and estimated
dates, and a low RMSE (0.9 and 1.9 days for the NVT fields and the
Birchip farm, respectively; Table 3). The results of our semi-automated
sowing detection methodology, thus exceeds the performance and ac-
curacy of the methods used by previous studies, which used different
spaceborne sensors with diverse resolutions and in various electro-
magnetic spectral regions (optical, fluorescence, and radar). Studies
that used the green-up detection approach, succeeded in estimating
sowing dates with a RMSE ranging from 6.68 to 12.41 days, and
ranging between 0.15 and 0.90 between their estimations and official
regional statistics (e.g. Lobell et al., 2013; Jain et al., 2016; Urban et al.,
2018). Their main limitation is to use a fixed period (days to weeks) to
backcast the emergence of the crops, while this period varies in parti-
cular with crops species and weather conditions (Marais Sicre et al.,
2016; Urban et al., 2018). Due to the spatial and temporal variability of
the environmental and crop characteristics, such a linear relationship
between sowing date and crop emergence are local and would be

by

difficult to establish without prior knowledge. Our approach on the
other hand, does not depend on local conditions (soil types, rainfall or
crop types (Table 1, Fig. 2)), does not require the identification of a
fixed number of days to backcast the emergence and is therefore more
suitable for diverse environments, as long as no-tillage is practiced.
The chances for a successful sowing detection were higher in the
first four days following the sowing (91% successful detections). In our
study, nearly half of the detected sowing occurred only one day after
the sowing (Fig. 8). Therefore, using satellites with a temporal resolu-
tion larger than four days such as Sentinel-2 or Landsat, may not
achieve as high accuracy of detection as in this study. In addition, we
expect that as the revisit time of CubeSat-based constellations will in-
crease over the years, the probability for a successful detection using
our approach will improve accordingly.
Detecting sowing dates at the field level requires both high spatial
and temporal resolution remote sensing data. Previous studies com-
monly worked at a region, county or state scale and did not directly
detect the sowing dates, as they often used low spatial resolution sa-
tellite data such as MODIS (250 m–1 km) to estimate sowing dates at
aggregated-level scale of multiple fields (e.g. Sakamoto et al., 2005;
Lobell et al., 2013; Urban et al., 2018). These limit the accuracy of the
estimations and the applications derived from these data. Additionally
these were unable to distinguish crops from natural vegetation (Urban
et al., 2018). In contrast to MODIS, which also has daily revisit time,
CubeSat satellites such as PlanetScope have the ability to map in-
dividual farms or fields and to represent the large heterogeneity of
management practices within and across fields (Jain et al., 2016). Our
methodology allowed the detection of field and even sub-field level
changes caused by sowing (Fig. 9). This capability can thus potentially
be used to monitor progress in sowing even at the sub-field scale.
Satellite-based studies on yield prediction traditionally used offi-
cially reported sowing dates (e.g. Sakamoto et al., 2005; Marinho et al.,
2014; Jin et al., 2016) or sowing dates based on farmers’ surveys (e.g.
Ortiz-Monasterio and Lobell, 2007; Jain et al., 2016). High-resolution
information of sowing dates in regional datasets could be used to re-
duce the uncertainty of regional yield prediction using crop simulations
(Mathison et al., 2017). However, the existence of such datasets is
currently scarce, since only few censuses collect this information or
make it publically available. Furthermore, when released, this data is
often shared at aggregated regional scales (Urban et al., 2018). Estab-
lishing a large-scale database of field/farm management practices is
time consuming, expensive, relies heavily on manual labour and re-
quires some training (Jain et al., 2016). The methodology presented in
this study, can be used to produce low-cost field level statistics with

unprecedented spatial coverage, which can be updated on a near-daily
basis. In addition, statistics at the field-level may improve our under-
standing of the reasons of yield gaps, and could assist to identify low-
performing fields that need to be treated in order to increase their
productivity (Jain et al., 2016). Our CubeSats-based change detection
methodology also has the potential to be implemented to monitor ra-
pidly changing environments in other disciplines such as for geomor-
phological and natural disaster/hazards studies. For example, assem-
bling information on tillage is important for soil erosion modelling,
despite the impracticability of collecting such information using ground
surveys (Mc Nairn et al., 1998).
4.3. Limitations and perspectives

Despite its very high accuracy, our sowing detection methodology
has limitations. Although the approach presented here can overcome
the presence of a few small-scattered clouds in the scene as a field is
considered as sown only if the area detected as changed exceeds 25% of
the field’s area, most of the failed and false detections (50% of the failed
detection and 60% of the false detections in the Birchip farm) were
caused by the presence of clouds. The presence of cloud shadows in the
images on the other hand was found to have less impact on results. This
is due to the fact that the areas covered by cloud shadows produced low
values in the histogram of the ratio image, which are not high enough
to be considered as “changed”. We believe that it is possible to over-
come some of the failed and false detections caused by the presence of
clouds and cloud shadows in the images (depending on the percentage
of the coverage in the image) by masking the clouds and cloud shadows
out of the images (Kolecka et al., 2018). There are a number of auto-
mated cloud and cloud shadow detection methods presented in the
literature, e.g. Fmask (Function of mask) (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012;
Frantz et al., 2015). However, these methods commonly use SWIR
bands as they are offering a high contrast between cloudy and cloud
free pixels (Sedano et al., 2011). PlanetScope satellites do not operate in
the SWIR and therefore future studies will investigate how to adapt the
existing cloud and cloud shadow detection methods to these new sa-
tellites. Another approach that should be investigated is to separate
cloud-based changes and sowing-based changes by analysing the shape
of their appearance in the image, as clouds ought to be quite different
from the mostly straight-line edges of sowed areas. Another way to
potentially overcome this limitation would be to integrate the Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) data into the change detection analysis. In con-
trast to optical sensing, SAR sensors have the advantages of all-weather
capabilities, and are not affected by the presence of clouds in the

577

ImagetPC11ImagetPC21Y. Sadeh et al.

imagery. While SAR data may facilitate change detection in cloudy
conditions, most of the spaceborne SAR systems do not have both the
required temporal resolution and the spatial resolution. There are few
SAR systems that operate at a high spatio-temporal resolution, but the
high costs of such SAR data will probably make an operational sowing
detection application impractical.
Another drawback is imposed by mosaicking of same-day images
acquired by different satellites. We have noticed that when we mo-
saicked images from different CubeSats in the constellation, they pro-
vide a good visual coverage of the study area. However, using these
mosaics to calculate the ratio-images prevented us from setting a con-
stant value for histogram thresholding, even when both images were
acquired on the same day. Therefore, in the case of a field separated
into two parts in two images, the same threshold cannot be used for
both parts of the field. But it was very rare that a sown field was present
in two images.
Our method has been developed for the no-tillage sowing practice.
While this sowing practice is now common worldwide for rainfed crops
(Kassam et al., 2015), our method is currently limited to regions where
no-tillage sowing is being implemented. Yet, we believe that our ap-
proach could also be valid for other types of sowing. This potentially
can be done by detecting the last field scale change on the soil surface
before the seedling emergence. Once the crops can be detected by a
vegetation index (e.g. NDVI) similar to the green-up approach (Lobell
et al., 2013), we can estimate the date when the last field scale change
was detected, which is likely to be the sowing date.
Currently our sowing detection method is still semi-automated, as
users need to identify the pixel values that correspond to a change in the
image histogram, in order to determine the threshold to classify pixels as
‘changed’ or ‘not changed’ (Fig. 5). Additionally, our method uses the
polygons to identify field locations, which were known in this study. In
order to fully automate the process the two inputs (pre-determined
threshold and the polygons of the fields) need to be identified auto-
matically. This potentially can be achieved by implementing machine-
learning techniques (Toulouse et al., 2016) to identify the pixels that
represents change in the histogram. We propose that future studies
should explore the ability to use clustering algorithms such as K-Means,
Fuzzy K-Means and the self-organizing map (SOM) to perform automatic
classification (Kanungo et al., 2002; Zhong et al., 2006; Gonçalves et al.,
2008; Kussul et al., 2017). Automation of this process is necessary in
order to turn this prototype into an operational application. The location
and boundaries of the fields, expressed as geo-located polygons can be
also identified using remote sensing by implementing classification and
segmentation techniques (Van der Sande et al., 2003; McCarty et al.,
2017). Previous studies showed that time-series images could success-
fully be used to identify crop fields, classify between irrigated and non-
irrigated crops (Jin et al., 2016; Azzari and Lobell, 2017; Zhang et al.,
2018), classify crop types (Van Niel and McVicar, 2004) and to preform
cropland area segmentation (Gallego et al., 2014; McCarty et al., 2017).
Perhaps the main difficulties in the context of our method will be the
separation between rainfed crops from the natural vegetation and the
accurate delineation of the field boundaries. However, as rainfed crop
fields in developed countries commonly tend to be large in size (> 10 ha)
and in a square shape, we believe that implementing existing methods
will probably achieve high accuracy.
Despite the inconsistency of spectral data, CubeSats are only
starting to unleash their potential. We strongly believe that as more
advanced CubeSat constellations are deployed into space, the number
of CubeSats-based applications at the field or farm level will increase
and their efficacy for detecting sowing and harvesting dates will im-
prove.
5. Conclusions

In this study, we developed an innovative semi-automated sowing
detection methodology, based on Planet’s PlanetScope data to detect

changes on field surface caused by sowing. The method detected 85% of
the sown fields with a very high correlation ( = 0.99) between actual
and estimated dates. Time of sowing was detected with a median gap of
0 days while achieving RMSE of 0.9 and 1.9 days in a national set of
data and in a representative commercial farm, respectively. The ap-
proach may be used to produce and update near-daily low-cost field
level statistics in an unprecedented spatial coverage. To fully automate
sowing detection at the field scale, machine-learning techniques could
be explored to identify automatically parts of a histogram corre-
sponding to a change in spectrum (due to soil disturbance). Automation
will also require the integration of classification and segmentation
techniques to detect the fields’ location and to extract their boundaries.
Methods to account for clouds present in the images would also im-
prove the applicability of the method. We expect that in the future, the
accuracy of this method will increase as more and more CubeSats
constellations become operational.
