Abstract
Rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield and grain quality are highly influenced by the planting
date; thus, it is crucial to determine the optimal planting window for an area of cul-

tivation. In this study, date of planting experiments conducted at the Louisiana State

University (LSU) AgCenter Rice Research Station from 2011 to 2018 were analyzed

to quantify the effect of planting date, genotype, and year on key agronomic traits.

Planting date was strongly associated with yield across every year, explaining 55.6%

of the overall phenotypic variation. A clear relationship was observed between later

plantings and reduced yields; and the highest yields were observed during plantings

between 11 and 31 March. Rice planted after the optimal planting window displays a

yield reduction following a cubic regression trend. Planting date was associated with

milling yield, explaining 28.6% of the phenotypic variation, however the effect size

varied year to year. Milling yields were highest with the early and late planting dates,

while reduced milling yields were observed in plantings between mid-April and early

June. Days to heading and days to seedling emergence were strongly associated with

planting date; with planting date explaining, on average, 86 and 96% of the variation,

respectively. Plant height was less influenced by planting date, with genotype being

the largest source of variation. The results from this study highlight the importance

of choosing the optimal planting date and identifies an optimal planting window to

maximize grain and milling yield for Southwest Louisiana.

INTRODUCTION

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity is highly influenced by
planting date. When rice is planted under ideal conditions
with favorable air and soil temperatures and appropriate soil
moisture, the performance of the crop drastically improves.
Planting too early can expose the crop to cold tempera-
tures and result in poor germination, low seeding vigor, and
seedling mortality (Dou & Tarpley, 2012; Saichuk et al.,

planting window.

2014). Planting too late often causes reduced yields and grain
quality as the reproductive phase coincides with the height of
the summer heat and rice grain yield and quality are nega-
tively affected (Lanning et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2019). Thus,
determining the optimal planting time is critical to maximize
yield and grain quality.

In Louisiana, rice can be dry seeded, either drilled in nar-
row rows or broadcast, or water seeded (Smith & Dilday,
2003). The drill seeding method requires the soil to be dry
for the utilization of planting equipment, while the water
seeding method can be performed regardless of soil mois-
ture. Water seeding rice can result in earlier planting, red rice

suppression, and rapid stand establishment (Dunand, 1988;
Griffin et al., 1986). Water-seeded rice is usually pre-sprouted
to initiate germination and decrease emergence time by soak-
ing the seed in water for 24–36 h and then draining it for
24–36 h (Saichuk et al., 2014). Several studies have been
conducted at the H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station
(HRCRRS) near Crowley, LA, to determine the optimal plant-
ing window dating back to 1933 when Jenkins tested four vari-
eties across different planting dates for 6 yr (Jenkins, 1944).
He concluded that rice performed the best when planted from
April until 15 May. Following experiments were conducted
from 1950 to 1952 (Jodon, 1953), 1953 to 1961 (Adair et al.,
1973), and 1963 to 1969 (Jodon and McIlrath, 1971), which
all registered that rice performed best when planted between
late March and early May. A study (Slaton et al., 2003)
conducted between 1995 and 2000 using present-day vari-
eties, which are shorter in stature and earlier maturing, con-
cluded that the optimal planting window for drill-seeded rice
in Southwest Louisiana was between mid-February through
March. While previous experiments were drill seeded, a study
on water-seeded rice across different planting dates was con-
ducted from 2003 to 2005 at the HRCRRS (Blanche & Lin-
scombe, 2009; Sha & Linscombe, 2007). In this study, the
highest yields were obtained when the rice was planted from
the beginning to the middle of April, which was later than
the results of the drill-seeded rice experiments. Water-seeded
rice planted later in the season was also subject to yield loss
and poor grain quality (Sha & Linscombe, 2007). These previ-
ous experiments highlight the importance of planting as soon
as the conditions are ideal for rice germination and growth
and that those dates vary based on the planting method. Opti-
mal growing conditions at planting ensure better seedling
growth which reduces weed pressure and cost for its man-
agement (Gravois & Helms, 1998). Higher temperatures dur-
ing grain filling seem to negatively affect head rice yield,
and disease pressure and insect damage could increase dur-
ing later plantings (Sha & Linscombe, 2007). On the other
hand, rice planted too early is at risk for poor germination
and poor stand, which can lead to reduced yields (Gravois &
Helms, 1998; Saichuk et al., 2014). Speed and rate of germi-
nation are highly temperature dependent, and rice should not
be planted when the average air and soil temperature is below
15 ˚C (Smith & Dilday, 2003). In addition, seedling growth
is highly influenced by temperature, especially during the 1st
week of growth (Yoshida, 1981).

recommendations

Southwest
Louisiana are between 10 March and 15 April; how-
ever, the moment of planting has to be chosen considering
specific field conditions that might vary every year (Harrell
et al., 2020; Saichuk et al., 2014). Average daily temperatures
C, calculated by averaging the daily high and low
above 10
temperatures, are considered critical to obtain an acceptable
stand (Saichuk et al., 2014). In practice, rice producers

Core Ideas
∙ Planting date is a major component in yield and

agronomic traits in rice.

∙ The optimal planting window in South Louisiana

was from 10 to 31 March.

∙ A yield reduction of 47.8 kg ha

observed for each day planting is delayed past
31 March.

∙ The optimal planting date for a specific year varies

based on environmental and soil conditions.

occasionally begin planting earlier based on existing and
forecasted weather. On average, from 2015 to 2019 in
Louisiana 6% of the total land area was planted before
15 March, 18% before 22 March, 41% before 29 March, 64%
before 5 April, 76% before 12 April, 82% before 20 April,
and 89% before 3 May (NASS, 2020). Earlier plantings
also increase the possibility to harvest the second crop.
Along the Gulf Coast the extended growing season facilitates
the production of a second crop (ratoon) of rice from the
stubble of the main crop. Upon harvesting of the first crop,
the stubble is manipulated, fertilized, and reflooded. The
second crop typically matures in 3 mo, which is two-thirds
to three-fourths of the time needed by the main crop to reach
maturity (Bollich & Turner, 1988). Thus, if rice is planted
before the second half of April (Harrell et al., 2020), it would
be ready for harvest at mid-August, the second crop could
develop before the cold weather occurs, and an acceptable
ratoon yield could be achieved (Dou et al., 2016; Harrell
et al., 2020; Saichuk et al., 2014). Historically, there has
only been a 10% chance that the first frost would occur by 8
November and 50% by 29 November in Southwest Louisiana
(NOAA, 2020). On average from 2015 to 2019, 46% of the
total Southwest Louisiana rice land area was destined to grow
a ratoon crop (Harrell, 2020).

Every year, the breeding program at the HRCRRS conducts
a date of planting experiment that includes current and poten-
tial varieties. Drill seeding is now the predominant planting
method in Louisiana, accounting for 62% of the total land area
from 2015 to 2019 (Harrell, 2020). Starting in 2011, the date
of planting experiment began being drill seeded to reflect the
most common production practices. This study focuses on the
drill-seeded date of planting data produced from 2011 to 2018
and provides useful insights of an optimal planting window
for drill-seeded rice in South Louisiana. The objective of this
study is to verify if the current recommended planting window
corresponds to empirical data on most current germplasm and
quantify the average loss when rice is planted outside the opti-
mal window.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The experiments were conducted during the rice-growing sea-
son from 2011 to 2018 at the HRCRRS near Crowley, LA
(30˚14′30″ N, 92˚20′46″W) on a Crowley silt loam soil (fine,
smectitic, hyperthermic Typic Albaqualf). Each year between
12 and 13 genotypes were planted across eight planting dates
except for 2014 and 2015, which had seven planting dates.
Planting dates were tentatively spaced by 2 wk; see exact
date for each year in supplemental information (Supplemen-
tal Table S1). Across the entirety of the experiment, 38 differ-
ent genotypes were tested. The genotypes tested, represented
the common commercial variety classes grown in Louisiana:
long and medium grains, herbicide tolerant and susceptible,
hybrids, and aromatic.

The experiments were based on a split-plot design with
planting dates as the main plot and genotypes as subplots. The
main plots were not replicated while subplots were completely
randomized within the main plots with three replications. The
experiments were conducted on a Crowley silt loam soil, and
the fields were fallow the previous season. Rice was drill
seeded in plots 1.42 m wide and 4.12 m long with an Heavy-
−1
Duty Grain Drill (ALMACO) at a seeding rate of 100 kg ha
−1 for hybrids, at a depth of 2 cm.
for varieties and 37 kg ha
The water management and fertilization followed the standard
practices for Louisiana rice (Saichuk et al., 2014). No seed
treatments or fungicides were applied. Grain yield was deter-
mined by harvesting the entire plot with a Delta Plot com-
bine (Wintersteiger AG), and a Harvest Master Grain Gauge
(Juniper Systems) was used to collect grain weight and mois-
−1
ture. Moisture values of each plot were adjusted to 120 g kg
water content. One milling sample was hand harvested from
one plot for each genotype in every planting date. The milling
sample was split into two technical replicates (100 g) and
milled on a PAZ laboratory mill (ZaccariaUSA) to measure
−1 of whole milled kernels over
milling yield expressed as g kg
rough rice seed. Days to emergence was measured as the num-
ber of days between planting and the date in which 50% of the
plot had emerged from the soil. Seedling vigor was scored
based on a visual rating of 1–9, with higher vigor associated
with a lower rating number. Days to heading was measured as
the number of days between the date of emergence and the day
when 50% of the plot has panicles emerging from the sheath of
the flag leaf. Plant height was measured as centimeters from
the soil surface to the panicle tip at maturity.

All statistical analyses were conducted with the statistical
programming language R (R Core Team, 2020) and package
lme4 (Bates et al., 2015), and figures were produced using
the package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). The portions of vari-
ation were calculated as the amount of the sum of squares for
each effect divided by the total sum of squares obtained from
the ANOVA. In variation partitioning across years, an initial
model was run with year treated as random effect. No vari-

ation was observed with the fixed effect model for genotype
and planting date. Further analysis was conducted by treating
all effects as fixed. Comparison between planting windows
was performed on relative values of every genotype within a
year with Tukey’s HSD test at a significance level of p ≤ .05.
Different regression models were fitted (linear, quadratic,
cubic, and quartic) for relative grain yield for day of the year.
The one with the highest R2 value, the cubic regression, was
selected to predict yield. Yield prediction for different plant-
ing dates was estimated by fitting the cubic polynomial equa-
tion for the selected calendar day:

𝑌 = 𝑏0 + 𝑏1𝑥 + 𝑏2𝑥

where Y is grain yield, b0 is the intercept, x is the planting
day of the year, b1 is the linear coefficient, b2 is the quadratic
coefficient, and b3 is the cubic coefficient.

across years

To determine the effect of planting date on key agronomic
traits in rice, an 8 yr data set was analyzed to quantify the por-
tions of total variation explained by planting date, genotype,
and planting date × genotype interaction. As commercial and
potential varieties are continuously changing, the set of geno-
types tested each year varies; however, some genotypes were
tested across multiple years. The analysis was first conducted
within each year individually. Planting date was the primary
source of variation for yield in 7 out of the 8 yr, with values
ranging from 30.4 to 81.9% of the total variation explained,
averaging 55.6% (Table 1). The genotype effect was the sec-
ond largest source of variation for yield in each year, except
for Year 2014. Genotype accounted for 9.5–36.2% of the total
variation (22.3% average over all years). In Year 2016, the
variance explained by planting date was relatively smaller
because of the greater amount of variation determined by
genotype. This was caused by the higher number of hybrids
tested which are characterized by higher grain yield compared
to inbred varieties. In Year 2013, the planting date effect was
reduced relative to other years as a result of unseasonably
colder and wetter soil conditions that occurred in late March
and early April, which caused reduced stands and poor growth
in the earlier planted rice. These conditions resulted in simi-
lar yield values between earlier and later planted trials, which
reduced the effect of planting date. The large difference in
the variance partitioning in Year 2011 was influenced by the
high yield values of rice that was planted in February, which

was due to the early warm weather and ideal growing condi-
tions registered that year (Saichuk, 2013). The lower amount
of variation explained by the interaction of planting date with
genotype reveal the high stability in performance of the geno-
types across different planting dates.

While grain yield showed a constant trend in which plant-
ing date was the main source of variation across years, milling
yield did not (Table 1). The different impacts of planting date,
genotype, and their interaction within the different years indi-
cates that yearly conditions play a determining role in milling
yield. In Years 2011, 2012, and 2014, planting date was the
greatest source of variation, while in 2013, 2015, and 2018,
the genotype effect was the largest variation proportion. In
2016 and 2017, the interaction of the genotype and plant-
ing date effects was the greatest portion of the variation. The
higher incidence of the interaction of planting date and geno-
type indicates that some varieties are more stable than oth-
ers in their milling yield across different environmental con-
ditions.

The variance partitioning for days to heading, plant height,
seedling vigor, and emergence date were recorded each year
to quantify the influence of planting date (Supplemental
Table S2). Days to heading was greatly affected by plant-
ing date across all years. Planting date explained on average
85.5% of the total variation with values ranging from 72.5
to 94.5% within each year. Plant height was less affected by
planting date, with genotype consistently being the largest
component of variation, averaging 54.3% and values ranging
from 21 to 85.4% within a given year. The largest sources of
variation for seedling vigor were planting date and genotype,
with average values of 30.4 and 31.3%, respectively. The vari-
ation of days to emergence was nearly exclusively explained
by planting date, averaging 95.5% of the total variation within
each year.

Planting date, genotype, and year

To investigate the effect of the yearly conditions, a sample
of seven genotypes that were each tested across 4 yr (2015–
2018) were analyzed to determine the contribution of plant-
ing date, genotype, year, and all of the possible interactions
to the overall variance for the key agronomic traits (Table 2).
The subset of genotypes represented the common commer-
cial variety classes grown in Louisiana: long and medium
grains, herbicide tolerant and susceptible, and one hybrid.
Similar to the observations within each year, planting date was
the largest variance component for grain yield when looking
across years. Planting date accounted for 41.4% of the total
variation, while genotype was 22.1%, and the interaction of
year and planting date was 12.3%. Year effect accounted for a
minimal portion of the total variation, 0.8%. The minimal year

effect can largely be explained by the fact that these trials are
grown under water managed and flooded conditions, so there
is no year effect associated with annual precipitation. Whereas
in most rainfed crops, year effects are a large component of the
variation and are largely driven by differences in precipitation
between years. The interaction of planting date and genotype
was low as well, indicating that there are no remarkable dif-
ferences between genotypes across years and planting dates.
As observed within years, milling yield was significantly
influenced by the year. The largest source of variation across
years was the interaction of planting date with genotype
and year, explaining 22.8% of the total variation. The sec-
ond largest effect was the interaction of genotype with year
(19.9%) and third was the year effect (14.9%). These observa-
tions suggest that there are conditions that occur yearly, within
specific genotypes or planting dates, or combinations of both
that reduce the relative variance explained by planting date
and genotype alone.

Days to heading was largely influenced by planting date,
which accounted for 50.2% of the total variation. In addition,
21% was explained by the interaction of planting date with
year; suggesting that part of the variation due to planting date
was accounted in the variation of planting dates throughout
years when different weather conditions occurred. Year plays
a small role in affecting maturity.

As expected, plant height is mainly determined by the
genotype effect, which explains 40.8% of the overall pheno-
typic variation. Still, a portion of variation is determined by
planting date and its interaction with years, with 10.8 and
13.1%, respectively. No significant differences were observed
across years.

3.2

Optimum planting window

As planting date significantly affects key economic traits in
rice production, it is critical to choose the optimal planting
time to maximize performance and mitigate risk. The ability
to plant rice by drill seeding requires appropriate field condi-
tions that are dependent on soil moisture; thus, for this exper-
iment, it was not possible to plant on the same calendar day
every year or perfectly space dates between plantings. There-
fore, the different planting dates were grouped into planting
windows to determine with confidence the optimum time for
planting rice in Southwest Louisiana (Table 3). To account
for the variability of the heterogeneous sets of genotypes and
the yearly environmental variations, planting windows were
compared within each year by calculating the relative values
for each genotype across planting windows.

On average, rice showed the highest grain yield poten-
tial when planted in planting window (PW) 2 (PW2) and
PW3 (from 11 to 31 March); no significant differences were
recorded between these planting windows (Figure 1). Thus,

we suggest that this planting window could be considered
as optimal for drill-seeded rice cultivation in Southwest
Louisiana. Although not statistically different, PW2 did show
higher average yields compared to PW3, suggesting that, on
average, planting earlier in the recommended window is pre-
ferred. Lower yield values were observed for PW1 and PW4,
with a decrease of 10.8% for both. No significant differences
were observed between PW1 and PW4. Grain yield decreased
considerably after PW3, stabilizing at PW7 and PW8 which
were not significantly different. The variation of the rela-
tive yields within planting window were the lowest at PW3,
slightly higher at PW2, and increased in later plantings. At

PW1 the variation was one of the highest suggesting that early
plantings are the most subjected to fluctuations of grain yield
potential because of yearly weather conditions: in years with
favorable growing conditions very early in the season, PW1
performed very well, but in years with unfavorable condi-
tions early in the season, PW1 did very poorly. Conversely,
PW3 was the most stable across years, suggesting that in most
years this window provides appropriate or optimal conditions
for planting. It is important to notice that for Years 2011
and 2017 the highest yield values were recorded at the ear-
lier part of PW1, while in Years 2015 and 2018, no signif-
icant differences were recorded within the optimal window

Relative values of genotypes across all years and planting windows for (a) grain yield, 286 (b) milling yield, (c) days to heading, and

(PW2–PW3) and PW4. In Years 2013 and 2014, PW5 was
comparable to earlier planting windows. This indicates that
the choice of planting must consider year-specific weather and
soil conditions and the weather forecast. Planting is optimal
before PW2–PW3 if soil and air temperature are warm or later
if cold and wet conditions are present. When comparing the
growing cycle of rice planted in different times of the year, it
was noticed that PW1, PW2, and PW3 flowered with few days
of difference, while for later plantings, the vegetative growth
was faster. Previous studies suggested that the yield losses in
rice planted later are related to the shorter length of the veg-
etative growth during which plants accumulate less dry mat-

ter reducing yield potential (Gravois & Helms, 1998; Slaton
et al., 2003). Other explanations given for the higher yield loss
during later plantings can be found in the higher blast disease
(Magnaporthe grisea) pressure (Gravois & Helms, 1998) and
heavier rice water-weevil insect (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus)
pressure (Sha & Linscombe, 2007).

The observations of variation partitioning showed that
milling yield is less influenced by planting date than grain
yield. However, statistically significant differences were
observed across planting windows (Figure 1). High relative
values were reported when rice was planted during PW1,
PW2, PW3, and PW8, from late February to the end of March

and at the last planting in June. After this optimal window,
milling yield drops at PW4 and slightly increases with follow-
ing plantings. Similar to grain yield, earlier plantings within
the optimal window showed higher relative values of milling
yield. As already presented by Sha and Linscombe (2007),
this trend is likely explained by the period in which grain
maturation occurs during the growing season. When rice is
planted in the earlier windows, it is flowering, and the grain
is maturing before the extremely high temperatures in mid-
summer. The rice planted in mid-April (PW4) is typically
maturing during the hottest time of the summer months, which
leads to a reduction in milling yield. This is reflected also in
the highest average values in PW8 when rice matures in lower
night and day temperatures of September and October.

Rice maturity was significantly affected by planting date
(Figure 1). The amount of days required for flowering is
highly correlated to the amount of growing degree days, which
is the daily accumulation of heat units during the crop’s
growth. Thus, the later rice is planted, the more growing
degree days it will receive in the early stages of development,
resulting in earlier flowering. Differences can be very signif-
icant since the same lines can flower 25 d earlier on average
if planted during PW8 instead of PW1. This trend is observed
in production fields when farmers plant their fields over a
period of a few weeks, and then it is all ready for harvest at
the same time.

Plant height was slightly affected by planting window
because it is more genotype dependent as observed in the
explained variance portion. Still, on average, lower values
were observed in the early and late planting windows (PW1
and PW8) (Figure 1). Contrarily, seedling vigor showed sig-
nificant differences across planting windows (Supplemen-
tal Figure S1.). The highest value was recorded at PW6,
while in the earlier plantings it decreases to reach the low-
est value at PW1. This tendency is likely explained by
the colder and wetter weather and soil conditions that are
more likely to occur during earlier planting windows and
are responsible for slower germination and growth of the
seedling.

3.3

Yield potential and loss

The choice of planting date is critical in determining grain
yield potential; therefore, a model was fitted to predict the
average yield for each calendar day and define the potential
yield loss for delayed plantings (Figure 2). For each year, the
average yield of all genotypes at each planting date expressed
in calendar day was divided by the value of the best per-
forming planting date for that year. The use of relative val-
ues excludes in part the variation related with testing different
sets of genotypes across years and yearly environmental fluc-
tuation. Different models were fitted: the polynomial cubic
regression showed the best fit with a R2 of .565, compared
to the quadratic regression which had a R2 of .5169 (Supple-
mental Figure S2). The polynomial cubic regression was pre-
viously used for analysis in a similar study on rice by Slaton
et al. (2003) and in other crops, such as corn (Zea mays L.)
(Lauer et al., 1999) and hard red winter wheat (Blue et al.,
1990). The shape of the predicted grain yield line is compara-
ble with the planting windows results (Figure 1): the optimal
planting window appears to be between 10 March and the end
of March, while potential yield significantly decreases at later
plantings. The polynomial formula of the model was used to
calculate the theoretical optimal planting date which resulted
to be calendar Day 79 (20 March). Using this date as 100%
yield potential, it takes 18 d (8 April) until we see a 5% reduc-
tion in yield (Table 4). However, the next 5% yield reduction
occurs after only 9 d (17 April), and the next 5% reduction is
only 7 d after that (24 April). On average, 20% of yield could
be lost when rice is planted in early May. When rice is planted
after 31 March the average daily yield loss is 0.54%, assum-
−1 during the optimal
ing the average yield of 8,850.2 kg ha
planting window, every day planting is delayed equates to a
−1. Thus, grain yield is significantly
reduction of 47.8 kg ha
reduced with time when rice is planted outside the optimal
planting window, underlining the importance of planting rice

CONCLUSION

Throughout the years, the recommended optimal planting
window in Southwest Louisiana has changed, from early April
to May in the first half of the 1900s to to the current window
from mid-March to mid-April. This study conducted on the
current elite varieties and across several years indicates that
producers are encouraged to drill-seed rice between 10 March
and the end of March. Reduced losses in yield and grain
milling can occur in the first half of April, but significant
losses are likely with more delayed plantings. However, each
year the choice of date of planting must consider the specific
field conditions and existing and forecasted weather since
optimal conditions can occur at different moments across dif-
ferent years. If planting requirements are met, earlier planted
rice possess the highest yield and grain quality potential, and
it has a higher chance to produce a successful ratoon crop.
