of the overall phenotypic variation. A clear relationship was observed  between later plantings and 
reduced yields; and the highest yields were observed during plantings between 11 and 31 March. Rice 
planted after the optimal planting window displays a yield reduction following a cubic regression 
trend. Planting date was associated with milling yield, explaining  28.6â of the phenotypic  
variation, however the effect size varied year to year. Milling yields were highest with the early 
and late planting dates, while reduced milling yields were observed in plantings between mid-April 
and early June. Days to heading and days to seedling emergence were strongly associated with 
planting date; with planting date explaining, on average, 86 and 96% of the variation, 
respectively. Plant height was less influenced by planting date, with genotype being the largest 
source of variation. The results from this study highlight the importance of choosing  the optimal  
planting date and identifies an optimal planting window to maximize grain and milling yield for 
Southwest Louisiana.



1      INTRODUCTION

Rice (Ory7a  sativa  L.)  productivity  is  highly  influenced  by planting  date.  When  rice  is  
planted  under  ideal  conditions with favorable air and soil temperatures  and appropriate  soil 
moisture,  the  performance  of  the crop  drastically  improves. Planting  too  early  can  expose 
 the  crop  to  cold  tempera- tures and result in poor germination,  low seeding  vigor, and 
seedling  mortality  (Dou  &  Tarpley,  2012;  Saichuk  et  al.,

Abbreviations:  HRCRRS, H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station; PW, planting  window.
2tJ14). Planting too late often causes reduced yields and grain quality as the reproductive phase 
coincides with the height of the  summer  heat  and  rice grain  yield  and  quality  are  nega- 
tively affected (Lanning et a1., 2012; Wu et a1., 2019). Thus, determining the optimal planting 
time is critical to maximize yield and grain quality.
In Louisiana, rice can be dry seeded, either drilled in nar- row  rows  or  broadcast,  or  water  
seeded  (Smith  &  Dilday, 2003).  The  drill seeding  method  requires  the  soil  to be dry for  
the  utilization  of  planting  equipment,  while  the  water seeding  method  can  be  performed  
regardless  of  soil  mois- ture. Water seeding rice can result in earlier planting, red rice

suppression,  and  rapid  stand  establishment  (Dunand,  1988; Griffin et al., 1986). Water-seeded 
rice is usually pre-sprouted to initiate germination and decrease emergence time by soak- ing  the  
seed  in  water  for  24-36  h  and  then  draining  it  for 24-36  h  (Saichuk  et  a1.,  2(114).  
Several  studies  have  been conducted  at  the  H.  Rouse  Caffey  Rice  Research  Station 
(HRCRRS) near Crowley, LA, to determine the optimal plant- ing window dating back to 1933 when 
Jenkins tested four vari- eties across different  planting  dates for 6 yr (Jenkins,  1944). He 
concluded that rice performed  the best when planted from April  until  15  May.  Following  
experiments  were  conducted from 1950 to 1952 (Jodon,  1953), 1953 to 1961 (Adair et al.,
1973),  and 1963 to 1969 (Jodon  and McIlrath,  1971), which all registered that rice performed  
best when planted  between late  March  and  early  May.  A  study  (Slaton  et  al.,  2003) 
conducted  between  1995  and  2000  using  present-day  vari- eties,  which  are shorter  in 
stature and earlier  maturing,  con- cluded that the optimal planting window for drill-seeded  rice 
in  Southwest  Louisiana  was  between  mid-February  through March. While previous experiments 
were drill seeded, a study on water-seeded  rice across different planting dates was con- ducted 
from 2003 to 2005 at the HRCRRS  (Blanche  & Lin- scombe,  2009;  Sha  &  Linscombe,  2007).  In  
this  study,  the highest  yields were obtained when the rice was planted from the  beginning  to  
the  middle  of  April,  which  was  later  than the results of the drill-seeded rice experiments. 
Water-seeded rice planted later in the season  was also subject  to yield loss and poor grain 
quality (Sha & Linscombe, 2(J07). These previ- ous experiments highlight the importance of planting 
as soon as  the  conditions  are  ideal  for  rice  germination  and  growth and that those dates 
vary based on the planting method. Opti- mal  growing  conditions  at  planting  ensure  better  
seedling growth  which  reduces  weed  pressure  and  cost  for  its  man- agement (Gravois & 
Helms,  1998). Higher temperatures  dur- ing  grain  filling  seem  to  negatively  affect  head  
rice  yield, and  disease  pressure  and  insect  damage  could  increase  dur- ing  later  
plantings  (Sha  &  Linscombe,  2(Jtl7).  On  the  other hand,  rice  planted  too  early  is  at  
risk  for  poor  germination and poor stand, which can lead to reduced  yields (Gravois & Helms, 
1998; Saichuk et al., 2014). Speed and rate of germi- nation are highly temperature dependent, and 
rice should not be planted when the average air and soil temperature is below 15 ’C (Smith  & 
Dilday,  2t)fl3).  In  addition,  seedling  growth is highly influenced by temperature, especially 
during the 1st week of growth (Yoshida,  l9fi I).
Current     planting     recommendations     for     Southwest Louisiana   are   between   10   
March   and   15   April;   how- ever,  the  moment  of  planting  has  to  be  chosen  considering 
specific field conditions  that  might  vary every  year (Harrell et al., 2020; Saichuk et al., 
2014). Average daily temperatures above  10 ’C,  calculated  by averaging  the daily  high and low 
temperatures,  are considered  critical  to obtain  an  acceptable stand   (Saichuk   et  al.,   
2014).   In  practice,   rice  producers


Core Ideas
•  Planting  date  is  a  major  component  in  yield  and agronomic  traits in rice.
•  The optimal  planting  window  in South Louisiana was from 10 to 31 March.
•  A  yield  reduction  of  47.8  kg  ha*'   per  day  is observed  for  each  day  planting  is  
delayed  past 31 March.
•  The optimal planting date for a specific year varies based on environmental  and soil 
conditions.



occasionally   begin  planting  earlier  based  on  existing  and forecasted   weather.   On   
average,   from   2015   to   2019   in Louisiana   69c   of   the  total  land   area   was   
planted   before 15 March, 189  before 22 March, 41 to before 29 March, 649 before  5  April,  769a 
 before  12  April,  829c  before  20  April, and  899c   before  3  May   (NASS,   2()20).  
Earlier  plantings also  increase   the  possibility   to  harvest   the  second   crop. Along the 
Gulf Coast the extended growing season facilitates the  production  of  a  second  crop  (ratoon)  
of  rice  from  the stubble  of  the main  crop.  Upon  harvesting  of  the first crop, the  
stubble  is  manipulated,   fertilized,  and  reflooded.  The second  crop  typically  matures  in  
3 mo,  which  is  two-thirds to three-fourths  of the time needed by the main crop to reach 
maturity  (Bollich  &  Turner,  198fi).  Thus,  if  rice  is  planted before the second half of 
April (Harrell et al., 2020), it would be  ready  for  harvest  at  mid-August,  the  second  crop  
could develop  before  the  cold  weather  occurs,  and  an  acceptable ratoon  yield  could  be  
achieved  (Dou  et  a1.,  2016;  Harrell et  al.,  2020;  Saichuk  et  al.,  2014).  Historically,  
there  has only  been a 109c chance  that the first frost  would  occur  by 8 November and 509c by 
29 November in Southwest Louisiana (NOAA,  2020).  On  average  from  2015  to  2019,  469a  of  
the total Southwest Louisiana rice land area was destined to grow a ratoon crop (Harrell, 2020).
Every year, the breeding program at the HRCRRS conducts a date of planting experiment that includes 
current and poten- tial  varieties.  Drill  seeding  is now  the  predominant  planting method in 
Louisiana, accounting for 629a of the total land area from 2015 to 2019 (Harrell, 202()). Starting 
in 2011, the date of planting experiment began being drill seeded to reflect the most common 
production practices. This study focuses on the drill-seeded date of planting data produced from 
2011 to 2018 and  provides  useful  insights  of  an optimal  planting  window for drill-seeded 
rice in South Louisiana. The objective of this study is to verify if the current recommended 
planting window corresponds to empirical data on most current germplasm and quantify the average 
loss when rice is planted outside the opti- mal window.

2        MATERIAL AND METHODS

The experiments were conducted during the rice-growing sea- son  from  2011  to  2018  at  the  
HRCRRS  near  Crowley,  LA (30" l4'30” N, 92’20'46”W) on a Crowley silt loam soil (fine, smectitic, 
hyperthermic Typic Albaqualfl. Each year between 12 and 13 genotypes were planted across eight 
planting dates except  for  2014  and  2015,  which  had  seven  planting  dates. Planting  dates  
were  tentatively  spaced  by  2  wk;  see  exact date for each year in supplemental  information  
(Supplemen- tal Table S1). Across the entirety of the experiment, 38 differ- ent genotypes were 
tested. The genotypes tested, represented
ation was observed  with the fixed effect model for genotype and planting date. Further analysis 
was conducted by treating all  effects  as fixed.  Comparison  between  planting  windows was 
performed on relative values of every genotype within a year with Tukey's HSD test at a 
significance level of p < .05. Different regression  models  were fitted  (linear,  quadratic, 
cubic, and quartic) for relative grain yield for day of the year. The one with the highest R   
value, the cubic regression, was selected  to predict yield. Yield prediction for different plant- 
ing dates was estimated by fitting the cubic polynomial equa-
tion for the selected calendar day:

tolerant  and susceptible,

hybrids, and aromatic.
The  experiments  were  based  on  a  split-plot  design  with planting dates as the main plot and 
genotypes as subplots. The main plots were not replicated while subplots were completely randomized 
within the main plots with three replications. The experiments  were conducted on a Crowley silt 
loam soil, and the  fields  were  fallow  the  previous  season.  Rice  was  drill seeded in plots 
1.42 m wide and 4.12 m long with an Heavy- Duty Grain Drill (ALMACO) at a seeding rate of 100 kg 
ha*' for varieties  and 37 kg ha*'  for hybrids,  at a depth of  2 cm. The water management and 
fertilization followed the standard practices  for Louisiana  rice (Saichuk  et  al.,  2fl14).  No 
seed treatments or fungicides were applied. Grain yield was deter- mined  by  harvesting  the  
entire  plot  with  a  Delta  Plot  com- bine (Wintersteiger AG), and a Harvest Master Grain Gauge 
(Juniper Systems) was used to collect grain weight and mois- ture. Moisture values of each plot 
were adjusted to 120 g kg*' water content. One milling sample was hand harvested from one plot for 
each genotype in every planting date. The milling sample  was  split  into  two  technical  
replicates  (100  g)  and milled  on a PAZ laboratory  mill (ZaccariaUSA)  to measure milling yield 
expressed as g kg*’ of whole milled kernels over rough rice seed. Days to emergence was measured as 
the num- ber of days between planting and the date in which 509c of the plot  had  emerged  from  
the  soil. Seedling  vigor  was  scored based on a visual rating of 1-9, with higher vigor 
associated with a lower rating number. Days to heading was measured as the number of days between 
the date of emergence and the day when 509a of the plot has panicles emerging from the sheath of 
the flag leaf. Plant height was measured as centimeters from the soil surface to the panicle tip at 
maturity.
All statistical analyses  were conducted  with the statistical programming language  R (R Core 
Team, 2020) and package 1me4  (Bates  et  a1.,  2015),  and figures  were  produced  using the 
package ggplot2 (Wickham,  2016). The portions of vari- ation were calculated as the amount of the 
sum of squares for each effect divided by the total sum of squares obtained from the ANOVA.  In 
variation  partitioning across years, an initial model  was  run  with  year treated  as random  
effect.  No vari-
where  Y  is  grain  yield,  bp  is  the intercept,  x is  the  planting day of the year, b; is the 
linear coefficient, b   is the quadratic coefficient, and b   is the cubic coefficient.


3        RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1.1    1    Planting date and genotype effect
across years

To  determine  the  effect  of  planting  date  on  key  agronomic traits in rice, an 8 yr data set 
was analyzed to quantify the por- tions of total variation  explained  by planting date, genotype, 
and planting date x genotype interaction. As commercial and potential varieties are continuously 
changing, the set of geno- types tested each year varies; however, some genotypes were tested 
across multiple years. The analysis was first conducted within each year individually.  Planting 
date was the primary source of  variation for yield in 7 out of the 8 yr, with values ranging from 
30.4 to 81.99c  of  the total  variation  explained, averaging 55.69  (Table 1). The genotype 
effect was the sec- ond largest  source of  variation  for yield in each year, except for Year 
2014. Genotype accounted for 9.5—36.2% of the total variation  (22.39r  average  over  all  years). 
 In  Year  2016,  the variance  explained  by  planting  date  was  relatively  smaller because  of 
 the  greater  amount  of  variation  determined  by genotype.  This was caused  by  the higher 
number of  hybrids tested which are characterized  by higher grain yield compared to inbred 
varieties. In Year 2013, the planting date effect was reduced  relative  to  other  years  as  a  
result  of  unseasonably colder and wetter soil conditions  that occurred in late March and early 
April, which caused reduced stands and poor growth in the earlier planted rice. These conditions 
resulted in simi- lar yield values between earlier and later planted trials, which reduced  the  
effect  of  planting  date.  The  large  difference  in the variance partitioning in Year 2011 was 
influenced  by the high yield values of rice that was planted in February, which

was due to the early warm weather and ideal growing condi- tions registered  that year (Saichuk,  
2013). The lower amount of variation explained by the interaction of planting date with genotype 
reveal the high stability in performance of the geno- types across different planting dates.
While grain yield showed a constant trend in which plant- ing date was the main source of variation 
across years, milling yield did not (Table 1). The different impacts of planting date, genotype, 
and their interaction within the different years indi- cates that yearly conditions play a 
determining role in milling yield. In  Years  2011,  2012,  and 2014,  planting  date was  the 
greatest  source  of  variation,  while  in  2013,  2015,  and 2018, the  genotype  effect  was  
the  largest  variation  proportion.  In 2016  and  2017,  the  interaction  of  the  genotype  and 
 plant- ing date effects  was the greatest portion of the variation. The higher incidence of the 
interaction of planting date and geno- type  indicates  that  some  varieties  are  more  stable  
than  oth- ers in their milling  yield across different  environmental  con- ditions.
The variance partitioning for days to heading, plant height, seedling  vigor, and emergence  date 
were recorded  each year to  quantify   the  influence  of   planting  date  (Supplemental Table  
S2).  Days  to  heading  was  greatly  affected  by  plant- ing date across all years. Planting  
date explained  on average 85.59r  of  the  total  variation  with  values  ranging  from  72.5 to 
94.59r  within each year. Plant height  was less affected  by planting  date,  with  genotype  
consistently  being  the  largest component  of  variation,  averaging 54.39c and values ranging 
from 21 to 85.49c  within a given  year. The largest sources of variation for seedling vigor were 
planting date and genotype, with average values of 30.4 and 31.3%, respectively. The vari- ation  
of days to emergence  was nearly exclusively  explained by planting date, averaging 95.59r of the 
total variation within each year.


3.1.2      Planting  date, genotype, and year effect

To  investigate  the  effect  of  the  yearly  conditions,  a  sample of  seven  genotypes  that  
were each  tested  across  4 yr (2015— 2018)  were analyzed  to determine  the contribution  of  
plant- ing  date,  genotype,  year,  and all  of  the possible  interactions to the overall 
variance for the key agronomic  traits (Table 2). The  subset  of  genotypes  represented  the  
common  commer- cial  variety  classes  grown  in  Louisiana:  long  and  medium grains,  herbicide 
 tolerant  and  susceptible,  and  one  hybrid. Similar to the observations within each year, 
planting date was the largest  variance component  for grain yield when looking across  years.  
Planting  date  accounted  for 41.49c  of  the total variation,  while  genotype  was  22.ldc,  and 
 the interaction  of year and planting date was 12.39. Year effect accounted for a minimal portion 
of the total variation, 0.8%. The minimal year
effect can largely be explained  by the fact that these trials are grown under water managed and 
flooded conditions,  so there is no year effect associated with annual precipitation. Whereas in 
most rainfed crops, year effects are a large component of the variation and are largely driven by 
differences in precipitation between years. The interaction  of planting date and genotype was low 
as well, indicating  that there are no remarkable dif- ferences between genotypes across years and 
planting dates.
As observed  within  years,  milling  yield  was significantly influenced  by the year. The largest 
source of variation across years  was  the  interaction   of   planting  date  with  genotype and  
year,  explaining  22.89c  of  the  total  variation.  The  sec- ond  largest  effect  was  the 
interaction  of  genotype  with  year (19.99c) and third was the year effect (14.99c). These 
observa- tions suggest that there are conditions that occur yearly, within specific genotypes or 
planting dates, or combinations of both that  reduce  the  relative  variance  explained  by  
planting  date and genotype alone.
Days  to  heading  was  largely  influenced  by  planting  date, which accounted for 50.2â of the 
total variation. In addition, 21 No  was  explained  by  the  interaction  of  planting  date  with 
year; suggesting that part of the variation due to planting date was  accounted  in  the  variation 
 of  planting  dates  throughout years when different weather conditions occurred. Year plays a 
small role in affecting maturity.
As  expected,  plant  height  is  mainly  determined  by  the genotype effect,  which explains  
40.89  of  the overall  pheno- typic  variation.  Still, a portion  of  variation  is determined  
by planting  date  and  its  interaction  with  years,  with  10.8  and 13.1%, respectively. No 
significant differences were observed across years.


3.2        Optimum planting window

As  planting  date significantly  affects  key  economic  traits  in rice  production,  it  is 
critical  to  choose  the  optimal  planting time to maximize  performance and mitigate risk. The 
ability to plant rice by drill seeding requires appropriate field condi- tions that are dependent 
on soil moisture; thus, for this exper- iment,  it was not possible to plant on the same calendar  
day every year or perfectly space dates between plantings. There- fore, the different  planting  
dates  were  grouped  into  planting windows to determine  with confidence  the optimum time for 
planting  rice  in Southwest  Louisiana  (Table  3).  To  account for the variability of the 
heterogeneous  sets of genotypes and the yearly  environmental  variations,  planting  windows  
were compared  within each year by calculating  the relative  values for each genotype across 
planting windows.
On  average,  rice  showed  the  highest  grain  yield  poten- tial  when  planted  in  planting  
window  (PW)  2  (PW2)  and PW3 (from  11 to 31 March);  no significant  differences  were recorded 
 between  these  planting  windows  (Figure  1). Thus,

we  suggest  that  this  planting  window  could  be  considered as   optimal   for   drill-seeded  
 rice   cultivation   in   Southwest Louisiana. Although not statistically different, PW2 did show 
higher  average  yields compared  to PW3,  suggesting  that, on average,  planting earlier in the 
recommended  window is pre- ferred. Lower yield values were observed for PW1 and PW4, with a 
decrease of  10.89r  for both. No significant  differences were observed between PW1 and PW4. Grain 
yield decreased considerably  after PW3,  stabilizing  at PW7  and  PW8  which were  not  
significantly  different.  The  variation  of  the  rela- tive  yields  within  planting  window  
were the lowest  at PW3, slightly  higher  at  PW2,  and  increased  in  later  plantings.  At
PW 1 the  variation was one of the highest suggesting that early plantings are the most subjected 
to fluctuations of grain yield potential  because of  yearly  weather conditions:  in years  with 
favorable  growing  conditions  very  early  in  the season,  PW1 performed  very  well,  but  in  
years  with  unfavorable  condi- tions  early  in  the  season,  PW1  did  very  poorly.  
Conversely, PW3 was the most stable across years, suggesting that in most years this window 
provides appropriate or optimal conditions for  planting.  It  is  important  to  notice  that  for 
 Years  2011 and  2017  the  highest  yield  values  were recorded  at the ear- lier  part  of  
PW1,  while  in  Years  2015  and  2018,  no  signif- icant  differences  were  recorded  within  
the  optimal  window

(PW2—PW3)  and  PW4.  In  Years  2013  and  2014,  PW5  was comparable  to  earlier  planting  
windows.  This  indicates  that the choice of planting must consider year-specific weather and soil 
conditions  and the  weather forecast.  Planting  is optimal before PW2—PW3 if soil and air 
temperature are warm or later if cold  and  wet conditions  are present.  When  comparing  the 
growing cycle of rice planted in different times of the year, it was noticed that PW1, PW2, and PW3 
flowered with few days of difference,  while for later plantings, the vegetative growth was faster. 
Previous studies suggested  that the yield losses in rice planted later are related to the shorter 
length of the veg- etative growth during which plants accumulate  less dry mat-
ter reducing  yield potential  (Gravois  & Helms,  1998; Slaton et al., 2003). Other explanations 
given for the higher yield loss during later plantings can be found in the higher blast disease
{Magnaporthe  grisea) pressure (Gravois & Helms,  l99fi) and heavier  rice  water-weevil  insect 
{Lissorhaptrus oryzophilus) pressure (Sha & Linscombe,   2007).
The  observations   of   variation   partitioning   showed   that milling  yield  is  less  
influenced  by  planting  date  than  grain yield.   However,   statistically   significant   
differences   were observed  across  planting  windows  (Figure  1).  High  relative values  were  
reported  when  rice  was  planted  during  PWl, PW2, PW3, and PW8, from late February to the end 
of March

and  at  the last  planting  in June.  After  this  optimal  window, milling yield drops at PW4 and 
slightly increases with follow- ing plantings.  Similar  to grain yield, earlier plantings  within 
the optimal window showed higher relative values of milling yield.  As  already  presented  by  Sha 
 and  Linscombe  (2007), this  trend  is  likely  explained  by  the  period  in  which  grain 
maturation  occurs  during  the growing  season.  When  rice  is planted in the earlier  windows,  
it is flowering,  and  the grain is  maturing  before  the extremely  high  temperatures  in  mid- 
summer.  The  rice  planted  in  mid-April  (PW4)  is  typically maturing during the hottest time 
of the summer months, which leads to a reduction  in milling  yield. This is reflected also in the 
highest average values in PW8 when rice matures in lower night and day temperatures  of September 
and October.
Rice  maturity  was  significantly  affected  by  planting  date (Figure  1).  The  amount  of  
days  required  for  flowering  is highly correlated to the amount of growing degree days, which is 
 the  daily  accumulation  of  heat  units  during  the  crop's growth.  Thus,  the  later  rice  
is  planted,  the  more  growing degree days it will receive in the early stages of development, 
resulting in earlier flowering. Differences can be very signif- icant since the same lines can 
flower 25 d earlier on average if planted during PW8 instead of PW1. This trend is observed in  
production  fields  when  farmers  plant  their  fields  over  a period  of  a few  weeks,  and 
then it is all ready  for harvest  at the same time.
Plant  height   was  slightly   affected   by  planting   window because  it  is  more  genotype  
dependent  as  observed  in  the explained  variance  portion.  Still,  on  average,  lower  values 
were observed  in the early  and  late  planting  windows  (PW1 and PW8) (Figure  I). Contrarily,  
seedling vigor showed  sig- nificant  differences  across  planting  windows  (Supplemen- tal  
Figure  S1.).  The  highest  value  was  recorded  at  PW6, while  in  the  earlier  plantings  it  
decreases  to  reach  the  low- est  value   at  PW1.  This   tendency   is  likely   explained   
by the  colder  and  wetter  weather  and  soil  conditions  that  are more  likely  to  occur  
during  earlier  planting  windows  and are  responsible  for  slower  germination  and  growth  of 
 the seedling.


3.3        Yield potential and loss

The  choice  of  planting  date  is  critical  in  determining  grain yield  potential;  therefore, 
 a  model  was  fitted  to  predict  the average  yield for  each  calendar  day  and  define  the 
potential yield loss for delayed plantings (Figure 2). For each year, the average yield of all 
genotypes at each planting date expressed in  calendar  day  was  divided  by  the  value  of  the  
best  per- forming  planting  date for  that  year.  The  use of  relative  val- ues excludes in 
part the variation related with testing different sets of genotypes across years and yearly 
environmental  fluc- tuation.  Different  models  were  fitted:  the  polynomial  cubic regression  
showed  the  best  fit  with  a fi*  of  .565,  compared to the quadratic regression  which had a 
fi* of .5169 (Supple- mental Figure S2). The polynomial cubic regression  was pre- viously used for 
analysis in a similar study on rice by Slaton et a1.  (2003)  and  in other crops,  such as corn 
(Zea  mays  L.) (Lauer  et  al.,  1999)  and  hard  red  winter  wheat  (Blue  et  al., 199()). The 
shape of the predicted grain yield line is compara- ble with the planting windows results (Figure 
1): the optimal planting window appears to be between 10 March and the end of March, while 
potential yield significantly decreases at later plantings. The polynomial formula of the model was 
used to calculate the theoretical  optimal planting date which resulted to be calendar  Day  79 (20 
March).  Using  this date as  1009 yield potential, it takes 18 d (8 April) until we see a She 
reduc- tion in yield (Table 4). However,  the next 59r  yield reduction occurs after only 9 d (17 
April), and the next 5% reduction is only 7 d after that (24 April). On average, 20% of yield could 
be lost when rice is planted in early May. When rice is planted after 31 March  the average daily 
yield loss is 0.549c,  assum- ing the average  yield  of  8,850.2 kg ha*'  during  the optimal 
planting  window,  every  day  planting  is delayed  equates  to a reduction  of  47.8  kg ha*'. 
Thus,  grain  yield  is  significantly reduced  with  time  when  rice is  planted  outside  the  
optimal planting window, underlining the importance of planting rice

4        CONCLUSION

Throughout   the  years,  the  recommended  optimal  planting window in Southwest Louisiana has 
changed, from early April to May in the first half of the 1900s to to the current window from  
mid-March  to  mid-April.  This  study  conducted  on  the current elite varieties  and  across  
several  years indicates  that producers are encouraged to drill-seed rice between 10 March and  
the  end  of  March.  Reduced  losses  in  yield  and  grain milling  can  occur  in  the  first  
half  of  April,  but  significant losses are likely with more delayed plantings. However, each 
year the choice of date of  planting must consider the specific field  conditions  and  existing  
and  forecasted  weather  since optimal conditions can occur at different moments across dif- 
ferent years. If planting requirements are met, earlier planted rice possess the highest yield and 
grain quality potential, and it has a higher chance to produce a successful ratoon crop.
