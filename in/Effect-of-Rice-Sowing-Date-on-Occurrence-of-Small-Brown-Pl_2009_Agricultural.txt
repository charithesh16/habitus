Abstract

To understand the relationship between rice sowing date and occurrence of the rice small brown planthopper (SBPH)
Laodelphax striatellus Fallen and the epidemics of the planthopper-transmitted rice stripe viral (RSV) disease, four
sowing dates of rice were evaluated in 2006 and 2007.  The results showed that the peak density of SBPH and RSV
incidence in the nursery and in the transplanted field decreased with the delay of sowing date in single crop of japonica
rice in north Zhejiang Province of China.  The relationship between seedling RSV incidence at the end of the nursery trial
with sowing date was well described by Weibull equation.  The area under the curve of population dynamics (AUCPD or
planthopper-day accumulation) or the peak density of the planthopper in the nursery could be summarized by a logistic
equation.  RSV incidence in the transplanted fields could be characterized quantitatively by a multivariate regression
equation, including the variables of sowing date, peak density of the vector, and RSV incidence at the end of the nursery
trial.  That the descriptive model excluded the AUCPD in transplanted field implies that this variable is not necessary in
forecasting disease epidemics in the field.  The 2-year experiments sufficiently indicated that suitable sowing of rice could
be used as one of the effective measures to control the vector population and therefore the planthopper-transmitted RSV
on a larger scale.  The optimal sowing date for the single-cropped transplanted japonica rice is recommended from late
May to early June in north Zhejiang, China.

Key words: rice, sowing date, Laodelphax striatellus, rice stripe viral disease, epidemics

INTRODUCTION

The rice stripe disease is caused by rice stripe virus
(RSV) (Hibino 1996).  In the 1960s, it was prevalent in
China, Japan, Korea, and other countries; the popula-
tion had gradually decreased since then, even disap-
pearing in some regions (Hibino 1996; Jin et al. 1985).

But in the 1990s, the prevalence of rice stripe disease in
Jiangsu, Liaoning, Henan, Zhejiang provinces and Shang-
hai City, China,  became worse than before, posing a
serious threat to the security of rice production and the
country’s food supplies (Zhu et al. 2005).  In Jiaxing,
in the northern part of Zhejiang Province of China, in-
cidence of the disease has been increasing year by year
(Zhu et al. 2005, 2007; Sun et al. 2007; Zhang et al.

2006; Wang 2006; Cheng et al. 2002; Wang et al.
2008).  In 2007, the infected rice fields reached 17.6
thousand ha.  Besides, the disease vector, small brown
planthopper (SBPH) Laodelphax striatellus (Homoptera:
Delphacidae) sucks rice plant’s sap along all growth
stages (but particularly at the milk stage) during which
it excretes honeydew, and honeydew causes further
fungal infection (Zhu et al. 2005).

Chemical insecticides are the main tools used to con-
trol SBPH and therefore to prevent the RSV disease.
Because of the chemicals’ harmful side effects on farm-
ers health, water quality, and rice quality in the com-
plex rice-based production systems, there is an urgent
need to explore and enhance the inherent control ability
of the crop ecosystem.

In general, the occurrence and prevalence of an in-
sect-vectored plant virus disease is affected by host
plant availability, growth stage, population dynamics,
transmission rate of the insect vector, and virulence
variation of virus.  The host plant availability, to a cer-
tain extent, is a time resource, which is exhibited by the
matching intensity among the vector, virus, and recep-
tor crop.  This matching intensity would be affected by
resistance variations in the host plant cultivar, sowing
and transplanting date (Cheng et al. 2002; Holt and
Chancellor 1999; Krell et al. 2005), soil nutrition con-
dition in the field, other previous pest occurrence and
injury, etc.

Among the factors affecting RSV, farming system
in a region, especially continuous cropping or even par-
tial intercropping of rice-wheat/barley year by year, sow-
ing date of directly sown rice and transplanting date of
transplanted rice (Zhu et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2007;
Cheng et al. 2002), directly affect the destination and
transfer rate of SBPH from maturing winter crops, such
as wheat and barley.  Normally, the earlier the sowing,
the higher the density of SBPH.  Nevertheless, when
the viruliferous rate of the vector is high, the effective
density of SBPH population would directly affect the
incidence rate of RSV.  Only a simple description can
be found in the literature about the hypothesis that
“rice sowing date affects the occurrence of rice stripe
disease”, and we found a remarkable difference in inci-
dence rate in rice fields sown on different dates in 2005.
A theoretical model of simulation analysis exists too
(Holt and Chancellor 1999), but no experimental proof

has been reported.  We therefore carried out a 2-year
field study to verify the effect of different sowing and
transplanting dates on incidence rate of RSV in the
single-season cropping of japonica rice in Jiaxing, north
of Zhejiang Province, where the disease has been an
ever-growing problem, and to find out the suitable sow-
ing/transplanting dates of single-season cropped rice to
avoid or reduce the incidence of RSV.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experiment site

The field experiment was carried out in Nanhu District,
Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, China.  Field plots were
set up in Yangzhuang village, Xinfeng, in 2006 and in
Qianliu village, Xinhuang, in 2007.  The rice variety
used was Xiushui 09, a japonica subspecies.  It was
transplanted under a single rice cropping system.

Experiment design

There was no insecticide treatment during seed prepa-
ration before sowing.  According to the experimental
design, seeds were sown on four dates: May 16, May
23, May 30, and June 6, with 7-d intervals in both 2006
and 2007.  Seedlings were transplanted to experimental
fields 30 d after sowing.  Three neighboring fields with
an area of 1340 m2 each was used as three replications.
Four plots in one field with 330 m2, each was used in
the four treatments of different transplanting dates (June
16, June 23, June 30, and July 5).  The experiment was
randomized complete block design of four treatments
with three replications each.  The usual fertilization and
water management measures were applied in the rice
nursery and during the early growth stage in the trans-
planted field; these were kept pesticide-free to obtain
the occurrence of the disease under natural conditions.
Normal management measures were given to the rice
crop in all plots from early August, when disease devel-
opment was maintained on a stable level.

Sampling method

transplanting was estimated from three batches of
seedlings, with each batch including at least 2 000
seedlings, from each plot sown on a different date.
The incidence of infected tillers and hills during the
stable period of the disease in the transplanted field
was determined using the following procedure.  Five
sampling points were chosen by a five-point sampling
method in each plot, 40 hills in each sampling point;
so a total of 200 hills per plot were carefully checked
and the number of infected and healthy tillers in each
hill were counted.  The percentages of infected hills
and infected tillers were computed.  Sampling was con-
ducted every 3 or 5 d until the stable period of inci-
dence development is achieved, approximately 40 d
after transplanting.

Yield assessment

When rice grain was mature, 200 hills were harvested
in the central part of each plot; the acreage of 200 hills
was measured.  Fresh weight was determined, and 1.5
kg of fresh grains from each plot were dried at 65oC
for 24 h for calculation of water content.  Grain yield
was transformed into dry weight.

Data analysis

Since the incidence rates were lower than 30%, the
data were square-root-transformed and analyzed us-
ing analysis of variance (ANOVA ) module in the widely
used Data Processing System (DPS) Statistical Pro-
gram (Tang and Feng 2007).  Means of treatments
were compared by the least significant difference
(LSD).  In the figure illustrating SBPH population
dynamics, the area under the curve of the population
dynamics (AUCPD, i.e, planthopper-day accumulation)
(Nutter 1997) in the rice nursery and in the early stages
of transplanted rice field until July 15 was calculated.
The logistic regression equations of the incidence rate
of the disease in late rice nursery (Inurs) against AUCPD
were obtained using the regression analysis module in
DPS.  Stepwise regression analysis was used to es-
tablish incidence in transplanted field (Ifield) against
AUCPD and incidence (Inurs) in nursery and AUCPD in
the early growth stage in transplanted field.  Yield data
were analyzed by ANOVA.

RESULTS

Population dynamics of SPBH in the rice nursery

In rice nursery sown on May 15, 2006, the SBPH mi-
grants were found during the first sampling time, and
the number increased linearly since then, reaching the
peak around June 10; with the delay of sowing date,
immigration of SBPH was naturally delayed and obser-
vation of peak population was postponed, resulting in a
remarkable decrease in peak density (Fig.1-A).  The
AUCPD in the four sowing dates in 2006 was 3432.5,
2 056.0, 1 025.0, 431.0 planthopper days, showing re-
markable decrease as sowing or transplanting date was
postponed.  The proportion of adult planthoppers
in the first and second transplanting date (91.20
and 85.43%) was also higher than the latter two
cases (65.58 and 75.47%).  In other words, most of
the planthopper individuals sampled in the nursery sown
earlier were immigrants.  The viruliferous rate in the
immigrants was detected as 2.43% in 2006; the den-
sity of effectively infected adults at peak population
was calculated as 4.76, 3.01, 1.07, and 0.53 individu-
als m-2.  Although only the peak density was sampled
(June 15) in 2007, the densities of SBPH in the nursery
sown on May 15 and May 22 were higher than those in
the nursery sown on May 29 and June 5 (Fig.1-B).

Incidence at the end of the seedling stage in the
nursery

Remarkable differences in disease incidence could be
found among sowing dates at the seedling stage (Table
1).  In 2006, the percentages of infected tillers in nurs-
ery sown on May 15 and May 22 were the highest at
3.26 and 2.25%, respectively.  The former was sig-
nificantly higher than the latter, and the both were sig-
nificantly higher than those in the nursery sown on
May 29 (0.24%) and June 5 (0%).  Similar results were
seen in 2007, suggesting that at the seedling stage, the
earlier the seedlings were sown, the more severe the
disease.

could be described using these logistic equations:

2006: Inurs = 3.3116/(1 + exp (6.3519 - 0.003489Anurs)), F = 5 600.3, P = 0.0094
         Inurs = 4.5275/(1 + exp (4.1711 - 0.025070Dnurs)), F = 367.2125, P = 0.0369
2007: Inurs = 7.0514/(1 + exp (4.0887 - 0.010615Dnurs)), F = 294.0, P = 0.0412

(1)
(2)
(3)

The Inurs in the equation was incidence rate at the end
of the seedling stage, Anurs was the AUCPD in the seed-
ling stage in 2006. Dnurs is the peak density at the seed-
ling stage in 2006 and 2007.

When the data of 2006 and 2007 were combined, a
united nonlinear regression analysis was established to
be the following equation (Fig.2):

Inurs = 4.7234/(1 + exp (6.6395 - 0.037441Dnurs)), F (2, 7) = 65.863; r = 0.9815, P = 0.0003

(4)

Eq. 4 could describe the change in incidence rate
along with the change in peak density of the SBPH.
Incidence rate was very low at low insect density and
increased rapidly after that.  The inflection point of this
logistic curve was a density of 200 individuals per m2.
After that, incidence rate did not increase remarkably

Incidence of the disease in its epidemic stable
period in transplanted field

According to the incidence values sampled at the stable
period of the disease epidemics, a close relationship
between sowing date and disease occurrence could be
seen (Table 2).  Such relations existed across years, i.e.,
sowing date affected the incidence rate remarkably (in
2006: F (3, 11) = 63.0, P = 0.0001; in 2007: F (3, 11) =
256.6, P = 0.0001).  The results demonstrated the close
relationship between sowing/transplanting date and in-
cidence degree: the earlier the sowing, the more seri-
ous the disease.  This trend was similar to that noted in
the nursery.

two sowing dates were not remarkably different, start-
ing on July 10 both in 2006 and 2007, whereas such
stages began on July 15 in the third and fourth sowing
dates, indicating the end of symptom-performance-pro-
cess appearance of the primitively infected virus in the
earlier growth stage of rice; since then, the incidence
lasted for a long time or it decreased slowly because of
infected tillers dying out (Fig.3-B).

The relationship between sowing data and RSV inci-
dence was clearly shown in Fig.3.  Incidence decreased
along with a delay of sowing.  The incidence was not
significantly different in the first two sowing dates, and
each of them was significantly more severe than the
latter two.  In 2006, incidence (% hills infected) reached
50%  on  June  30,  July  3,  July  10,  and  July  10,
respectively; whereas in 2007, it was on July 6, July 6,
July 8, and July 10, respectively, which was delayed
along with the delay in sowing/transplanting in general.
The relationship between the incidence of RSV disease
in the transplanted rice field (Ifield) and sowing date (S,
number of days after May 1) could be described using
a Weibull function:

circles refer to data in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Dynamics  of  RSV  disease  incidence  in
transplanted rice fields

The development of RSV disease in the transplanted
field occurred in four stages: initiation stage, rapidly
increasing stage, stable stage, and decreasing stage.
From Fig.3, the starting time of disease development
(starting date) was different, along with the different
sowing data.  With earlier sowing, the disease occurred
earlier, with disease symptoms appearing 2-7 d after
transplanting.  The rapidly increasing stages in the fields
of different sowing dates were similar-they lasted 15 d
from June 25 to July 10 in 2006 and 14 d from June 28
to July 12 in 2007.  The stable stages across the first

Ifield = 17.3334 × (1 - exp (-((S + 7.3395)/29.4974)^(- 7.8111))), F (3, 23) = 71.5721, r = 0.9564, P = 0.0001(5)
The incubation period (IP) of the virus in the rice
field could therefore be calculated from the disease epi-
demic curves (Fig.3).  In 2006, the SBPH in the nurs-
ery sown on May 15 increased rapidly on June 12,
whereas the peak of disease symptom increased sud-
denly on July 3.  Therefore, IP was 21 d; similarly, an
IP of 21 d was noted (June 15 and July 10) in rice
sown on May 29; the IP was 22 d for rice sown on
June 5, suggesting that along with the delay of sowing,
IP was shortened gradually.  This phenomenon may be
related to temperature increase in the days correspond-
ing to delayed sowing dates (Jin et al. 1985).

First, a series of symbols in the following equations
have been annotated: Ifield, incidence (% hills infected)
in the stable period in transplanted field; S, sowing date
(number of days after May 1st); Anurs, AUCPD of the
planthopper in the seedling stage; Inurs, incidence (%
tillers infected) at the end of seedling stage; Afield, the

planthopper in transplanted field; Dnurs, the population
peak density of the planthopper at the seedling stage.

Polynomial regression was conducted for the experi-
mental data obtained in 2006; it is shown as follows:

Ifield =31.221358 - 0.836401S - 0.113684Dnurs+ 6.407682Inurs + 0.002808Afield

(6)

Where the partial correlation coefficients r (Ifield, S)=
-0.7769, t = 3.2644, P = 0.0115; r (Ifield, Dnurs) = -0.6168,
t = 2.0735, P = 0.0718; r (Ifield, Inurs) = 0.6084, t = 2.0284,

4.6722; P = 0.0001; and correlation coefficient after
adjustment ra=0.9712; adjusted determinant coefficient
r2 = 0.9433.

A stepwise regression equation was established for

the same data set as follows:

Ifield = 32.676532 - 0.872762S - 0.125540Dnurs + 7.255288Inurs

(7)

Where the partial coefficients r (Ifield, S) = -0.7903,

P=0.0312; r (Ifield, Inurs)=0.6856, t=2.6634, P=0.0259.
Multiple correlation coefficient r = 0.9808, F (3, 8)
= 6.74617, P = 0.0001; and the correlation coefficient
after adjustment ra = 0.9735; adjusted determinant co-
efficient r2 = 0.9477.

When Eq.(7) was compared with Eq.(6), it was clear
that without the Afield in transplanted field, all the signifi-

cant levels of the partial correlation coefficients between
Ifield, S, Dnurs, and Inurs, multiple correlation coefficients,
and correlation coefficient after adjustment of these three
independent variables (S, Dnurs, and Inurs) increased, sug-
gesting that the description and prediction ability of the
regression equation increased.

On the basis of experimental results of 2007, the
polynomial regression equation was established as
follows:

Ifield = 15.587254 - 0.431861S - 0.013564Dnurs + 3.133022Inurs- 0.003224Afield

t = 3.8582, P = 0.0048; r (Ifield, Afield) = -0.2045, t =
0.5528, P = 0.5955.  Multiple correlation coeffi-

cient r = 0.9955; F (4, 7) = 19.2128; P = 0.0001,
and correlation coefficient after adjustment ra =
0.9929; and adjusted determinant coefficient r2 =
0.9858.

Its stepwise regression equation is:

Where the partial regression coefficients r (Ifield, S)=
-0.8512, t= 4.5872, P = 0.0013; r (Ifield, Dnurs)= -0.3564,

F (3, 8) = 28.0410; P = 0.0001, correlation coefficient
after adjustment ra = 0.9935; and adjusted determinant
coefficient r2 = 0.9871.

It was obvious that, similar to the stepwise regres-
sion equation of 2006, the exclusion of the factor Afield

in the stepwise equation of 2007 increased the signifi-
cant level of all partial regression coefficients, correla-
tion coefficient after adjustment, and multiple correla-
tion coefficient.

Since the independent variables screened in the equa-
tions of both 2006 and 2007 were the same, the data
of both years were pooled for analysis; the regression
equation including four factors were obtained as
follows:

Ifield = 15.045572S - 0.404805Dnurs - 0.017606Inurs + 3.264654Inurs + 0.002715Afield

-0.4879, t = 2.4363, P = 0.0243; r (I field, I nurs) =
0.7363, t = 4.7425, P = 0.0001; r (I field, A field) =
0.1764, t = 0.7813, P = 0.4438.  Multiple correla-

tion coefficient r = 0.9824; F(4, 19) = 13.1065,
P = 0.0001, correlation coefficient after adjustment
ra = 0.9786; and adjusted determinant coefficient
r2 = 0.9577.

Its stepwise regression equation is:

Ifield = 16.733407 - 0.451974S- 0.02056Dnurs + 3.484801Inurs

(11)

Its partial regression coefficient r (Ifield, S) =-0.8305,
t=6.6667, P=0.0001; r (Ifield, Dnurs)=-0.6021, t=3.3724,
P=0.0029; r (Ifield, Inurs)=0.7816, t=5.6032, P=0.0001;
multiple correlation coefficient, r = 0.9818; F (3, 20) =
17.8017; P = 0.0001, correlation coefficient after ad-
justment ra = 0.9790; and adjusted determinant coeffi-
cient r2 = 0.9577.

With the exclusion of Afield in the new equation (Eq.
11), both partial regression coefficients and the F value
of three included factors increased.  So the incidence (%

seedling stage Inurs; whereas the AUCPD calculated from
the density of SBPH in the early growth stage in trans-
planted field was an unnecessary factor for the descrip-
tion of RSV incidence rate in the transplanted field.

Yield assessment

The statistical analysis of actual yield showed that the
final yield of each sowing date was not significantly
different (P > 0.05) in 2006; the grain yields among
either the former three or the last three sowing dates in
2007 were significantly different from each other, al-
though the yield of first sowing was remarkably higher
than that of last (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

The results described in this research clearly proved
the hypothesis that rice sowing/transplanting date sig-
nificantly affects RSV incidence.  Under insecticide-
free conditions, RSV incidence was serious in early-
sown and transplanted rice fields, which was mainly
related to the viral transmission characteristics and im-
migration period of the virus-bearing vectors.  If the
sensitive period of rice seedlings in the nursery was
consistent with the immigration peak period of the high
virus-born adults of the SBPH of the first generation,
which emerged from wheat, barley, and other over-
wintering crops/grasses, the disease would be more
serious.  In Jiaxing, north Zhejiang Province, the immi-

gration peak of the first generation of adult planthoppers
is around mid-late May (Wang et al. 2008).  If rice was
sown and seedlings emerged in this period, the virus-
carrying SBPH from the wheat, rye grass, and gramin-
eous weeds nearby would transfer to the rice nursery
or to the directly sown rice field.  With a smaller sow-
ing area holding the planthoppers, the vectors could
aggregate in the nursery and transmit the virus in high
concentrations.  Nevertheless, seedlings at growth
stages from the 2 leaf and 1 leaflet to the 4 leaf and 1
leaflet are the most sensitive to infection of RSV dis-
ease (Jin et al. 1985; Wang et al. 2008) and thus could
be highly infected with the first peak of transmission.
The first batch of infected young seedlings showed
RSV symptoms at the early growth stage in transplanted
field after 20-30 d of latent period.  From early June,
the main components of the SBPH population were the
small nymphs that are too weak to move.  With in-
creasing  temperature,  its  population  decreased.
Therefore, viral transmission rate decreased largely in
the seedlings sown during this period, and the disease
had low incidence.  The difference in sowing date would
result in a difference in virus-bearing vector density in
the seedlings and correspondingly a significant differ-
ence in RSV incidence in seedlings and transplanted
plants.

Sowing early to avoid the dispersal peak of the SBPH
had historically been used to reduce incidence of viral
diseases.  In Japan, for instance, the incidence of RSV
was low when sowing was done in early April and was
most serious when sowing done in May; incidence
would be lower again if sowing is done after May (Hibino
1996).  Actually, it was caused by the different degrees
of overlapping and matching between the activity peaks
of adults and larger nymphs’ viral transmission peak
and the critical vulnerable growth stage of rice.  Those
early sown rice seedlings were in the 5-leaf stage with
low sensitivity to RSV infection when the first-genera-
tion adults transferred from the wheat fields during
harvest.  This particular case and our experiment had
demonstrated that “availability of host plants has a re-
markable effect on the SBPH population and its trans-
mitted RSV disease”. The essential mechanism is to vary
the chances of the SBPH population to use the host plant
resources, i.e., matching between dispersal peak of the
vector and the sensitive growth stage of rice.

This availability concept could be used in pest con-
trol effectively.  Sowing and transplanting on the ap-
propriate date is one of the most effective methods of
controlling disease epidemics.  Even if the field is not
put in fallow for a long time and on a large scale, a
suitable date of planting can reduce vector density and
the viral diseases they transmit.  Some successful ex-
amples of control are those of the tabacci whitefly and
cases involving eggplant and tobacco in India, okra and
cotton in Mexico, tomato and common bean in Egypt,
and cantaloupe in California (Hilje et al. 2001).  Sowing
at the proper time has been used in the agricultural con-
trol of anthracnose and viral disease of water yam,
Dioscorea alata L. (Egesi et al. 2007).  A field experi-
ment showed that late sowing can reduce soybean beetle
Cerotoma trifurcate population density, but its role in
the control of the bean pod mottle virus transmitted by
the beetle was found to be not consistent among differ-
ent years (Egesi et al. 2007).  In Nigeria, if bean sow-
ing was done after June 1, the frogeye leaf spot disease
would be more serious and yield would decrease (Akem
and Dashiell 1994).

Current tactics to control RSV include using pesti-
cides to control vector density and the transmission
process and to deploy resistant varieties.  If resistant
varieties are lacking for large-scale extension, chemical
control  remains  as  the  main  management  tactic.
Unfortunately, the insecticides used generally did not
show results as promised.  Therefore other agronomic
tactics should take on the major role.  The successful
cases of other crop vector disease systems mentioned
earlier could be duplicated, and the results from this
study can be further used to design a proper rice sow-
ing/transplanting scheme to control the RSV disease
effectively.

For this purpose, other factors such as geographical
condition, light and temperature regime, characteris-
tics of rice variety, virus-carrying rate of the vector,
and density during peak viral transmission of the vec-
tor (Wen 2003) should be thoroughly considered.  The
yield loss caused by different pests and diseases and
the benefit-cost trade-off of control tactics should be
considered.  For the current period and in the near fu-
ture in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, single-season cropping of
japonica rice has been the main cropping system, and
this  will  not  have  any  significant  effect  on  rice

development, yield, and quality.  Optimal sowing date
can be late May to early June to avoid immigration of
large viruliferous SBPH population.  This sowing “win-
dow” is experimentally supported from other indepen-
dent agronomic experimental data in the Yangtze Delta
region, e.g., Jiaixang of Zhejiang (Gao and Zhang 2005),
Changzhou of Jiangsu (Chen et al. 2003), Fengxian of
Shanghai (Shen 2003), which indicated that the suit-
able sowing date for single-cropped japonica rice is from
mid May to mid June.  Rice sown during this suitable
period can avoid overgrowing of rice population caused
by sowing too early, and the damage of low tempera-
ture during heading stage in mid to late September in
over-late sown field.  Rice sown in late May can give
the largest yield, with the best quality (Shen 2003),
though some experimental results suggest that sowing
on May 15 could give the largest harvest.  Mean yields
from fields sown from May 10 to May 30 were not
significant.  On the basis of the yield assessed as re-
ported in this article, there is no significant difference
between May 15 and May 29 sowing in 2 years, and
the yield from rice sown in this period was not remark-
ably different from that sown in early June in one year.
This result demonstrates the suitability of the simple
rule of “sowing from late May to early June”, which is
not only to reduce RSV transmission but also to fall
within the proper range of sowing period for normal
years proposed by agronomists (Mao et al. 2001).

Because of the complexity of determining optimal
sowing date, which is affected by multiple factors as
mentioned above, we applied the stepwise regression
equations established in this study to predict actual in-
cidence and validate its effectiveness.  Through a com-
bination of the experimental results of the effect of sow-
ing and transplanting dates on the occurrence and the
damage caused by other rice pests such as rice stem
borer, rice leaffolder, brown planthopper, and the rice
yield components and final yield, we analyzed the inte-
grative profit of the different sowing and transplanting
dates.  At the same time, by using experimental data on
rice variety with characteristics of different light and
temperature requirements, development rate, potential
yield, different responses to pest injury, and through
the development of a rice production simulation model,
we input the submodels describing the interrelation
among sowing/transplanting date, density of planthopper

population, viruliferous and viral transmission rates, and
final incidence rates of RSV disease established in this
experiment.  The modeling analysis will optimize the
owing/transplanting date of different varieties and fur-
ther support optimal decisions for multiple objectives,
which  include  economic  profit,  environmental
soundness, and human health.

CONCLUSION

The hypothesis “sowing/transplanting date has signifi-
cant effects on the incidence of rice stripe disease”
was experimentally verified in this article.  From the
point of view of integrated pest management, rice sow-
ing/transplanting within a proper range of time is one
of the most effective ways to control rice stripe disease.
The optimal sowing date of single-season cropped
japonica rice is recommended to be from late May to
early June in north Zhejiang, China.
